I can't deny this author is very talented. Her writing style is riviting and her story telling is addicting and unforgettable. The content of the story however is extremely disturbing and my child was required to read the story in school. She came home after only a few days and asked to be removed from the class while the story was being read because of how uncomfortable it made her feel. I read the story to see what they were asking the kids to read in school. I get that the author is a fantastic writer but I can't endorse this book because of the disturbing story content and I am certainly against it being required reading in school.
