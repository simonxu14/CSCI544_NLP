I liked the book.  It was slow in the beginning.  The End was great but very sad I was very sorry that Prim which was the whole start of the Hunger Games died.  Was very surprised.  Book was very good could not wait until I was reading it again. Hope for another...Because of my Grand Daughter Domo who assigned me to read all the books before the Movie came out, which I did but I liked the books better they left out one of the most important parts when Marge give the mockingjay pin to Katness....
