The author does a good job of creating suspense from the beginning.  But then, the characters that are actually in the fight to the death don't seem to be all that psychologically affected by their impending death. In fact, no one seems all that affected by it.  She barely touches on this issue at all.  You would think that they were just racing for a prize much less serious than life itself. I don't know why people think this is a good book. Not only do the characterize have to stay alive, but they have to try and kill each other.  But you'd think there was nothing but a trophy and bragging rights at the end of the tunnel.<br /><br />The characters not well developed, and it's very predictable.  It was quite the let down.  I keep trying to find good stories with good writing.... I'm still looking. I'll see the other two on-screen.  But I will not be wasting my precious reading time on the rest of this trilogy.  It's not a good book, if while you're reading it, you can already envision the movie, and what actors will play which characters.
