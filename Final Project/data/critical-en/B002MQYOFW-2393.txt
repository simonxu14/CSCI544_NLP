After all the hype, and many of my friends insisting I read the book, I did. I'm glad Amazon take Kindle returns.<br /><br />The story is incredibly banal. The characters are flat, and the editing is very bad. Katniss, I just want to throttle: she's the least likable heroine I've personally ever read, and she doesn't grow or develop at all during the book. No, she's as flat & lifeless as the villains are boring & trite.<br /><br />I know it seems harsh, and it probably is, but this is a very unintelligent book in every sense. It might be a fun ride for some (many), but it just pained me to try & read this mess. I could nitpick, but it's just not worth the time for me to do so. That's my opinion. Take it for what it's worth.
