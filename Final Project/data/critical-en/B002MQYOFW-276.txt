Saying goodbye to this trilogy is difficult. Intense and thought-provoking! I don't believe I've ever read anything dealing with Apocalyptic circumstances that was better or more compelling. Found myself thinking that "yes, this is how it would probably be." People would not have learned lessons from what brought them to this place in history. Selfishness and the desire for power would still rule the day. Politics and lies in the name of the "greater good" would run rampant. On the other hand there would be those willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for the good of what humanity remains and those who would risk it all to bring hope.<br /><br />Labeling these books as being "young adult" material does them a great disservice and turns away readers who would love them as much as I did.<br /><br />I look forward to Ms. Collins future books and applaud her accomplishments with this magnificent tale!!<br /><br />Overall I loved the trilogy but this was my least favorite of the three...Seemed to drag a little at some points.
