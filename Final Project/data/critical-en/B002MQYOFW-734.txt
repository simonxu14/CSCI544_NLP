I purchased this boxed set as a gift and wanted the hard cover book version rather than the paperback version.<br /><br />The books in this set are "hard covered" but I was somewhat disappointed because (in my opinion) they are not the same quality as the book we got when we checked out "The Hunger Games" book at our local library.<br /><br />The library book had a more sturdy front and back cover plus the pages of the book appeared to be of a better quality.  The library book was just like I expected a book would be.<br /><br />The books in this boxed set are "hard cover" but the covers are not as "sturdy" as the above metioned library book.  Plus the pages in this boxed set appear to have paper that is thinner than the libray edition.  As I turn the pages of the books in in this boxed set, I feel like I have to be especially careful for fear of putting a "bend" in the page.
