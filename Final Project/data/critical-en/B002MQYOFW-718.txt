Finished this book last night.  I was disappointed in the character development in this book.  Katniss just seemd like a vehicle for the author to share her views on war.  Katniss is absent and Ms. Collins is now here.  Where did the main character go?  Mostly she is sleeping, hiding, recovering, etc and not part of the story.  I found it hard to imagine how someone could be the face of the rebellion who was not around much.  Lastly, her and Peeta suffer from PTSD and eventually carve out a life together.  The End.
