**SPOILER REVIEW**<br /><br />Let me start off by telling you the first book was the best. I could not put it down until the end. When I came accross the third book, I wasn't even close to enjoying it. First off, the book was very slow and dissapointing. In my opinion, the ending was HORRIBLE. Katniss, who was best friends with Gale from the start, doesn't even talk to him for the rest of her life. Also, it was quite depressing since she lived in a ruined district with two neighbors which she then ended up to marry one. The only reason I continued reading this book was to figure out what the outcome was.Don't waste your time. Just look it up online.
