While I purchased this to understand the hype around the movie (Still haven't seen that). Its a good read. But that's it. I don't see this becoming a classic. The darker tones of this story of kids killing kids and the bleak future they all have is a premise that's been done several times in better books. (Harry Potter anyone?)<br /><br />** Warning, I have vague hints for spoilers below **<br /><br />I had a hard time even liking Katniss as the story progresses. After the first book I totally despised her. She didn't seem real. Even with the whirlwind of activity going on around her and the faster pace of the later books, she just comes across as... A whiny bitch. I was actually rooting for her death several times, hoping that maybe one of the minor characters that I empathized with more would come to the front to finish the story.<br /><br />A story should never disinterest its readers from the main character. While I may have lost some interest in other books (more from getting interested in other things than losing interest in the books) The hunger games trilogy is a set where I read it once and I won't be reading it again. If you are a fan of the movie and you want to read the books, enjoy, but its not kid material. While not detailed in its graphic of people dying, it is graphic enough that some kids may have nightmares.<br /><br />I'm selling my trilogy after one read, Now i wish I had just been able to get it from the Library.
