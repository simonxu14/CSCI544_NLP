Do not like. Horribly written speaking from one who does not write well either. Too much violence and forcing children to kill, too much focus on makeup and design and not enough on plot and character development. No history of how things came to be (except district 13 rebellion  and downfall) and the fall of the previous country to usher in this crazy government.  At least the movie was far better because other writers improved on it.
