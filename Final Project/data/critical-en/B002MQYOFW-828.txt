addictive quick read - sets the mood - bit recycle-y with yet another 'games' (at the capitol), and due to the author's format of chapters and sections, a quick parade of attempts to tie up plotlines and characters (not always successfully). Probably the biggest beef I had was the hero's hospital peek-a-boo literary device. Something cool is about to happen and - oops - back to the hospital you go! We'll devote a paragraph to what happened (which was 'really' important btw you shoulda-seen-it!) - if we remember - maybe. No time for that important stuff anyway, but here's a chapter about doing nothing except playing with the cat with a flashlight (spoiler).
