With all the hype surrounding this book and the movie, I decided to read (screen) the book before allowing it into the hands of my 12 and 13 year old children. The book has a couple of redeeming qualities. First, it does an excellent job proving out the depravity of mankind. It is not hard to imagine that some the concepts in this book could become reality (in some ways they already are). Second, in a world without God, it makes perfect sense that the characters are disillusioned, dysfunctional, and have no problems with killing each other. These are lessons worth teaching children, but this book is probably not the best way to do that.<br /><br />This book is about children killing children and it's about the failure of their parents and/or adults standing up to defend their children (for fear of their own death). It's about a teenage girl offering herself as a substitute "sacrifice" for her 12-year-old sister with no intervention from the girl's mother or from "friends." This book suggests no hope, no moral lessons, and nothing of redeeming value save learning what a godless, depraved society might look like. The popularity of this book and the movie make it clear why we see so many incidents of children killing children in our society today. The children who perform these acts have no hope. Who will tell them there is hope? I recommend reading the Bible instead. It's got lots of killing, but there is a redemptive message of hope thread throughout for those who are willing to accept it.<br /><br />My children will not be reading this book, nor will we see the movie.
