Katniss is a young woman of 16 living in a place called District 12 where all residents must work in coal mines for existence.  Residents in the capital city of the country benefit from what is produced by the districts but don't allow the people in the other districts to prosper.  Every year, the districts must provide a young girl and boy to participate in The Hunger Games, a game in which only 1 participant can survive.  The games serve as a display of the strength of the capital city over the districts and keeps them in line.  The surviving winner is given many benefits so each district hopes to have the winner which gives them hope and distracts them from revolting.  Katniss, whose survival skills are evident before she begins the games, appears a shoo in winner but another member of her district in the Hunger Games brings in a new complication, love and affection.  Districts begin to revolt after watching the game and the three books cover the games and the revolts.  The story was Ok in my opinion, better in the 1st book and weaker in the 2nd and 3rd books.
