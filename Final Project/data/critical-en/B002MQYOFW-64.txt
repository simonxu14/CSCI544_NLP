(NO SPOILERS) I loved Hunger Games and I liked Catching Fire...but Mockingjay is a surreal mix of horrific violence, drug-induced psychosis/disconnection, and political scenarios that are too convoluted to be thought-provoking or relevant.<br /><br />To start, I can't imagine this is classified as a Young Adult novel - the mass death scenarios are bloody, cruel, and unrelenting.  As a mother, I found some of the depictions of violence against children to be almost literally vomit-inducing (and one of my favorite shows is Dexter, so I'm not one to shy away from violence).  It is, without a doubt, too emotionally and graphically intense for young readers.  I almost wish I hadn't read some of the scenes myself - they will stay with me for a long time.<br /><br />Second, the highly elaborate, gory and gratuitous deaths presented in the book can only be compared to one of the "Saw" franchise movies.  Hmm, we haven't yet had the skin melt off of someone entirely, so let's do that.  Next let's trigger a barbed wire death cage, or any of several varieties of airborne poison/acid/drugs.  This all happens not in some game arena, mind you, but on residential city streets as an apparent method of national defense.  Really?  Alarmingly elaborate booby-traps as a defense strategy? I recognize this is science fiction, but even science fiction has limits on absurdity.  These scenarios are absurd.<br /><br />Relatedly, regarding the plot, it is clear that the author glossed over many points integral to the story-line, perhaps because her stronger suit is flowery monologues and dramatically elaborate deaths.  A lot of what could be truly interesting about this novel (political intrigue, rescue, revolt, and national recovery) happens off-screen, while Katniss is recovering from one mental breakdown after another.  Every time she surfaces from her mental fogs, the world has again shifted without description or real explanation.  Frankly, it's lazy writing.<br /><br />In sum, I'm genuinely displeased that I read this novel.  I'm left with nothing but ugly images of violence and a hollow pit in my stomach, and I don't even have the satisfaction of a good plot resolution to make me feel better about it.
