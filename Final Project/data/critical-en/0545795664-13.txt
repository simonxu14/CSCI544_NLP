While my kids absolutely love this (ages 7, 8) the book falls apart after a few readings.  We bought this after the paperback book fell apart on us.  If the pages would stay together it would have been perfect. I have bought three of them and they have all fallen apart.<br />Each page features a different Pok&eacute;mon and shows its evolutions.  It is colorful and interesting even to me (I am not a Pok&eacute;mon fan).
