I'm only 6 chapters into the first book and i'm loving the story! Well done Collins! I give it 5 stars!<br /><br />HOWEVER, I'm giving my review 3 stars because the eBook is a bit "buggy." The font sizes don't match up with the rest of my other books on my Kindle--it's bigger than normal. And the font will randomly change itself after I change the page. It seems to specifically do it each chapter!<br /><br />Amazon, could you please update this!?
