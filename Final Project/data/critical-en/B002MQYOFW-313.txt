I just finished reading the book last night, and it left me feeling mad, upset, disappointed!  How in the world could the author end the book this way????  She spends about 90% of the book building up the confrontation between Katniss and Snow, and blah...we get nothing.  I read intently for 2.5 books about the Peeta and Gale triangle, and blah...once again nothing.  So many plots sewn up with one or two pages of resolution.  There is nothing I can't stand more than leaving a reader hanging.  The author must have been to scared to use her writing skills to fulfill what she has been promising this whole time.  She felt the need to cop out of her responsibility to all of us readers.<br /><br />Also, people believe that the negative reviews have to do with a missing fairytale ending.  However, I have to say that the entire series is a bunch of 'fairytale endings' with her winning the first games, surviving the second games, so why can't we expect it from the 3rd?  I didn't even need it to end happily, but at least deeply would have been better than flat.<br /><br />This was an unbelievable ending and not in a good way.
