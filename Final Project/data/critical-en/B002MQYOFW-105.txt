I've just got into the Hunger Games books recently and I've been really loving them. So I was surprised to see reviews for Mockingjay be considerably lower than the first two. But, it is justified, Mockingjay is the weakest entry in the set. My major disappointment is feeling that Katniss isn't entirely the main vehicle through which the plot moves forward. I feel like there's this great story going on in the background, however, the reader only gets bits and pieces of it while primarily being dumped with Kat's teen love angst. Even for a trauma-experienced repeatedly emotionally and physically shattered teenage girl, some of her feelings, motivations and subsequent decisions just do not feel logical. If a certain stimulus happens in the plot, you could imagine there would be a handful of responses to it. However, the response ends up being something almost entirely unrelated and unimportant given said stimulus or the current situation the characters are in. If you've read the first two, you have to read Mockingjay to finish this great story. It's just a shame that said great story shifts to the background for most of this book while we only get Katniss struggling to unravel feelings that do not make sense to anyone, even her.
