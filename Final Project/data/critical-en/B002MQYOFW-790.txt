I am surprised that these books were written for teens. They are gruesome! Perhaps I have a more active imagination than others, but when I read it's like I'm watching a movie in my mind. I could not believe some of the things that happened to children in these books. It's a morbid flashback to the Roman coliseum, but the atrocities are inflicted on children by children.<br /><br />The books are an easy, fast read. I read the whole trilogy in 3 days. The first book is definitely the best from a literary perspective. It has a decent plot, suspense, climax and resolution. Book 2 is basically the same plot as Book 1 just with different horrors. Book 3 just feels like the author is rushing to finish the series. It's predictable, poorly written, and once again gruesome. The stuff of nightmares.
