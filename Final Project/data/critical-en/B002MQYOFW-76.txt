I've got tickets for the theatrical release of HG this Friday, so I spent time re-reading all three books in the trilogy.  Hunger Games is an outstanding novel.  The remaining books, particularly this one, were let downs.<br /><br />The main issue  that I have is the lack of hopefulness in the novels....to the point that a song of suicide is included.  Way too nihilistic.  Way too introspective.  The inclusion of a 13 year old  in a duplex firebomb was unbelievable from a military perspective and gratuitous.<br /><br />I know this won't stop anyone from reading the trilogy, but it was a very dissatisfying ending to what might have been a great trilogy.
