Well. for me the book should have ended in the Forbidden Forest.  But it goes on.  Why, I don't know because the book rather goes down hill from there.  it is worth the purchase...and those of us at my workplace that read the book, can't believe it continued after That point.  we have our pet theories on why she had it continue on past that.<br /><br />Basicly, its a 3 hour book. start to finish un interupted all those pages.  one of the others made it in 5 hours. so your actual reading time may vary.<br /><br />it was certianly more action packed then any other book, explained very little and left you wondering, "okay I've read 7 books and I STILL have no idea why we're all in love with them" and then your thought goes to "I wonder how they'll screen write this book to movie"
