When a book becomes part of the culture to the degree that this book has, reviews are pretty much superfluous.  You, reading this, have either already read “The Hunger Games” or you have a pretty good idea of whether or not you want to read it.  As for myself, I downloaded it years ago when it was on sale and finally got around to reading it.  I haven’t seen the movies, but I’m familiar with the concept – tough girl in a dystopian world is selected to fight other children/teens to the death and there’s some sort of love triangle.  It’s a promising plot (I loved it when it was “Battle Royale,” both the book and the movie).  The “problem,” for me at least, is two-fold.  Katniss just isn’t interesting and the plot is too reliant on developments that literally fall from the sky when the story stalls.<br /><br />Katniss is the type of character that happens when an author mistakes something like “determination” for personality.  She’s determined to survive, she can hunt and . . . there isn’t that much else to her.  As for the plot, it’s impossible to mistake the feeling of construction that hems the story in.  I could never relax into the story because I kept seeing the crude toolmarks of how Collins decided to move the plot forward.  The cutesy name of the capitol, the almost-literal deux ex machina way items kept falling from the sky, not once, but again and again throughout the games whenever things looked hopeless or dull for our heroine.  I was never able to fully engage with Katniss or the story itself.
