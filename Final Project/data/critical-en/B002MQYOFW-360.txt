If you are planning on seeing the movie "Hunger Games", and if that reason is because someone else wants you to see it because it is a great book, then I have one bit of advice for you....read the book first then decide.<br />Now for those of you who have forgotten your history North America rose in rebellion and the victorious capitol region divided the country into 12 districts. All of which get to send two teenage citizens a year in a competition to the death. And death they most certainly do. And this is the big problem I have the book is the whole sanitization of teenage death. Now before you get ready to send me an angry note  I do realize that was the point, it was a critique. A critique on violence in the communities, the extremes that reality TV is going to (when I was reading this the MTV reality TV show about teenage pregnant girls was popular) However I personally do not think it went far enough. This book, apparently targeted towards young adults could have actually been a significant piece of literature , instead, the author chickened out and played it safe.<br />Now on an intellectual level it was lacking. On a enjoyment level it was actually pretty good. I don't feel it was a ripoff of Running Man as some of the more sci-fi diehards among my friends have complained. It was a book, and no doubt satisfying for many people. Not everyone reads books to have worlds of thought opened for them. If it gets people reading books again then this is great. Despite my irrefutable thoughts to the contrary, not every book is written to please me.<br />If you are expecting this to be the most meaningful book every written you will be in for a major disappointment, but as a way to pass a day or two reading instead of watching the television, this is the right book for you.
