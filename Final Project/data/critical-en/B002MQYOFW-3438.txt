The book has yet to arrive, I ordered the book over a month ago, I have emailed Great Bargain twice and still no response, so as far as I am concerned it was not such a "Great Bargain" after all, so I cannot recommend this seller.<br />Maybe if I get an email and explanation I will change my mind.<br /><br />P.S.I only gave a star so the review would publish
