Assuming most will want to read the trilogy my summary view is it should have been one book.  Book two was a waste of time,  it was a repeat of book 1.  The plot line was repetitive. Post apocalyptic setting.  Emotionally tortured girl is involved in a pursuit, girl gets hurt, girl has moody recovery then does it again and again and again.  While I was reading it it was okay but at the end it felt like an hour on the treadmill.
