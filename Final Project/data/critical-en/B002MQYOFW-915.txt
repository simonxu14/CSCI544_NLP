I really dislike this book. Not that I didn't enjoy reading it, because I did. it's just that the characters grate on me, and any characters I do like pretty much all die. Except the cat. Heh.<br /><br />First, there is Peeta. Not one of my favorites. I mean yeah, he's got plenty of backstory and I liked him in the first book, but all this drama I feel is a bit unnecessary. Why not Gale or someone else?<br /><br />Katniss. I don't understand her at all. She almost turned into Bella, but luckily that crisis was averted. And her thoughts at the ending? What?<br /><br />Prim. Poor prim. Why Collins?<br /><br />Otherwise I loved the book, and it was an enjoyable one. That's all for now, folks!
