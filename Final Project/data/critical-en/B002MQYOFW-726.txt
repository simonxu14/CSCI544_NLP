It only gets 2 stars because I liked the first two books otherwise it would be a 1 star. Why is the last book always they worst? Between this series and the divergent series I won't be reading any more series from while. Total disapointment! I finished the last chapter and thought really? Did I miss something? There is no way this is the end! She rushed the ending without telling you what happened to most of the characters. Why not kill them off like you did to almost all of the others in the last 30 pages of the book? Awful way to end a series that could have been truly great!
