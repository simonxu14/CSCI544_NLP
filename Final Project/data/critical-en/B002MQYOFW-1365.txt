This third book was definitely better than the second book by far, but still not as a good as the first book.  I felt like the author was speeding things up near the middle and end and the pace started to get too quick (almost like she had a deadline or she did not want to go over a certain amount of page numbers).  That was one thing I did not like about the book.<br /><br />The second thing that I did not like is......SPOILER ALERT................was that the author had to kill all those children in the end, especially Prim, Katniss's sister.  I felt that it was a quick story line that did not fit well into the whole story.  The story was just about over, so why kill off children.  Now I am wondering how they are gonna portray that in a movie, unless they cut it out altogether.  It was all unneccesary and again, was so quick.  I felt like there was a different author for the end of the book.  If......SPOILER ALERT......President Coin had to die, there could have been another reason!<br /><br />Overall, it was a good book until the end.  It could have been better.  I do recommend the trilogy though.
