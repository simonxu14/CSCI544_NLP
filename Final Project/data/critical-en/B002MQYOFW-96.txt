Of course the first book  - our introduction to the Hunger Games, ended as a cliff hanger.  Actually each chapter was a cliff hanger  - I couldn't put it down.  The second was only slightly diminished but with a very nice twist at the end leaving me wanting more.  Then the third, which have some have shared is much darker - especially as the characters we have come to love have become jaded and "hijacked' by the war.  But - to be honest - this is a subject about war and power and those most vulnerable - and it tells this story well.<br /><br />Until the end, when it feels like, for the sake of brevity, the book comes to a climatic, then anti-climatic end, with loose ends that get tied up roughly rather than in the meticulous fashion of the first two books.  I won't spoil the ending.  I think the climatic ending has merits, but was never fully explained.  The anti-climatic ending will have readers disappointed though - not because of how the story ultimately ends, but in the process to get to that ending.<br /><br />There, hope  I didn't spoil the ending for anyone.
