This was my least favorite installment of the Hunger Games trilogy. Weak character development and unnecessary plot twists caused this book to fall short of its two predecessors. Without giving much of the story-line away, I felt little or nothing when certain characters met their demise due to the lack of prior development, and some aspects of the plot were not vital to the story.
