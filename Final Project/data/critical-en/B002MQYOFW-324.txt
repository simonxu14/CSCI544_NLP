I got tired of the premise about 1/3 of the way through the book and put it down. My main complaint about this book is with e-books in general. They started off as a very economical way to read. Now they cost more than new paperbacks and almost as much as hardcover books. I can buy "like-new" paperbacks from Amazon at about 1/4th the price of an e-book. It appears to me that once the big 3 felt they had a "hooked" audience they increased the price. I paid for this ebook, did not like it and cannot resell it. If I buy a paperback or hardcover I can easily sell it. If I had this knowledge prior to buying an ereader, I would not have bought one. as I read one or two books a month I am going to go back to buying used paperbacks.
