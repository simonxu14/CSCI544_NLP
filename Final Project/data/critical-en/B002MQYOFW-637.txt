I purchased this book for my amazon kindle app on my phone after I watched the latest Mockingjay movie at the theater. I wanted to find out what happens after the movie ended. Overall, I enjoyed reading this last chapter in the series and the book kept my attention till the end. I was kind of surprised at the final battle scene, thinking of a different outcome at Snow's mansion. I am glad that Katniss found some way to keep hope and that her life ended well, even though it was kind of depressing after the final battle scene with the parachutes. I will give it a 3 out of 5 stars.
