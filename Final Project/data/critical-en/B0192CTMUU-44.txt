I disagree with most reviewers here. This book does NOT live up to the legacy set by the other three. I still love Harry Potter, but this book is average compared to the excellence of the others. I kept asking myself,  &quot;Where was the editor?&quot; This book could have easily been cut in  1/2 and been a better read as a result. Themes, descriptions and events  from the previous three books were repeated here unnecessarily. Scenes were  stretched out. Conversations and descriptions lacked the snappy wit we've  come to expect from J.K. Rowling. An issue of slavery was introduced poorly  and then dropped without resolution. The only new &amp; exciting part of  Harry Potter Book IV was the end. It's not easy to keep a long book series  original. J.K. Rowling is very talented, but it turns out she's human, too.  While the first 3 books in the series are masterpieces, book 4 is simply  average. Let's hope she regains the &quot;magic&quot; with the rest of the  series. If not, I'll wait to read her writing again when she begins a new  story - outside of the world of Harry Potter.
