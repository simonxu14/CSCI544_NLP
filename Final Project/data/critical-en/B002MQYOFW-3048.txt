In spite of all the hype and Hollywood success, this is not a book for pre-teens. I recommend that all parents pre-read this trilogy before allowing a younger teen to read it. I personally find nothing entertaining, edifying, enjoyable, or enlightening in a book that glorifies cruelty and torture, in which adults sacrifice children to save themselves, fear and distrust are the prevailing emotions, and parents are weak and unable to care for their children, and the kick-ass heroine's best friend ultimately orchestrates the death of her sister and mother.<br />I wouldn't have like this trilogy as an adult book, as "young adult" fiction it's appalling.
