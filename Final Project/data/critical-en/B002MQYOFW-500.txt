After spending three days doing almost nothing but reading this trilogy, I am completely disappointed in the ending.  It's as if Suzanne Collins was on a slash and burn campaign to destroy every character that we had grown to love.  To top that off, I'm somewhat convinced that she designed her ending with her first priority being maximum shock value.  Obviously, war is ugly, but if I wanted to only feel the brutality of it I'd be watching the news, or reading non-fiction.  **(spoiler alert)**  In the end Katniss is a copy of her comotose mother that her true fiery self so resented in the first book, and ultimately, and you can't help but realize that her personal sacrifice was for nothing since her poor sweet sister just got killed off horrificly with her family watching anyway.  To me, the trilogy was simply ruined when it had true potential for awesomeness.
