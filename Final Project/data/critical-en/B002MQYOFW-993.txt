This third  book of the Hunger Games Series just seemed to drag on and on.  The whole book seemed to be about the big fight at the end.  I thought it boring, lacking any plot, except the fight, and very little cohesiveness to the whole story.  Somewhere, the story got lost in the book.  I really liked the first book, the second seemed to be just a bridge to the third, and i was glad to get to the end of the third book.
