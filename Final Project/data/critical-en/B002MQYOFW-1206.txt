"The Hunger Games" is not the kind of story that will make you ponder deep questions about society or enlighten you to a truth about humanity, but it is an enjoyable story if you are looking for a decent adventure. The characters are a bit one-dimensional and you don't seem to care if they live or die, but they are better than Bella Swan that is for sure! I hope the sequel develops the characters more.
