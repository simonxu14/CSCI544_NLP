I did not like this book.  This is one time I hope that whomever writes the screenplay changes everything that was written in the book.  It was at times so confusing I had to go back and read whole sections over to get what happened. This book felt like an afterthought.  Was it written before the movie deal?  Poor way of storytelling the ravages of war.<br /><br />Key issues<br />* The story sucked...not because of the war put her lame way of telling the war story. Who had any redeeming qualities? No one.  What happened to the characters we rooted for in the first books?<br /><br />* Peeta treatment...really lost the whole essence of the character from the first two books.  Very poor treatment of a main character.<br /><br />*Katniss -souless, dead inside, always someone's pawn<br /><br />*Haymitch - just got lost in the shuffle of this horribly written story<br /><br />*Prim - why bother discussing my issues as the author appeared to just toss her into the ending and gloss over so poorly what she symbolized in this whole trilogy.<br /><br />*Snow - WTH kinda ending was that for him.  Poorly Poorly written<br /><br />I really wish I'd stopped reading after the second book.  Feel cheated by the author<br /><br />So glad I only paid $1.00 using KSO special offers.  It makes up for the time I wasted reading this book.
