I feel betrayed by this book. My daughter and I read and loved and recommended the first two books of the series to many. In our opinion, Suzanne Collins was writing a book about resilience, integrity, leadership and hope. Qualities and ideas we admire. Sure it was set in an oppression setting. Being regular book club readers, we were able to note a connection to real life oppression in certain geographies and time in history. We were willing to leave the pleasure of the book and discuss what we might learn that related to real life.<br /><br />However,the fact that Ms. Collins decided we "needed" a real life lesson in oppression and the emotional and fatal costs of rebellion is beyond insulting. To have lured us in with some high quality morals, riveting challenges and characters we came to truly love, to give us a "good lesson" about the realities of war seems so dishonest, so self-righteous and so without conscience that I am disgusted.<br /><br />We hated this book and reading it ruined everything we loved about the others. Please don't buy this book.
