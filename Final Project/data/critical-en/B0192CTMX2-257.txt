Definitely not in the &#34;Very good&#34; condition as described. Binding was extremely loose, multiple pages were bent and drawn on. The worst of it is there appears to be water damage on the back cover and last 100 pages or so. Definitely not one to keep for my collection, I'll just have to buy another one :(
