This book is competantly written and compares well with most children's books written today. BUT for plot, interesting magical events,  character development, and interesting dialog it cannot compare with E. Nesbit's,  Edward Eager's nor with C.S. Lewis's books! (for example: The Enchanted  Castle by E. Nesbit, Half Magic by Edward Eager, and the Narnia Series by  Lewis.)
