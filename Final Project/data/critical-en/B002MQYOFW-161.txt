Okay so I love this series. It takes you outside the box and makes you face your fears, and even when your broken shows you can still fight.<br /><br />Now let me be honest. As much as I did enjoy the book I finished it feeling very slighted. Throughout the Hunger Games we get the very love story that is Katniss and Peeta. I mean in this book she goes to war for Peeta. The way it ended left a lot to be desired. No build up just bam. Her choice between Gale and Peeta happens and you just kinda sit there like what?<br /><br />But other than that I did seriously enjoy Mockingjay I mean i read it in one sitting and now must face work with only three hours of sleep but hey....this series was amazing.
