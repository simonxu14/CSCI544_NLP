If your teenager is reading this book, please, read this review.<br /><br />It's difficult to write a review without spoilers but I wish I had read something to prepare me for this ending.<br /><br />This book is much darker than the other two.  Although, they all deal with violent material to be discussed with your teenager.  In this final book, I believe that Ms. Collins intentions are fully realized, to make you feel the complete damage that war can do  to a soldier.  The hopelessness that a person can be left with.  Having said that, I know veterans that have come back from war and have made  successful, happy lives.  Many soldiers are able to find happiness again and are able to heal.  This book is not a testimony to that kind of process.  This book takes you on a horrific journey to feel our beloved Mockingjay become a hollow version of herself, climaxing without her ever really growing into a hero with any passion for a cause for freedom,  and then it cuts you off from any kind of a journey of healing.  Mockingjay really feels like a commentary about those soldiers drafted into war by hate, anger, or fear and  that are so damaged  they barely learn to live again, and will never feel joy or peace.  I'm not sure Ms. Collins was trying to make political statements about war, as some have said, but for a teenager to read this without having a balanced discussion about war, could be very easily construed as propaganda.  I recommend you read this book with your child, or in the very least, discuss it with them.  Whatever your views on war, it is an opportunity to have a serious discussion about it.
