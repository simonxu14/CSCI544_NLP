I was really disappointed with this series and found it one dimentional and not worth the hype. I know it's written for teenagers, but I was mostly bored throughout the series wishing to connect with the characters more. There are a lot of great ideas and I wish the author would've gotten into less detail with the characters aquiring food and more on the political plotting and storyline.
