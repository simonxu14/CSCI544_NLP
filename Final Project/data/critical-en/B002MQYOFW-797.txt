Not as good as the first two.  The story dragged a little, and the world just didn't feel as richly developed.  Katniss' role as symbol and hero felt more forced than as a rightful consequence of her actions.  In  addition, many things "somehow" happened, without any explanation.  (How did they get Peeta out?)  It was still a good read, but I did not find it nearly as engrossing as the first two.  I can't award a half star, but I would rate this 3.5 out of 5.
