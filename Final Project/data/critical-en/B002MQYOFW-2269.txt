I Loved the 1st two books sooo much, that is why this book got a 2 star and not a 1 star.<br /><br />Spoilers:<br /><br />1st off..<br />Gale/vs.Petta I see why Gales Character became this guy all about the cause and making sacrifices for the cause, and being upset that katniss was acting cold towards her feelings for him. I hated what the author did too petta but I understand him coming back and hating her, but he works through it and still loves her.  I feel like the obvious reason she choose Peeta is bc she wanted to be the baker/artist wife not the military wife. If you went through two hunger games and a mokingjay do you really want to spend the rest of your life doing military stuff, no. The military life is something Gale wanted more than her even, so I dont think he would give up that life. Also moraly Katniss and Peeta were more alike.<br /><br />On to Katniss..She is sooo hot and cold, mostly cold. She seems like she is not in love with gale or ppetta the whole book. Even though she keeps the pearl on her that is not enough. Like why does she keep thinking it is okay for petta to die  if at the end she marries him and has his babbies and says this is how it always was suppose to be?  I know she voted for the hunger games for the capital kids just so she would be on coins good side. I loved her killing coin like that my fav. part. but couldnt they have also killed snow in a similar way. his death was anticlimatic.<br /><br />I am mad about the killing off of so many ppl, like finnick and prim, I think they were rushed and could have used more detail if they were going to kill them off.<br /><br />Why is the love business not in the book the whole time this squished in the last few pages? I could have used much much much more detail into peeta and katniss and them growing closer again. That made me the maddest.<br /><br />aLSO THE writing style is soo diff. from the 1st two not nessicarily bad, but kind of boring at times. To much details about war stuff, and not enough detail on love stuff.<br /><br />I demand a rewrite and lets pretend this last book didnt happen.
