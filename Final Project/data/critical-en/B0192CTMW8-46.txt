The hardcover book was fine.  However, it was a gift for my grandchild and the sticker information and cost was on the cover and could not be removed without tearing the cover.  I was forced to swap covers with the book i had in my own collection.  The  books really should have a plastic cover that can be removed that will contain this information and not destroy the looks of the cover.
