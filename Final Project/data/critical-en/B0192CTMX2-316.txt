I was very disappointed with this book. Sure, it was good writing and very thrilling, but Harry was not a very nice child in this book. He was disobedient, got away with all his wrong doings and rule breaking and was rude and "cheeky" to his elders. I found that this book had a lot of violence in it: i.e. when he had to write lines and the words were carved into his hands and bleeding and swelling up. I think that this book teaches other kids that it is okay to disobey those in authority and to back-talk your elders. The use of bad language and language that in England is unknown to Americans, but is actual cursing.... very bad cursing, was totally inappropriate and unnecessary. I would not recommend this book to anyone as I found it quite horrid in parts. I am done with this series......
