What a huge waste of my time!  I loved the first and second books, but I really thought that Collins would develop Katniss into someone that could be looked up to, not looked upon with disgust.  Overall I though that Katniss spent more time crying or in the hospital or running away than actually doing anything heroic.  I also feel like at the end, the author got tired of writing and threw a bunch of junk in to "try" and make the book more enthralling.  Well, I will probably never pick up another one of your books.
