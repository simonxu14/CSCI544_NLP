The first two books were more than amazing but do yourself a favor and do not read the last one. The author completely change the theme of the book from the last two. Mokingjay was so bad it ruined the first two books and made them pointless. Do yourself a favor before you buy the hunger games and go to a book store or borrow a copy of Mokingjay and read the last chapter. You will save yourself a lot of time and be glad you did!
