This book shows all the horrors of war and the aftermath (PTSD). It presents the victors as normal, vulnerable people. Katniss is especially presented as a deranged, broken girl.<br /><br />It felt like the storyline was carrying the characters, and not the other way around. Our beloved characters, Katniss and Peeta, were just pulled around by the plot. They didn't make as many decisions, and there wasn't much character development for these two either.<br /><br />The love triangle felt like an afterthought, as if the author just stuck it in there because she was forced to. There was little development or explaining on how Peeta gradually got weaned off the capitol's control on his mind, and there were only a few romantic moments between Peeta and Katniss (2-3 paragraphs at most). The author also doesn't bother to indulge us on what happened to the two after Coin's assassination. She just summarizes their relationship in 1 paragraph. You'd think that after all that happened in the first 2 volumes, they deserve a little more screen time.<br /><br />And although the book had a lot of GalexKatniss moments, the author clearly had no idea how to get Gale out of the picture. And so she solves her problem with a deux ex machina: she kills off Prim, using technology that Gale helped developed. Now whenever Katniss sees Gale, she thinks of how her sister died (the author says in ~2 lines). Yay for the author, now she got Gale out of the picture. Then she promptly hooks her up with Peeta in 1 paragraph. Yay, love triangle solved.<br /><br />I know the story is about war, but the romance just felt too much like an afterthought.
