I read these after my kids did and was enthralled by the stories. I'll simply reiterate what others have said in that the ending was too predictable and formulary. As a closing to a great series, it was lacking.<br /><br />I almost didn't purchase this after reading the reviews, but I had to have closure ;)  I'd buy it again (I got it on Kindle), but wouldn't buy it in hardback as it isn't one I'll read more than once.
