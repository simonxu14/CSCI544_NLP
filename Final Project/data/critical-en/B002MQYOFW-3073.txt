Following on the heels of the intensely popular "Hunger Games" and "Catching Fire," many fans waited anxiously for the third installment of this intensely exciting series, only to be vastly disappointed.  "Mockingjay," while providing the return of familiar characters, becomes more of a political commentary than a gripping story.  The level of writing does not compare to the rich detail of the first novel, and does not provide the same "edge of your seat" excitement.  This fan wishes Collins would have taken the extra time and made us wait for a novel that was better thought out, instead of rushed to print.
