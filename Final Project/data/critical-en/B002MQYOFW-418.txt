Thought I ought to read this since everyone else has.  Books were just okay, but I've read worse.<br /><br />I had to wonder how a society that possessed stealth technology, aircraft cloaking devices, and was capable of manipulating DNA was still dependent on coal.  The overall plot was fairly easy to figure out in advance, and the characters were pretty shallow; but I guess that is to be expected when one reads "young adult" literature or watches network TV.<br /><br />The Hunger Games was fairly good, Catching Fire was a little better, but I had to force myself to read the last 100 pages of Mockingjay; trilogies are tough; by the third one everybody is getting tired of the story, even the author.  Star Wars, of course, is the exception.
