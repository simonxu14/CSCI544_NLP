I have posted individual book reviews for each book in the trilogy.  The Hunger Games 5 stars, Catching Fire 3 stars, and Mockingjay 2 stars.<br /><br />This review is for the set.  I'm giving this set 3 stars because I don't recommend you buy all three books.  I personally only recommend The Hunger Games, and maybe the first half of Catching Fire (up top the point they start the games in that book).  If you want to know what happens after that, look it up or ask someone who read it.  The third book is not well written nor a logical, probable, or fulfilling conclusion to the series.
