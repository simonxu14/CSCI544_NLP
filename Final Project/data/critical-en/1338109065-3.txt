A very interesting story, I will buy the DVD. The format of this book is very difficult to take; but I also had a hard time with Shakespeare. I got 3/4 of the way through Harry Potter and the Cursed Child; then skipped to the end and read the last few pages.  Great story, but the format Screen Play killed it for me.  When I saw that this book was also a screen play I just put it on my book shelf and never read it. J.K. Rowling is a great author, I lover her novels.  I like the tales in her current books; just can not deal with the format.  5 Stars for story, 1/2 Star for format.
