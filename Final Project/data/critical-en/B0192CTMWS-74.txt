I was disappointed in how much time JKR spent developing the new character, the predictably bad Defense against the Dark Arts professor.  I thought the climax was hastily rushed through and lacked the depth of her earlier books.  I enjoyed the vivid writing throughout - and it's fun to see Harry continue his quest, even if some of the path's seem a bit too well worn and predictable.  Not a bad book, but not quite on par with the first 4.
