That doesn't mean it wasn't done well.  This is a cheesy teenage love story written in an apocalyptic back drop to make it more interesting.  It's a genius idea, although I hear the concept has been done before.  I read it because I was fascinated by the apocalyptic back story.  I kept reading it because of the interesting characters and character development.  It's fast paced.  The writing style is simple and juvenile.  How many different excuses can the games find to make them kiss?  C'mon, was this written by a teenage girl?
