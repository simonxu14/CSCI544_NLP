This is the last in the series of Hunger Games books and I find it just gets too political and too focused on the same idea, which was exciting in the first and second book but by this book I find it falls very flat.  I also found that Katniss seems to be always getting injured and by this stage its boring!  She gets patched up and moved through hospital again and again and doesn't seem to achieve anything.  Also, by the end of the book it seems to have gotten to the writer too who seems to all of sudden reach a certain amount of words and then up and leaves, tying all the ends of the tale together, too quickly and too fast without really thinking about the tone and the attitude of the original two books.  A sad finish to a great start.
