I have to say the first two books were amazing however, the last book was just a big mess, the first two books I read very quickly but this one it tooked me like 2 months because there was really nothing exciting going on. I think Suzanne Collins could have done better or even make a 4th book if that was case to make it more exciting. This book was just like the movie soo much expectations and what a huge disappointment.......
