All of a s-s-sudden many of the  P-p-potter characters have d-d-developed a stuttering problem. Especially the women.  Is this the result of some sinister curse we weren't told about?<br />  Harry's  NUMEROUS CAPITAL-LETTER TANTRUMS!! quickly become tiresome. Supposedly he throws  these constant fits because he's now an adolescent. Well, so are Ron and Hermione, and they  don't spend all their time shrieking in upper case.<br />  Yes, Harry has a tough life and he's persecuted and misunderstood. But the extreme personality change is bizarre. Harry has become not likable .<br />  It seems this adolescent illness has affected only Harry and Cho Chang.  Cho now whines a lot and has fallen under the dreaded stuttering curse.<br /> We had been  warned that an important character was going to be killed off in this book, and I was as curious as anyone else. By the time it happened, I didn't  care. The ending felt rushed and anticlimactic.<br />  Professor Grinning Toad Umbridge was too utterly awful to be entertaining. Snape is cruel and evil too, but he's complicated, mysterious and therefore interesting.<br /> Hagrid's reason for being absent was unbelievably hokey and didn't  fit  with the plot. Maybe it will be revelant at some point.<br />  One of the most cringe-producing parts of the story involves a  character being injured, which causes a speech impediment that  drags on for several pages. The first couple of "Stubefies!" were mildly amusing.  After that it god weally stubid.<br />  Despite all my complaints, I read the whole 800-plus pages. Parts of it are captivating. But overall, "Order of the Phoenix" was  disappointing. I hope the next one is better.
