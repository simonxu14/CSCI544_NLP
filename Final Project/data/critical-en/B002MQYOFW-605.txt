I paid 5 bucks for the Kindle version of The Hunger Games trilogy. I don't feel I wasted my money. I probably wouldn't have bought the books if it hadn't been for the $5 deal, plus I kinda wanted to see what the Movie left out. I am curious how they do on the next 2 movies now.<br /><br />Good read, wished there was some more description in places. At times the narrative feels rushed, and events are skipped with no explanation, but for a quick read it isn't bad.
