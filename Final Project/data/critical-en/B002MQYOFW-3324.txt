So like the rest of the fans of the Hunger Games series, I came into reading Mockingjay after I have read the original Hunger Games and Catching Fire. And I have to say that the final installment of the series was a serious disappointed. I was surprised by Collins' lack of in depth detail that made the two of the previous books vivid and captivating in this book. I was debating whether or not to read this book, because such well written book series usually have letdown finales, this one being no exception. The ending does not allow you to draw the future of Katniss and other characters because of its sense of finale, but is ambiguous enough to make you think, "what just happened and why?"<br /><br />In conclusion, if you're the type that enjoys continue a series' characters alone, DO NOT read this book. It will let you down.
