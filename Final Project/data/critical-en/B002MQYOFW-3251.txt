My daughters-in-law and my grandchildren have all read this trilogy, and recommended it to me.  I made it through the first book and half of the 2nd book, but finally today, I quit reading it.  I can find nothing inspiring or redeeming in this series, and the main plot line of young people being selected for the Hunger Games, wherein they are all trying to kill each other, was disgusting and disturbing.  Thousands of Amazon reviewers have given it 5 stars, which is beyond me.  The writing is certainly nothing extraordinary, and the characters, for the most part, are unlikable (or dead!)  Some reviewers have compared this series to Harry Potter or the Millenium trilogy.  I read all of those, and found them to be amazing.  This series I found to be pointless and very unredeeming.  I don't like to think that my grandkids read these, and in fact, are already making plans to go to the midnight screening when the movie opens.
