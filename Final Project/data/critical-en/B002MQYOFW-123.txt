[No Spoilers] If you were thirsting after a satisfying and riveting finale to the Hunger Games trilogy with Mockingjay, then be prepared to continue to go hungry. Quite frankly, in this third book, Ms. Collins is the one who appears to have been brainwashed and made to forget the true essence of her first books and painfully abandon the characters she made us fall in love with. Our beloved heroine, Katniss, was demoted to a frail victim of her circumstances. What made Hunger Games so great was it's consistent theme that although Katniss was a pawn and a victim of a totalitarian government, her intuitiveness and innate sense of justice always lead her to rise above it all. She was able to win, against all odds, and that's why all of Panem, along with us readers, rallied behind her. So it was a natural expectation that in Mockingjay those qualities would be further explored and lead her to rise even more, to gain confidence in her gift for knowing the right thing to do and to grow as a character. Instead she is made into a kill-joy and not only her but ALL of the other characters as well, the exception being Finnick and really the only reason this rating earned 2 stars and not one.<br /><br />I think the positive reviewers have rebutted that the Mockingjay was true to the reality of what happens to those exposed to War but have they forgotten that the Hunger Games was fake? It was a made up fantasy world and therefore the third installment of the trilogy did not HAVE to realistically depict the emotional consequences of a war-ravaged soul. Did Ms. Collins forget her audience was "Young Adult"? That means preteens, teens and adults willing to be whisked away into a world of fantasy, justice and young love. Perhaps some silly focus group along the way told her to write Book 3 to the Video Game addicted 13 year old boy and just blow up everything in sight...they don't really want to read about friendships, relationships, or rich characters with clever voices, make sure to write about weapons a lot!!<br /><br />Another one of Ms. Collin's failures of Mockingjay was the constant repetitiveness throughout. Catching Fire fell victim to this also but by Mockingjay, it was ridiculous. Exactly how many times did the author make use of the Copy and Paste commands because just so many details of the book were ones that had already been explained numerous times before. I practically have the words to the silly Hanging Tree song memorized! If your readers are loyal then they don't need to be told again and again basics about the world of the Hunger Games. A little echoing and reflection is acceptable but when the reader finds themselves skipping over lines to get back on track with the storyline then you have failed.<br /><br />Mockingjay was also a joke when it came to the "Reality TV" spin on things. In Hunger Games and Catching Fire, I bought the whole Reality-TV-to-the-Extreme storyline completely but in Mockingjay when a full on war is being waged, giving so much of the story to the behind the scenes camera nonsense seemed to actually be mocking the original book. I couldn't take the war seriously since I was trying to be convinced that Katniss was now a pseudo-actress! I'd sooner believe taking Paris Hilton and making her the face of Occupy Wall Street! It was soooo contrived, it actually made me winch while reading and it was more annoying that the cameras were such a star of the book well until the end.<br /><br />[SPOILERS AHEAD]<br />Mockingjay Character fails:<br /><br />Katniss - as I mentioned above we fell in love with Katniss for a reason. We were given and inside view of how her mind worked, how she intuitively was able to survive based on her hunter's instincts that kept her one step ahead of the enemy. She was gutsy, beautiful yet humble. The Mockingjay version of Katniss made her wimpy, very self-absorbed with little regard for those she cared about and a whiny victim, to boot! Who'd want to be friends with her? Why not allow her to mature, time could have passed another year or two when an 18-19 yr old is truly coming to know themselves. Katniss could have realized that she really was capable of being a leader, she could have had more drive and instinct to successfully lead the rebels. Instead she was basically either a hospital patient, a depressed recluse, a failed actress or a Rambo warrior. Completely inconsistent with the Katniss we knew from Hunger Games. I miss the real Katniss and was annoyed at how she was changed so drastically in Mockingjay.<br /><br />Gale - Gale was never given a fair shot in any of the books. I fully expected Catching Fire to explore the Gale/Katniss relationship, and then Book 3 to have us on edge about the love triangle. Instead Gale was left in the peripheral of the entirety of the Hunger Games and only allowed to swoop in and save Katniss or her family from peril whenever Katniss failed or was unable to do it herself. Catching Fire hinted at their underlying love for each other but by Mockingjay it fizzled and no...it didn't "catch fire!" The poor guy was made into nothing more than a gun-slinging war strategist in Mockingjay. I guess he was smart though when he said "Katniss will choose whoever she thinks she can't survive without." By then I think we all agreed with the spitefulness in that statement.<br /><br />Peeta - Poor guy, always the softy, always the gentleman, always the one willing to be the martyr. And yet the sweet gallant painter was turned into a tortured killing mutt! Really? For the last two books the author has been hinting at how he's willing to die for Katniss...like what a million times? So why not let him just plain DIE for Katniss?!?! Let him be the ultimate hero, not turn him into a mess of a person that just gets to fade away into the sunset baking and holding onto his mind for dear life! That's no life.<br /><br />Prim - I was happy to see Prim mature a bit, we did get to experience who Prim was a little, for a very brief moment. And we did get to dream for a happy future for her without Hunger Games but then I hope you didn't blink because you may have missed the part where she gets blown into smithereens! That's it, nice knowing you! The author seems to have forgotten what Prim represented in Book 1 - she was the hope, the future, she was the one to protect, to fight for...she represented all of the children of Panem who were victims of the Hunger Games. If the point of the trilogy was to put an end to the Hunger Games then why, oh why, end it with killing off the one character that represented freedom from the Hunger Games! Killing off Prim now made everything else that Katniss ever did pointless. If she couldn't save Prim then what was the point?<br /><br />Katniss's Mom - Hello? Mom, are you there? She was in Book 3, right? Hmmm, I think the author kind of forgot about her. Oh well, who needs a mother when District 3 has a new nurse instead?<br /><br />Haymitch - Who would have wanted to see this brilliant but weak mentor and mastermind grow out of his dependency to the bottle and to have him had played a pivotal role as a political leader of the rebellion? Wouldn't it have been nice to see Haymitch's smarts be put to good use. Instead he too takes a backseat to the convoluted storyline of Mockingjay and also gets to fade away pointlessly into nothing, no longer anybody's mentor and basically with a lot more reasons to drink himself into oblivion!<br /><br />President Snow - Exactly what made him so evil? We never get to find out. Do we get to experience revenge for all of the treacherous acts he's done to the people of Panem? Well I guess if you count sitting him in a pretty garden and then watching him cough himself to death..or was he stepped on to death?...anyway, if you think that is satisfying vengeance then yep, I guess it counts! Bad, bad conclusion to this character, such a let down.<br /><br />President Coin - I kept picturing Hilary Clinton for some reason or maybe I simply had to invent my own character version of her because there was so little to go on from the book. Kind of pointless character really. I expected the leader of District 13 to be someone respectable, honorable, not just a me-too President Snow. Why introduce another unlikeable enemy, we already had Snow and even he was underdeveloped.<br /><br />Finnick - I left my favorite for last, yes the only ray of sunshine in Mockingjay was Finnick. He was the Rue of Mockingjay, the one that helped Katniss and he had an interesting backstory. He was the one you rooted for to find love and hoped for recompense for what he suffered at the mercy of Snow. He was a true friend and the only character to be somewhat developed from the previous book but alas, he was not given a graceful demise like Rue. Nope, bring in the lizard mutts and quick before the reader realizes it make sure he just gets pinched off! Can I say the word "pointless" again?! I had to reread it and then I just kept asking "what?" over and over.<br /><br />52 Leegs Dead and Gone - yep that was basically the name for all of the other miscellaneous characters in this book. Boogs, Pularch,the camera guys, the other sharp shooters, the shrink, the other victors. Really nothing but collateral damage, both of the war and of this book! To think the real character development we could have experienced if we weren't caught up in keeping track of Who's Who of District 13!<br /><br />It's just a shame that readers were so invested in the Hunger Games. You had us, Ms. Collins, and yet after we bought all three of your books your finale did nothing but made us feel like we too were at the mercy of the Capitol. Now I know what it's like to be a pawn of the Hunger Games. You used the Mockingjay as a propaganda for the sale of your books rather than committing to your art.
