The book is ok but not what I expected.  It was sufficiently interesting for me to finish it within 24 hours but I just don't see what the hype is about.  The writing style is pretty simple, enough for kids to be able to read.  It's also not anywhere near as brutal as I expected from the hype.  It's no more violent than Harry Potter or LOTR.  It had a couple of strong emotional moments for me but nothing close to what I've experienced in other books in the sci-fi/fantasy genre.<br /><br />Overall I'll give it 3 stars.  It was worth a read but was only average entertainment value.  I was disappointed enough that I don't plan on reading the other two books in the series.  Disclaimer: I haven't seen the movie either.
