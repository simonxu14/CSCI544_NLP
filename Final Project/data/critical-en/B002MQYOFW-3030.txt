You know that point in a school paper where the student stops caring so much about the quality of the paper and just wants to fill the pages to get it finished? That's what many parts of The Hunger Games felt like to me. I was continually surprised and disappointed how little detail and description was given to important events and characters. I downloaded the Kindle sample chapters of the second book but really don't have much desire to read it.
