When I received this book in the mail, the front cover/jacket was bent and had little rips along the top and bottom. I was pretty disappointed as it was a gift for my boyfriend. Luckily, he had this book at one point and lent it to someone, but kept the jacket of it. We swapped out the jackets of the books. However, I am disappointed with my order because it said it was &#34;Brand New&#34;; I wouldn't have purchased it otherwise. Not entirely happy with this order, although the shipping was very fast. I tried writing a review on this a while ago when I first got my order, guess it never went through.
