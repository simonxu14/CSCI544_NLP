I enjoyed the story enough to download the next two.  However, it took awhile to get past the first person POV.  It's just weird to say "I carry the stick..." rather than "I carried the stick..."  Very, very strange way to write this story.  Had it been done in 3rd person, it would have been a great improvement.  Otherwise, it's a good story line I just wish it had been written by someone like Koontz who could have given it meat.
