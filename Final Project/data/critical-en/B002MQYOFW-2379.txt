I bought The Hunger Games trilogy box set because I've been hearing about the series for a long time now and REALLY wanted to read it. I decided I couldn't wait for the third book to come out in paperback and, since I like my series to be alike hardback/paperback-wise, purchased this set.<br /><br />It surprised me by arriving very quickly but, as I took the books out of the decorative cardboard box to see the covers I received another, less thrilling, surprise. The third book in the series had several pages that were bent and smashed into each other. I have nothing against general wear and tear from used book purchases or from books I've bought and read so often - things happen. BUT this is a brand new item, and I expect the product to be in perfect condition.<br /><br />After looking closely at the decorative box that holds the 3 books, I saw that the cardboard back was folded and tucked in on the side where the third book rested. When the book was placed in the box, the tucked in edge went INSIDE of the book rather than TO THE SIDE of the book. I do realize this means the bent pages are not Amazon's fault but rather a design flaw in the packaging and carelessness by the packager/packaging system, but I just warn everyone looking at this item that this is the possible condition in which your book(s) will arrive.<br /><br />P.S. - The pages were bent back almost in place by manually straightening them and then keeping pressure on the correctly closed book for a few days. I am keeping the set, and have already enjoyed reading it in its entirety.
