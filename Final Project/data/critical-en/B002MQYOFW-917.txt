I loved the first book, but by this book I was kind of over the idea of the Hunger Games. I felt like this story dragged on and could have been condensed. It was hard to focus as well because I felt like the story was all over the place. I am looking forward to watching the movie, however. I feel like it will summarize it nicely. One positive note is that I really liked how it ended.
