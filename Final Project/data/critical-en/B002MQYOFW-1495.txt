**spoiler alert** I have to admit that I was left feeling depressed after reading this book. I was utterly taken aback with the many flaws in the writing and the utter lack of growth by the main character. I found myself wanting to run off in tears, find a closet to hide in, berry myself in satin clothes and drift off into oblivion.<br /><br />Mockingjay mocks the first and even the second book before it. Katniss who enters our lives as a lion, ends up leaving like a lamb. She is so caught up in self-pity that I couldn't help wanting to slap her all the way through the book. There are a few times that I am impressed and a hope rises up that the book will turn for the better; I'm utterly crushed again when it doesn't.<br /><br />Through the first two books we are introduced to and then captivated by a strong willed young woman who was forced to grow up too fast. Instead of wallowing in self-pity, she stands tall and exceeds what is expected of her. She survives whatever the cost. We arrive at the third book and instead of that character who stood tall, we get a character who took the opposite path from the very beginning. We get a loser who can't stand up at all and who does nothing but cry and snivel. Katniss grows to just be cut down in a few fell pages, as if nothing over the last two books ever happened.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins dropped the ball. This whole book is rushed and the story jumps so fast that more than half of the action is told in retrospect in one or two sentences. I also noticed that it is the same book as the first two, just terribly written. Characters are given time on the pages and then seem to fall off, just to arise again with little or no context. Other characters are given time, but not enough before they are violently killed. Again this action takes place after the fact in one to two short sentences.<br /><br />Peeta gives Katniss a Pearl in the second book. After Peeta is captured and brain washed, I couldn't help but think that the pearl would play and instrumental role in bringing him back from his brain washed madness. Katniss carries the Pearl with her through the whole book and uses it as a way to remember Peeta as he once was. The Pearl becomes important however, it's dropped and is never brought up again about 2/3rds through the book.<br /><br />Katniss continues to be undecided as to who she loves and plays her games with both Gale and Peeta. However I couldn't help but feel that Gale made up his mind and in the end, it was his decision that put Peeta with Katniss. Katniss never has to decide between the two. Katniss fights the whole time to free herself of being a pawn for the sadistic Capitol, yet in the end, she is just that, a pawn who never makes her own decisions. Utter Rubish.<br /><br />The last few pages try to push the reader over the edge by depicting an act of epic evilness. I felt nothing. Well, maybe a twinge of emotion, but nothing that elicited the emotion that the first book was able to coax out of me. The whole book is this way. Characters are killed and instead of feeling for them, I find that I don't care. The only character that I cared for was Finnick. His death was marred by horrible writing and I ended up feeling swindled and angry rather than remorse and sorrow.<br /><br />Now that I'm done with the Hunger Games trilogy I do not hate this book. I'm glad for the closure however bitterly ruined it might be. I highly recommend the first two books, the first being the highest as all I've learned and loved from the series happens there.
