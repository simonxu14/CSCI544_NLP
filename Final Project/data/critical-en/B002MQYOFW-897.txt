If you have read the previous books by Susan Collins', &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; and &#34;Catching Fire&#34;, and was affected by the drama, action, the struggle between good and evil, the dynamics of human relationships, and the traumatic wounds of of war, you will not be disappointed on those counts by reading &#34;Mockingjay.&#34; This capstone of the trilogy, however, left me with a sense of having been rushed-through the final events of the story. It seems as if the author either did not feel confident about how to bring it to a close in a manner satisfying for the reader and herself, or the press of some personal life-stressor or the publisher forced her hand to close &#34;Mockingjay&#34; prematurely. Altogether a good read, just good-enough.
