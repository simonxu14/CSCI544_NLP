Everything about this book, this trilogy, moved me profoundly. It was an emotional roller coaster to watch sixteen year old Katniss fight her way to victory in two Hunger Games, experience astonishing loss, and become a symbol of the rebel fire to overthrow oppressive rule in order to create a new world.<br /><br />Mockingjay perfectly match the brilliant pacing and plotting of The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. Like the first two, Mockigjay is full of action, suspense, and wonderful characterization. These elements weave a great tale that makes the reader stop and consider the world through the eyes of sixteen year old Katniss Everdeen.<br /><br />Katniss was introduced as is a strong and resourceful survivor who learned how to persevere in a very harsh environment. Following her victory in the arena and as she was forced into the role of both symbol and pawn for others to use for their own objectives, she still retained a semblance of control.<br /><br />In Mockingjay, Katniss had become more angsty, sad, and angry as she experiences even more tragic hardships but though all her trials, she maintains her core as the girl from the Hunger Games who had to keep her family alive since the age of twelve.<br /><br />The post-traumatic stress, the mental breakdowns, and near insanity that beset Katniss were all played out realistically. It was a testament to Collins for not falling back on the gimmick of the tramatized heroine becoming an omnipotent uber woman who conquers the world. Katniss is depicted as an adolescent already damaged by hunger, violence and oppression when she is thrown into center of political intrigue and deception.<br /><br />I loved learning more in depth insight into the wonderful secondary characters as Finnick, Annie, Boggs, Johanna, and Katniss' team.<br /><br />This novel was so incredibly moving; it was a crucible of sad and sweet, pain and healing that sometime left me physically drained. There were times I had to set the book down and reset in order to get through certain parts. Collins could really build up love and connection for a character...then just as suddenly tear them away.<br /><br />It was devastating become attached to so many extraordinary characters, who were symbols of hope and happiness for the future, only to extinguish their light in the next chapter. Such inexplicable deaths of certain characters just left me with a feeling of emptiness.<br /><br />As for the love triangle, the whole Team Gale/Team Peeta dilemma merely comes across as a distraction, especially when there is a much greater plot present. Gale and Peeta are exemplary in their own right. Gale the hunter is strong, resilient, and resourceful. Peeta, the boy with the bread, is sweet, sincere, and devoted.  Both possessed fine qualities that were in perfect sync with Katniss, however, a triangle is an impossible situation and the only resolution is that one character will be shortchanged, discarded, or hurt.<br /><br />Overall, The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and  Mockingjay combined is one of the most memorable and moving trilogies I've ever had the pleasure of reading. The girl who was on fire captured a piece of my heart.
