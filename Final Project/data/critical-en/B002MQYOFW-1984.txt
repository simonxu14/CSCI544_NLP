I loved the first two books, because the were just pure and simply good reads. In the Mockingjay I just feel as if there were way to many missed opportunities, by the author, to bring the readers emotions into play. After spending two days reading the book, and three days reading the reviews, (some of the chapters in the book are shorter than many of the reviews. To funny) I simply want to say that with all the deaths that took place in this last book, there were just to many missed opportunities with bringing the reader in emotionally. This was not a bad book, but I probably would not have chosen to finish it, had I not read the first two.
