This is a book and story for teens.  It has a mild love story, with no sexuality.  However, the idea of a government using children to fight to the death, was  quite disturbing.  I feel the reason it is so popular is because it stresses mans constant search to make a better situation out of an impossible one.  I will not be buying the rest of the trilogy.
