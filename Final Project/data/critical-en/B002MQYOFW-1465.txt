I read the whole trilogy in a few days and, like everyone else has said, I loved the first two books. But with Mockingjay, I kept thinking to myself, "Is this even the same author?" If, in the future, it's revealed that this last book was ghostwritten, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised. Just a completely different feel than the others. It almost felt like Collins was just trying to get this all over with in a hurry. When I finished Mockingjay, I put it down and just sat there for a while, stunned. "That's it? That's how she's going to end all this?" Felt kinda cheated. After this finale I almost wish I had never picked up the books to start with. Depressing. Hopeless. But maybe that's the reaction Collins was trying to elicit.
