My daughter loves these books she has got them from the library several times so for Christmas I wanted to get her a hardcover set of her own. In the title of this item it reads &#34;[Hardcover]&#34; but the books I received were softcover in a very flimsy box.. I'm sure the box won't last long I don't think it would even be very sturdy free standing.. I'm sad that my daughter won't be receiving this item for Christmas as I will be returning it so that I can get her a nicer set. Very disappointed to have been misled by title.
