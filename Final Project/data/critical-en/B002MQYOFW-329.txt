Sadly it appears Collins really does not know how to write sequels.  The first book was great, but it's all downhill from there.<br /><br />The problems are so numerous it's hard to know where to begin.  The biggest is that Katniss never does anything of significance or participates in an operation of military value.  Literally her only job is looking good in front of cameras.  Whenever they send her anywhere near a combat zone, it always goes something like this:  Katniss does some scene for the cameras, a battle breaks out, she disregards orders and endangers everyone around her, then gets injured and wakes up in a hospital bed.  That's it.  Just the same process over and over.<br /><br />It's not until the last quarter of the book when she partakes in an actual operation, and even then it's against orders and ultimately pointless.  Really I was wondering why they needed her at all.<br /><br />That brings up another issue.  The capitol falls way too easily.  Roughly halfway through the book, it's clear that the defeat of the capitol is already a forgone conclusion.  This was the same capitol that kept district 13 in check and a stranglehold over the twelve others for the last 75 years?  Unbelievable!  There is no way they should go down so easily.  They really felt like the underdogs and I often found myself rooting for them.<br /><br />Not only that, but the major thing that prevented the capitol and 13 from fighting in the past, the fact that both sides have nuclear weapons, is completely disregarded for no reason.  Both sides attack each other without worrying about this at all, and without considering using them.  It just makes no sense.<br /><br />And where on earth is the character development?  Katniss is still the scared little teen she was in the first book, always doubting her own abilities and expecting to die at every moment.  She's still only good at hunting and archery.  Nothing else.  She's still way too overly emotional and more then once suffers a mental breakdown, resulting in her being sedated.  This made sense before she went through the Hunger Games, but not anymore.  She should be a hardened, disciplined warrior who understands the realities of the world.<br /><br />Finally, the writing is downright lazy in a lot of areas.  Collins clearly isn't good at writing military matters.  For example, whenever talking firearms, she always uses the term "gun" and nothing else.  No descriptions.  Katniss' bow is described in major detail, why not give the same treatment when she finally learns to use modern weaponry?  What kind of gun is it?  Pistol, rifle, submachine gun, futuristic death ray?  We should know these things.<br /><br />Despite some good action scenes later on and some excellent portrayals of the brutality of war, Mockingjay simple does not work in the end.
