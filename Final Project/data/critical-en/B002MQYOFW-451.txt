This story was so bad that I was expecting "The One Ring" to show up on Katniss's finger to explain her behavior.  When you find yourself rooting for the capital citizens and the peacekeepers to kill off the main character then maybe there's something wrong with the novel.  I felt like action was being put into the novel to fill up pages.  Deaths became meaningless, just more pages to fill.  The heart and soul in The Hunger Games was completely vaporized in Mockingjay.  I feel like the author made her money on the first novel and just threw words together for the conclusion.<br /><br />The only plus I can add is that I would like to see a novel on Beetee and how he won his Hunger Game.
