When you start a book that involves a challenge with only one survivor -  and write it in the first person, then the result is somewhat given away at the start.<br /><br />First person writing also (in this case) hinders character development.  We get the &#34;hero&#34; character, but others are seen through her eyes, and somewhat shallow.<br /><br />The book has twists (good) and was an easy read (time to finish was short) but was not the epic that was expected from its hype. Rather shallow.
