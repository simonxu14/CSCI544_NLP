Bought one book and the binding fell apart as I took it out of the Amazon packaging.  Returned it for another.  My child loves it, but the binding fell apart almost immediately after we got that one as well.  It has been repeatedly taped back together.  My 10 year old is very careful with her books, and this is the only one in her collection that fell apart like this.
