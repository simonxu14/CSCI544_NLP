I loved The Hunger Games. I also really liked Catching Fire -- it started out a bit slower than its predecessor, but really picked up in the final third. In general, it served as both an echo and an expansion of what made The Hunger Games so exciting. I had high hopes for Mockingjay. Disappointed. The book was rushed, ending was rushed. There was no real reason behind any of the events in the second half of the book. It has lost its originality and emotion. Suzanne collins rushed the conclusion of the book and we don't even get to really find out what happened to other characters or why.
