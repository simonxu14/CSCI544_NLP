After finishing this fifth book in the series, I went back and re-read a couple chapters from the first two. The contrast was striking.<br />The earlier books were deftly written, witty and entertaining, bouncing easily from sentence to paragraph to chapter. If you've forgotten the feel, go back and read the first  descriptions of Duddly and his parents.<br />In contrast, this book is labored and long. It has the feel of a book that was far too long in the making, and where the fame of the author has inhibited the work of her editors. It plods along. There is still the hint of the earlier playfulness - as with the figures in portraits moving from frame to frame and commenting on the proceedings - but the playfulness is outweighed by the author's heavy hand moving characters from place to place and scene to scene. She might as well be stage-directing them.<br />It was a long read and not a very entertaining or exciting one. And perhaps most telling, when you reach the last page you do not know the characters better than you did in the beginning. Harry, especially, is almost wholly lifeless in this rendition, despite having been described ad nauseum for nearly 900 pages.
