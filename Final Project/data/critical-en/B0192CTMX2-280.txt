I bought this to complete my daughter's set, she loves the books but doesn't have this one, the others are from her grandmother and were first editions, with slip covers. This binding is done in a new way, it didn't look very good, smller size compared to the other hardbound volumes. I returned it and searched for a first American edition, to match what she has .
