It's a good-to-read fairy tale, but too naive to be convincing.<br /><br />It was interesting to follow character developments. Except when it turned exclusively into scrambling in the mental problems again and again. Especially in this last book it became very difficult to follow.<br /><br />What was bugging me in particular through all three books, is how brutal dictatorship is so easily combined with a tremendous freedom of speech. They show live TV footage and interviews!!! They allow to use their own channels to show adversary propaganda (instead of just switching everything off immediately, which they can). This is something no real dictatorship ever does. Check the Soviet Union -- even though it was much less brutal to most of its citizens, there was no such nonsense as live TV programs, everything was recorded and edited and censored.<br /><br />So the author shows how to defeat a powerful dictatorship by being brave in the cameras.<br />Would be great if it had any relation to the real world.<br /><br />Another thing which looks a gross simplification to me, is the message that ordinary people are good, it's the bad leaders who make whole country's life miserable. Just kill the bad leaders with your arrow, and everything will be good.<br />Best known counter-example is WWII, where a lot of people eagerly took excuse given by Hitler to murder their neighbors. Or Californians eagerly getting rid of their neighbors of Japanese origin.<br /><br />== some spoiler content follows ==<br /><br />Regarding the story flow, it was mostly fine, but spotted with loose ends. First book: they destroy food supply of the Careers, but what effect did it have....? The raid to kill Snow... Effect of her "MockingJay" performances -- stated, but not really felt, thus remaining abstract.<br />"The Hanging Tree" story looked as a raw draft forgotten in the book, with very long but still confusing explanations (I would just leave the poetry, explanations only killed all the charm).
