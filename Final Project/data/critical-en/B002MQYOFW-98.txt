One of the most anticipated and disappointing books I've read all year.  The last volume of The Hunger Games trilogy fails to deliver on the promise of the first two volumes.  What started strong with "The Hunger Games" runs out of creative steam here.  The triangle between Katniss, Peeta, and Gale disappoints, and the ending of the story was flat, clich&eacute;d, and generally unfulfilling.  Read the series - but read it for the first two volumes.  Evidently it is far easier to start a high concept story than it is to end a high concept story.
