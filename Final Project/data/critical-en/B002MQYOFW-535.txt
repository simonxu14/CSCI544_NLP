I love the series , but to me mockingjay was really drug out. I mean I was eagerly turning every page but the more I did the more confused I got on why suddenly the book was leaving me feel a little unsatisfied. I understand that katniss has major ptsd and issues ,but her character is practically unrecognizable. For one thing all the love she seemed to internally feel for peeta  suddenly goes out the window when he turns up hijacked and she actually has to be there for him on an emotional level ,she can't do it. All the while still making out with Gale confusing the he'll out of both. Also she becomes cold I understand with depression u can get that way ,but she still had family and friends. gales family,peeta,her mom and sister  that all love her ,but everyone else has lost everyone peeta and haymitch.  Also was very slow in the beginning then went really fast at the end. And even though I love peeta and katniss. Mostly because of the connection I saw on screen and from the first two books, but in the epilogue it seems that katniss settles for peeta. Gale basically killed prim in her  mind and so peeta was the only one left. I guess Haymitch  was right she could live a hundred lifetimes and never deserve Peers  Mellark!
