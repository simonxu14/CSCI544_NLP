I really found myself struggling to get through this book.  I enjoyed the first book in the trilogy, but found the last two (this one included) to be a little slow.  There were many times reading this book that I felt as though I was trying to rush through to hopefully get to some more exciting part (that never really came).  I feel like the author had an interesting idea with the Hunger Games, but sort of ran out of steam in the subsequent books and didn't know quite where to go with the story.  I couldn't say I recommend this book, but I do look forward to seeing the movie adaptations.
