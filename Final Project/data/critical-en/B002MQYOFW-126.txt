Firstly, if you haven't read the first two novels in the trilogy, please do. Unlike some others, these really need to be read in order.<br /><br />That said, I'm going to try to be concise. I enjoyed the first two books, immensely. They both hit the ground running and were very difficult to put down. Ms. Collins had excellent character development done early on. You felt a part of the story. They both moved non-stop in their plots. So much so, I looked forward to book 3 and felt the novel disappointing. It seems Katniss takes a back seat, never in control of her destiny, as in the first 2 novels. There are very abrupt endings to some of the story's issues and characters. A good deal of the story revolves around hospitalization, for both emotional and physical healing. Wherein the plots in the first two books were laid out nicely, this one seems to bound all over the place. I didn't find this plot taking off before 85% in the Kindle edition. Unlike some, I liked the ending. Though it was quite a chore getting there. Give it a shot, but don't set your expectations high. It's lethargic compared to 1 & 2, almost as if written by a different author.
