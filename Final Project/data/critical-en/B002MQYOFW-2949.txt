An interesting concept poorly executed. That sums my feelings about it. The author's prose is weak and the main character (Katniss) is annoying to say the least. She is self-absorb and clueless 90% of the time. I really wanted to like this book and went in with an open mind but the book didn't do it for me. I give it 3 stars for the concept and story.
