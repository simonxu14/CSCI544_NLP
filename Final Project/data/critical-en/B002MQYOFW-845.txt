I had such great expectations for the final book of the Hunger Games series.  After being greatly satisfied with Hunger Games and Catching Fire, I was really excited to read a grand conclusion to this trilogy.  I was sadly disappointed.  It seemed rushed as if the author was just interested in getting it over with as soon as possible.  The ending was terrible!  What happened to Gale?  There was a huge disconnect between how Katniss' feelings changed so drastically, and so fast for Peeta.  Ugh!  I would have appreciated if the author would have expounded on how Katniss makes her decision so we could follow rather than being forced to accept something that didn't seem natural.  The only hope left is if some of these misses are corrected in the film version.
