What a letdown! I feel like I just wasted months of my life following this series. Katniss was supposed to be the symbol of hope... but in the end, she was nothing but a hollow shell. What  a waste of a great character.<br /><br /> After reading the first two books and learned that a movie was coming, I started convincing family and friends that the movie was a must-see (like Star Wars and Harry Potter).<br /><br />Now, I'm not even going to watch the movie because I know the ending would be such a disappointment. I am a Peeta fan and never warmed up to Gale.Yet I still hated the ending.
