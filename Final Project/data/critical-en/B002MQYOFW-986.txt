I got the impression reading this book that it is a form of the torture porn that has become so popular in movies these days.  There is so much senseless violence, with absolutely no redeeming features.  The real insult is when you get to the end and read "About the Author:"  "...she continues to explore the effects of war and violence on those coming of age."<br /><br />That sounds like an insult and a slap to the face after finishing this book.  There are allusions to themes such as feudalism, class, humanity, ethics, morality, rebellion when subjected to tyranny, etc.  But none of these are explored in any meaningful way.  She just tosses them aside, through Catnip's mouth, saying, "Well none of that would keep me alive, so whatever."<br /><br />To take that tact throughout the book, to give it some potential and then toss that potential aside so effortlessly, just to end by saying you were trying to explore the effects of war and violence on children all along?  What a joke.<br /><br />The werewolfs, the redheaded mute, the young group of preppers who at first seem cognizant of the disgusting nature of the event, only to end up prattling on like gossiping teenagers about where they were and what they were doing when this or that kid was killed...  A post-apocalyptic world there have been natural disasters and resource wars, still left in tact after one faction used nuclear/biological weapons on another, yet for some reason there is a powerful air force capable of swooping in anywhere at a moment's notice?  A world in which mutant birds had to be genetically engineered in order to conduct SIGINT operations, yet there are invisible cameras capable of capturing every single piece of action that happens in the arena?  What happened to all of that?  None of it is explained.  Indeed, none of it is even treated as a problem.<br /><br />At the end of the book, none of that is even really referenced.  It all ends *spoiler alert* on Catnip's conundrum of Gale vs Peeta.  Oooohhh, so very compelling.<br /><br />The only reason why I will finish this trilogy is because my cousin loves the books, and she wants me to be interested in something that she likes.  Hopefully some of these themes and questions will be explored in the later books, but I have my doubts.
