I lived the first book. Liked the second and we really let down with the third. Mocking jay. The last several chapters felt so rushed. Heartless. Like the writer gave up. I was very sad by how Finnick was just killed with no real description. No mourning his loss. He was just dead. Oh well. After the writer had invested so much time having us see he wasn't a jerk after all then falling in love with him. Gale just disappears from the final chapter. So bizzare to me. The whole book is spent focusing on killin president snow. Then he ends of left to die tied to a post? Lame at best. I really felt it hard to connect with the mother in This last book as well. Also she seemed to really avoid all the other characters in this book. Always sleeping or hiding in closets. I really had higher expectations. And the epilogue was dreadful. She had kids only because gale wanted them. Didn't even seem happy to be with peeta or have her children.
