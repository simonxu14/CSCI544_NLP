I can't believe the Suzanne Collins dropped the ball on this book. Very disappointed with the very RUSHED ending and omission of details. From the first book to the second, she created a large romantic tension between Katniss, Peeta, and Gale. By the end of "Catching Fire" and "Mockingjay", it was all gone. Suzanne Collins suddenly wants to turn the audience that the importance is no longer Katniss' feelings, but on the war itself. And ONLY the war. She created so much tragedy of her deceased friends/family that her attempt to bring back the romance between Katniss and Peeta was pretty much... A pathetic attempt to remind the viewers that she did indeed Love Peeta. You don't feel the tension of romance anymore. Grief is the only thing the reader can feel by the end.<br /><br />Overall... Very disappointed. Suzzane Collins had the idea well placed... and dropped the ball at the end zone... =(
