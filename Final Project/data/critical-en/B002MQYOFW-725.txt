A fun, easy read, good for a rainy weekend when there's nothing better to do, but basically seems to be a little over hyped. It's another unconventional teenage love triangle with a female heroine, only set in a politically dissident background. Will go see the movie but this was not a life changed or mind blower for me by any stretch
