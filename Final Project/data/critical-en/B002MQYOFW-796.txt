I had been warned by many friends that mockingjay was their least favorite in the hunger games series.  I'm not usually one to be swayed by outside opinion, so I started mockingjay looking for things that I liked about the book.  Unfortunately Suzanne Collins bit of more than she could chew with this book and the result is a hastily written, unimaginative ending to the series.<br /><br />Many other reviewers have argued that those disappointed with mockingjay were looking for a fairy tail ending. This is a shortsighted critique of those who didn't like the book.  I appreciated Collins' attempt to show the realities of war, but she used the same plot line to demonstrate the horrors again, and again, and again.  The entire book could be summarized into "Katniss is depressed, Katniss tries to become the mockingjay, Katniss gets inured, Katniss wakes up in a hospital in a cloudy haze."  By the fourth or fifth reiteration I was so bored by this plot line that I no longer cared about any overarching message.<br /><br />Collins also packed the book with too many story lines and characters.  Many of the character's outcomes were simply forgotten or resolved in a few short sentences. Additionally there were so many undeveloped characters and plot lines that I constantly had to flip back through the book to figure out who they were speaking with and where the characters were in the story line.<br /><br />The book also never took the time to show how Katniss and Peeta were eventually able to move on from what they had experienced.  It seems much easier to spend over 300 pages breaking down these character's emotional stability, but Collins didn't tackle the harder side of that story to show how someone can cope with what they've experienced.  Instead she tries to explain the character's will to live in a short epilogue that was too little too late.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book and I appreciate what Collins tried to do, unfortunately she does not seem to be a skilled enough author to accomplish such a profound message.
