A pretty steep drop-off in quality over the first two books.  The Hunger Games are over, and there's chaos in this distopian future.  Collins isn't as skilled at wrapping-up the story as she was at creating this world, and having its characters fight to the death.<br /><br />That being said, if you've made it this far, it's worth finishing the series.  Just dont expect the book to blow your mind.
