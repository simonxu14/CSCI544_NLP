I'm appalled by the poor quality of the writing in this book.  Collins has interesting ideas, but she desperately needs writing help, perhaps in the form of a good editor.<br /><br />She violates, repeatedly, the first and foremost rule of dynamic writing:  She tells instead of shows.  Seriously, pretty much the whole book was "told" to the reader, instead of "shown" to the reader.  And, honestly, when your narrator is knocked out or otherwise incapacitated for most of the book, what else can you do but "tell" the story?  You sure can't show it if your main character is unconscious.  I don't know what Collins was thinking using that plot device.  It hampered her story, and her writing, tremendously.<br /><br />Collins is Queen of the Incomplete Sentences.  The book is just rife with them!  A good, heck, even just a competent editor, would have done wonders for this book.  I don't know who edited this book, but whomever it was needs to be fired.  Collins uses incomplete sentences all the way through the book.  For example, "A squad of Peacekeepers checking for returning refugees." Or, "The same side." Or, "Right on the spot where Johanna Mason hit me with the coil of wire." These are NOT sentences!  Ugh, there's really no excuse for this type of horrible writing.  In one of my college writing courses, I remember the professor saying to the class, "It takes a gifted and talented writer to use incomplete sentences.  YOU are not that writer!"  Well, I submit that Collins is not that writer, either.<br /><br />Someone needs to buy her, and her editor, a copy of William Strunk's The Elements of Style.<br /><br />What's saddest to me is that this book purports to be for young adults.  How on earth are kids supposed to know what good writing looks like if the books marketed to them are so completely substandard?
