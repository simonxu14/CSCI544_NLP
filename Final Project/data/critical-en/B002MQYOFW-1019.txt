It's a book for kids. Teenagers will love it since the story it tailor toward them, but the writing is not all that compelling and it is only a slight variation on a number of similar themed books from years gone by.  It was good enough that I did not abandon reading it, but not compelling enough that I wanted to waste my time reading any of the sequels.
