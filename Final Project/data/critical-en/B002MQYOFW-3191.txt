I felt like I had to finish the series after reading the first two books.  This third book was so tedious, it took me over a month to finally finish it.  I really felt that the author had to finish her commitment to have a trilogy and all the things I loved about Katniss in the first, and even second, book were gone. Our heroine turns from someone who makes things happen to someone who has things happen to her.  Disappointing.
