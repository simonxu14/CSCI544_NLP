I loved the first book, the Hunger Games.  In the third book, I was disappointed that the character never developed the depth that was promised in the first book.  She seemed like a puppet with no substance, and kept cheating death (nine lives Catniss?)which was tiresome after the what, the 3rd time?  Even the climax (the payback), which was supposed to be a shock, was rather predictable. The end just babbled on and on.  It was a "....and they lived happily ever after," ending, but the reader isn't happy.  The author let us down with poor a poor attempt at resolving all the details. Readers of the saga will want to read it, if only to have closure.  After such an ending, you are definitely not wishing for another book.
