This book was extremely disappointing. There was a lack of action. Instead of Katniss being engaged in the war, she spends most of her time filming videos for District 13 to air, or sleeping due to being drugged. Since the book is told from Katniss's point of view, the reader misses out on all of the action happening while she's asleep, and the author decides to give the reader a two paragraph summary of what Katniss missed out on, some of which were major plot points in the book - the rescue of Peeta and the assassination of President Snow. These summaries caused the pacing of the book to become rushed, especially in the final chapters and epilogue, and it felt like Collins was simply trying to get writing the book over with.
