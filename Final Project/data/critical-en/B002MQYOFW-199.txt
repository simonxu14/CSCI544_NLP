I have enjoyed reading this series. It's a great story that's hard to put down, with tension that never wanes. But as much as I enjoyed the first 2 books, the final book of the trilogy didn't do as much for me, for many reasons.<br /><br />An accomplished writer I know once said that he prefers stories in which he likes the main character(s), even if they're highly flawed. Somewhere in the middle of the book, I realized I no longer liked Katniss. Even before the horrors of the war, she behaves like a sullen teen, making everything about her, looking for reasons to spew anger at anyone, thinking about herself instead of the big picture. While she's never been a nice person, her protection of her family and Peeta in previous books and her willingness to adapt to harsh circumstances made us like her. That's gone here. Moreover, Gale has a mostly useless role and Peeta's been turned into a freak show. It was the other characters - Haymitch, Finnick, even Johanna - I liked.<br /><br />Much of the book is dark and gruesome, with one grisly injury or death after the next. It never ends. During the war, the book hurtles 999 ways to die at the reader. Nets with barbs. Bombs that blow people to bits. Steam that burns you alive. More muttations. Children being blown up. Key characters dying right and left. After a while I lost interest and the deaths seemed almost cartoonish. I understand the importance of conveying the horrors of war - but the author has already shown she is good at that, and this would have been more effective if there was more emphasis on the characters and less on endless descriptions of all the ways the Capitol devised to kill people.<br /><br />[SPOILERS]<br />Finally, while I understand important characters must be sacrificed in a story like this, Finnick's death made me put down the book and not want to pick it up again. It was unworthy of such a great character, to just get devoured like any disposable minor character. Worse, there was barely any mention of him afterward. By the time Prim died, I didn't care much because so many other disgusting things had happened that I had nothing left to feel attached to. Not good.<br /><br />I liked the ending. It befitted the book. I'll admit I expected her to wind up with Gale, not Peeta. But as the story drew on, it became more difficult to imagine her with anyone, and the author's choice made sense.<br /><br />Overall, even with these criticisms, this was an impressive series and I greatly look forward to the movies.
