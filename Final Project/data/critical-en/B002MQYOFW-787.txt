This book was a nice wrap up of the trilogy, though I thought it lacked a quality that the other two books had.This was my least favorite of the three books. I am just looking forward to the second part of the thrid book to come out in theaters, hopefully Jennifer Lawrence can pull this plot together betted than Suzan Collins
