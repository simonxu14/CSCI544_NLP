I can't believe how very poorly this book was written.  When you are a writer, especially one of a series.  You need to be aware of what your readers want, why they have chosen to take the time to read your story.  You need to know this so that you can address those ideas.  Collins writes this third book as if no one got attached to Katniss and Peeta in the first two books, as if we were all reading this book because we wanted a good war story.  I applauded the first two books where she didn't make katniss a sniveling boy crazy girl with nothing more on her mind. She had strength, spunk, and character.  She made you think. But in the last book the thing that everyone wanted to see was katniss finally give her heart away.  I wanted it to be Peeta, but even if it was Gale that would have been something.  No, in this final book it just shows her wasting away into a shell of herself.  Nothing.  the entire book is focused on the war.  There is no resolution.  Of course the Capitol is finally overthrown, but who cares.  If Collins actually thought that we were reading because we were invested in her fictional war.  We were invested in the characters!<br /><br /> There were many places in the book where she could have saved the book, but she just kept killing tha characters off.  In this book she kills them ALL off, either in flesh, spirit, or mind. Every last one the the characters is dead.  If her point was that this is what war does, well bravo. Most of us know war sucks, but we wern't reading this for a recap on that moral lesson. If we wanted that we could have picked up a book on the harsh realities of a real war..such as Vietnam.  This book was a EPIC FAIL!  It makes we feel like the first two were a waste of time, and I loved them.  So disgusted and disappointed.
