You think that something great is going to happen at the end of the book it is a political statement. Although I thought a lot about my grandfather and all of the atrocities that he witnessed in WWII. Sometimes it's good to look for those happy endings.  Sometimes people get too caught up in life and its negativity. I want to always think that there will be a happy ending. Thats what keeps me going and clarifying to my self that it's &#34;real&#34;.
