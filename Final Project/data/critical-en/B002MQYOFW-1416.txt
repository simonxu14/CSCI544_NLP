The other reviews are correct. The author has you from the first page and you just can't quit reading. But, I will not buy the other books in the trilogy. Even though I am sixty years old, I found the premise of this book terribly disturbing. A post American world that lives in districts with a dictatorship is frightening enough. But a return to the times of the gladiators shows our culture in a decline I don't even want to think about. While the book was well written and certainly captivating, I will not be reading the sequels.
