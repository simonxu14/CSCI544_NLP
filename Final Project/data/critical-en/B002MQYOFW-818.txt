I enjoyed the first two books and was liking the third. That is, up until I got to the end of chapter 24.  Suddenly, everything was over!!!  I couldn't believe it. You just meet this interesting character in chapter 23 (Tigris) and you are looking forward to how Katniss is going get to Snow. Then Wham!!!  It's over. I couldn't believe it. What was the point of Katniss and her group even being there at all?  I  had been wondering how things were going to work, considering I was almost to the end of the book.  Well, I know now.  The last three chapters of the book are just a weird, dreamlike, depressing &#34;finally&#34;, with a lot left hanging that could have been developed. From chapter 24  ...could have been a whole other fourth book! ... with a much more interesting and powerful ending. Instead, it was a very pointless and disappointing end, to what could have been a great series.  It almost made me sorry that I had even started reading the Hunger Games. It is like the author just got tired of writing the series and ended everything as abruptly as possible.  I think she missed an opportunity of a lifetime. So although I was enjoying the book up until chapter 24, I am giving it only one star because of how the author brought this promising series to its end. (I haven't seen the movies, but I hope they somehow create a better ending than this.)
