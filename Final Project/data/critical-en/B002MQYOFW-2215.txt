This my first ever review for a book although I read a lot. But I felt compelled to do a review because this book was a huge disappointment to me. The only reason I started reading the series was because I saw that they will be making it into a movie and the only reason they would do that is because it's a good series.<br /><br />Like everyone else I LOVED The Hunger Games and Catching Fire was really good. But this book was bad from the beginning till the end and I don't know why I kept reading it, probably just to find out how bad it could get.<br /><br />It dragged and dragged and I started skimming pages. All the Characters that I loved from The Hunger Games, Katniss, Peeta and Haymitch, changed completely and you can hardly relate to them or recognize them.<br /><br />Peeta was so damaged and changed, and Haymitch, I feel so sad for this character. One of the most important and you can barely feel his dry humor or presence in this book.<br /><br />And Prim, poor Prim, the whole story started with her and I guess the writer though she wants to end it with her, but it was such a bad ending. I didn't feel anything for her death which means it was pointless and bad.<br /><br />What's really disappointing was that by the end of the book, I really hated Katniss and I wanted her to die. I thought that would be a great ending to our misery and her and Peeta's misery. I can't believe that she voted for the repeat of the Hunger Games for the Capital children. That's so against everything that Katniss presents. What a bad move from the writer.<br /><br />I just hope what ever damage was done with this book could be hidden in the movie and we can get some kind of closure instead of this dissatisfaction.
