the picture on the site is NOT what i recieved! i was looking for the original print of this book, the one in the image and instead i got the new reprinted editions that have the different covers (the adult versions) which is fine to read but i'm trying to complete my collection of the ones i read when i was little! and thsi wont do! i'm very dissapointed as now i'm going to have to get another copy. money wasted.
