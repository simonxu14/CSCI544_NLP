I've been a huge fan of the Harry Potter series for a long time now, and I have to say, these books were all brilliant up until the seventh book.  This one was overly long and drawn out, poorly written, and predictable to a fault, except of course when something ridiculous happens.<br /><br />Rowling breaks the rules of her world in just about every other chapter.  Problems and plot twists are consistently summed up by the simple explanation of "something strange happened that nobody ever knew was possible".  Examples: the sparks from Harry's wand, Kings Cross, Ron coming back.<br /><br />The entirety of the wand plot fits this bill perfectly.  Nobody had any inkling previous to this book that disarming someone's wand made you the rightful owner of the wand...yet that fact is of the utmost importance in the final scene when Voldemort learns that Draco is the rightful owner of his wand since Draco was the one that cast the disarming spell...wait a minute, all of the characters have been busy disarming each other all throughout the course of this series!  That must mean that all of the wand ownerships have been discombobulated somewhere along the lines!  As it turns out, the fact that there has been established precedence over the use of the wand-ownership rule has no bearing on the fact that Rowling needed something to happen and so she broke the rules to make it so.  Also note that Dumbledore beat someone whose wand was apparently "unbeatable".  Way to stay consistent!<br /><br />Other times, the author includes obvious references to other fantasy/literature and world history events just for the heck of it (and of course, to add an almost pointless plot twist besides).  Examples: Griffyndor's sword, the locket, the fact that the entire ministry of magic is Nazi Germany, etc.<br /><br />The book was stretched out needlessly just so that it could conform to the school year and the pacing of the original books.  Harry and Hermione wander aimlessly around the world going on quests that lead nowhere and add nothing to the plot (Godric's Hallow, endless camping sequences).  In addition, many characters from previous books that were unimportant to the plot of this book make their unnecessary (and page-wasting) return (Krum and Rita Skeeter in particular, but there were more).<br /><br />If you're like me and you enjoy reading about some of the minor characters like Luna, Ginny, MaGonnagal, Draco, etc...be prepared, because they get almost no screen time whatsoever, with the single exception being Neville.  Ginny is consistently kept out of the way because she is underage, and this volume goes to show that her entire purpose in the series was just to eventually become Harry's girlfriend.  A very disappointing way to develop her character.<br /><br />Then there are the main characters, who consistently act out of character, and prove to be rather poor role models for the children who are reading these books.  Hermione and Ron suddenly both become incompetent wizards who yell at each other ceaselessly, Harry performs an unforgivable curse and apparently feels no remorse whatsoever, Lupin goes from being a strong positive influence into a weakling, and that scene between Harry and Ginny in her bedroom was a bit too suggestive for a children's book if you ask me.  In addition, Ron gives Harry a book about how to seduce witches (even though he should clearly be able to tell that Harry is interested in his little sister- yuck!).<br /><br />As far as I can count, Hagrid should have died three times during the course of the book, yet lives on despite.  The same can be said of Lucius Malfoy, who seems to get an endless number of screwups and still remains on Voldemort's good side.  Of the characters who do die, there is often very little reason that they should have died, and even less explanation of who killed them and how it was done.  In the cases where we do see the character's dying, it is often for unexplained reasons (just what exactly happened to wormtail's hand where it suddenly became possessed?...oh yeah, another bit of "mystery magic").<br /><br />Let's not even get into the epilogue.  That was a complete and total waste of space, talking only about the five characters whose fate we could have guessed from as early as book 3...and where does Rowling get those awful names?<br /><br />As others have mentioned, the addition of the Hallows added nothing to the plot whatsoever.  The horcruxes were plenty on their own, and because Dumbledore spelled them out in detail in the last book, there was no mystery there.  In fact, there was no defining plot line like there were in other books.  Every action scene basically uncovered one of the missing horcruxes, so there was no "oh wow, I wasn't expecting that!" moments like there were in every other book of the series.  It was like watching the characters go through a checklist.<br /><br />And then there were the totally unbelievable sequences that catch you off guard with just how ridiculous they are.  Can anyone tell how Harry managed to crash land the motor bike exactly at the spot where he was supposed to land, or how Hagrid managed to survive jumping off said flying motorbike, and live to tell the tale?  Why can Voldemort suddenly fly on his own?  why did voldemort choose to light the sorting hat on fire and use that to torture neville?  Why is it that nobody seems to be able to tell that Harry is still breathing in the forest scene?  Of course I know that this is a fiction story, and fantasy besides, but it really sucks the realism out of the world, which Rowling has worked so hard to keep up for the first six books, when these sorts of things happen.<br /><br />Then, in quite possibly the only worthwhile and unexpected twist in the entire book, Rowling manages to all but ruin one fan-favorite character.  The rest of the story unfolds almost exactly as we all expected it to from the beginning.  Snape's character development was one of the only worthwhile pieces in the book.<br /><br />Overall, a very poor way to end an otherwise phenomenal series.
