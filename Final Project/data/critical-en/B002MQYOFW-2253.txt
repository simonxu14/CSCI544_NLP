The series is very easy to read, and quite engrossing, but the writing tends to get a bit hackneyed by the last book, and the repetition of combat in each book (the Hunger games arena in books 1 and 2 and rebellion in book 3) tends to get a bit dull. Still, as a young adult book, it's quite good. I's essentially Battle Royale for kids.
