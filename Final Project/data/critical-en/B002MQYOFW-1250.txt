I found it to be a fairly good novel, but, when all was said and done, the entertainment gauge came up only to Fair. In spite of the large number of reviews, I didn't find the few that seemed just right, so here's my take.<br /><br />The premise of the book is extrapolated from the popular TV Reality Show genre together with a few other fictional plot themes, such as the "despotic, decadent government," and "kids forced to cope with terrible circumstances". The plot was good, with plenty of twists at regular intervals, the writing was clear and straightforward, and the central characters were interesting. However, nothing rose above the ordinary, and the ending was a complete non-ending.<br /><br />I appreciated the author's avoidance of three over-used writers' crutches: profanity, sex, and gore. The presentation is suitable for a youth audience, and probably much healthier than many books, movies, and teen-oriented video games. It could serve as a stimulus for moral discussion, if parents or adults can avoid being too dogmatic. The book itself does not preach, and the characters as individuals are painted in different moral shades of gray. No superheroes and not much focus on super-villains.<br /><br />It was an enjoyable read, and the plot moved well enough to keep me wondering about the outcome. But, after finishing the book, I have no interest in the remainder of the series.
