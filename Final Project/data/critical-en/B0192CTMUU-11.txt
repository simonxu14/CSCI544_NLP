It seems that this book was just a long way to re-introducing everyone to Voldemort. The whole Wizard Championship tournament meant nothing to the real realm of what the HP series is about. A character was introduced and killed in the same book. I don't think enough time was spent on delving into who Cedric really was in order for the audience to connect and feel deep shock or remorse when he died. This to me was just a filler book to prepare us for the next.
