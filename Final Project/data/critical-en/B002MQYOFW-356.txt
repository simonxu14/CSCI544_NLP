I will keep this short and simple without any spoilers for those who haven't read the book. Truth is, if you have read the other two you will definitely buy and read this one. Why? Because the other two are absolutely GREAT! I finished one, immediately bought book two and then immediately bought book three because I couldn't stop reading...the only downfall is that after two great books, Mockingjay fails to impress. Not because it doesn't deliver the happy ending everybody is waiting for but rather because the author does not adhere to the same writing style and story as before. Instead, she uses the third book as blatant anti-war propaganda instead of just weaving her propaganda into the story - like she previously did in books one and two. She could have still gotten the message across without blatantly saying it. All of the sudden I felt like I was reading an essay, not the end of a trilogy. Lost the characters, lost the story. Maybe it was her intention...but it wasn't well received at all. After all that waiting, the thought that this book is the last is very disappointing.
