I loved the first two books.  I read them back to back, staying up well past 3:00 A.M.,  three night's in a row.  I could not put the book down, I felt so drawn into Katniss, Peeta and Gale's lives.  Not the case with "Mockingjay." I am struggling to get through this one.  Slow moving, the characters aren't pulling me in like the first two books did. I just may have to put this one down and forget about it.  Disapointing  read!
