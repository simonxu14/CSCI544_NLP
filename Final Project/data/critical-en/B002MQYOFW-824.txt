I found the entire Hunger Games series to be disappointing, especially because this book, the final installment in the series, is disappointing.  After jerking our emotions around for the two prior books, the emotional gyrations and dissatisfaction only increase with this book, which after reading three books filled with violence, fear, terror, and crushing disappointment, brings no satisfying resolution to the story.  It is a gripping story that you can't put down, but it really only manipulates the reader's emotions and expectations without providing any satisfaction in the end.  Reading the Hunger Games trilogy is an exercise in emotional masochism.  The only hints of hope and resolution come in the epilogue, which is all too brief.  The ending of this book came across to me as if the author just got tired of writing the story and so hastily wrapped it up in haphazard fashion.  I say, don't waste your time and energy on this series.  Yes, it's gripping, but to no good end.
