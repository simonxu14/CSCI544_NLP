I am an avid reader and consider myself a decent writer/speaker, as well.  After watching the first movie in this series I was intrigued and eagerly picked up the trilogy to dig into the details that the big screen missed.  What I found was very disappointing.<br /><br />The writing style is so horrible that I couldn't get past chapter two.  The sentence structure is repeated and varies very little, and the descriptive techniques may as well be absent.  She focuses on the most mundane of information and moves on suddenly; it seems a poor attempt at immersing the readers in her world.  If you know what &#34;show; not tell&#34; is, then know that this is the complete opposite.  I have to say that this is one of the rare cases where the movie greatly outshines the novel.  I still eagerly await the coming films, but have no plans to read past chapter two.
