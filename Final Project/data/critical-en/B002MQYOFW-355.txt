Well, since it's the last book in the series you HAVE to read it.  Just don't expect too much.  I really got the feeling that the author wasn't too sure how to wrap up the story, and especially how to deal with the Peeta-Gale issue, so she just threw something together and gave up.  For a series that started with so much promise, it was a very unsatisfactory ending.<br /><br />I'm actually hoping that when they make the movie they fix it up and make a better story and ending out of it.
