I think most of the other low star reviews and intensive reviews online cover this, so I'll keep this short and sassy:<br /><br />1. Katniss ain't a role model, She's as blank a slate as Bella and as realistic as Anita Blake.<br />2. The plot is tired and it plods.<br />3. Nothing about the world building makes a whole lot of sense without backstory that is missing. Even then, I don't think that Panem can be properly explained.<br />4. The love triangle? No way. Just.... no.... way. It felt completely tacked on, like something the editors demanded.
