The title basically says it all. It's a great series and all, and this is suppose to be how it ends. But to my dismay, it ends in the most anti-climatic ways possible. Now I won't ruin it for you, and this book should still be read since it's a major part of the trilogy, but just brace yourself to be unsatisfyed.
