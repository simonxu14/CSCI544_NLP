Call me old fashioned but I don't care for the pervasive theme of kids killing kids throughout these books.  I am very much aware of the political, sociological, and alternate universe stories that run through Hunger Games and I will admit that I felt a certain satisfaction when certain characters got their just desserts.  Although there is no blatant sex scenes written into the story and in the end the heroes triumph (well sort of) I find I really can't recommend this series to anyone under the age of 17 due to rather graphic imageries of violence and dark themes.  It's a sad statement on today's society that this is what is offered  to our kids.
