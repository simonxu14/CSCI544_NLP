Overall, I think this was a nice ending to the trilogy, but after thinking about it for an evening, I have to say that it's not my favorite of the series.  Yes, it wrapped everything up.  We find out, mostly, what happens to everyone in the end.<br /><br />However, unlike the other two books in the series, I found that I mostly didn't care.  It took me a day to figure out why that was.  I realized that in the first two books it's because of Katniss.  Her emotions are so raw & so genuine that as the narrator those emotions ooze out of the story & you take them on as your own.  The deaths in the book pain you as the reader, the victories are your victories; as the reader you are RIGHTTHERE with Katniss every step of the way.  Her joy, her triumph, her fear, her disdain... the first two books engage you on every level emotionally.  However, in MOCKINGJAY, Katniss is so detached, that as the reader, I was detached as well.  I found that just as she wanted to hide behind a pipe and nap, so did I.  Yes, there was action, but I was an observer, just as she was.  I wasn't as engaged or involved or even as concerned, even when characters that I knew I should (& did) care more about were involved.  MOCKINGJAY felt very sterile and clinical in a way that the first two books did not.  It's the only way I can describe it.  Even in the ending I felt no joy- not for or from Katniss, or for myself in having finished the tale.
