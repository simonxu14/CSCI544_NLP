I picked this gem up from Amazon and read it in a few days. I had read some reviews in this area and though people were a bit rough on the book until I read it. It is my least favorite Potter book however it was still a real good read. Potter just came off as a whinny little kid, far from his stature of the other books. He spent his 5th year screaming at his friends at the top of his lungs and in self pity about his life. There was one stretch in a chapter where I almost put the book down in disgust. But, it ended well. I found that this book had a lot of inconstancies in it and logic gaps that I resented. Why Crab and Goyle whom were seen with "You know who" didn't get called on it. Potter and the gang had several attempts to jab at the "whatever you Deatheater"... I just didn't like that logic flow and the parts with the new evil head master who sent the demontors after Harry and no one seems to care (well, it was never really explained past that).<br /><br />Sure Potter is fantasy but the other books made sense to me in a lot of logical ways as far as story line goes.
