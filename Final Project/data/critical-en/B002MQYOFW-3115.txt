The book manages to suck you in right from the get go - it showed a lot of promise. Despite borrowing themes from Battle Royale and the Chuunin exams from Naruto, the action scenes were exciting enough that I couldn't put this book down... until it started turning into some sappy, predictable love story. I didn't want it to go there, but it went there. It feels like a lot of young adult fantasy books end up like this. I'm guessing Twilight fans would love this book. I am utterly disappointed, felt a bit cheated, and somewhat regret purchasing the next two books... but I will read them anyway since I bought them. I can't help but be reminded of the movie The Adjustment Bureau, and how it captures you in the beginning, then turns into something completely different. Overall, it's still good light reading. It's more enjoyable than disappointing, hence the 3 stars.
