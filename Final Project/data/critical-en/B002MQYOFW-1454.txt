Book 1 in the series was brilliant, book 2 was an incredible good twist and a very good follow up. Book 3 was torturous to read. It is slow, has very few touching points with book 1 and it develops the characters in completely different directions than the previous 2 books. It's like Collins wanted to write a high pace action script instead of a good book 3. I see the point she was trying to make, but it still remains a book that has very little to do with the complete series. Unnecessary violence, too much war, too much killing, too little character development of the main people and too much plotlines. Let's not even go for the amount of "coincidences" and "wow that is convenient" in the book... After a marathon read of 7 hours, I came away feeling empty and as if I have been waiting for nothing.
