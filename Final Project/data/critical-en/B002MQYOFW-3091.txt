I finished the first book last night and I was very happy to have a book that kept me interested. But not because I loved the characters or the concept. I think its more like a tragedy that unfolds in front of you and you cant help but see what happens next. I wont give away any specific details or major spoilers but the idea of making children murder other children is a combination of historic Rome (for the slave Gladiators and political tyranny) and "Lord of the Flies" (kids killing other kids).<br /><br />I know adults have read this book, but seeing as I'm 30 its clear to me that a book about murdering children, is really just for kids. I say this because the story is told through the perspective of a young teen girl, although strong and gritty... still comes off as freshly annoying/immature. That and the usually predictable love triangle that has to exist in all cheesy books that send young things reeling at the idea of a "kiss" here and a "kiss" there.<br /><br />I suppose someone has to satisfy the romantics but the idea or inserting teenage love during a lethal arena just didnt convince me of the horror they were facing. The author could have avoided it completely but instead distracts you with it. In fact I was distracted by other, what I would term, unecessary details.<br /><br />My suggestion is, if you have insomnia (like I do at times) or need a reason to ignore your cabin fever in winter... this is a decent book to read. However, I have zero interest in continuing this book series and would only recommend it for people 21 and younger.
