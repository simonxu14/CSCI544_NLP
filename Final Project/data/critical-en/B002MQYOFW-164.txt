I became hooked on the first two books of the trilogy and was hoping that this would wrap up the story with the same level of excitement.  Unfortunately, I couldn't wait to be done with it.  It seemed to be an aimless story with an unremarkable ending.  The plot line is just a mess and I found it difficult to take interest in what happened to any of the protagonists by the end, despite the investment in the first two books.  Utterly disappointing.
