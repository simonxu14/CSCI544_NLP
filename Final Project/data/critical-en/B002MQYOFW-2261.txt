after reading parts of  this book, I finally understand why it is classified &#34;young adult&#34;... The characters are pale, simplistic and frankly, irritating. The story plot becomes increasingly absurd. The author's lack of strong literary skills shines through the poorly constructed story fabric.<br /><br />If you appreciate complex character development, rich plots that that are at once dramatic and believable, don't waste your money and time on this one.
