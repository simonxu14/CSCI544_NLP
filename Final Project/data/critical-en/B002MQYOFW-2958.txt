While the story is fast-paced and loaded with action, it lacks real character development and depth of plot.  Clearly this is a story for young readers.  It reminded me of A Wrinkle in Time which is a youth novel.  I'm afraid I don't see the appeal to adult audiences, nor can I look forward to the continuing adventures of Catniss et al.
