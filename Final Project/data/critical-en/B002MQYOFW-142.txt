Did you ever go to a movie, and it was filled with non-stop action, great characters, and a wonderful story...and then it just ended as if the director had run out of film or time?<br /><br />That's exactly how I felt when I got to the end of Suzanne Collins's final book in the Hunger Games trilogy.  What a huge disappointment!  Yes, I saw it coming: she did set up that scene in the palace gardens in the earlier books.<br /><br />But who would have thought she'd go from the anticlimax into an epilogue even more disappointing than the one at the end of the Harry Potter books?  I'm glad I read all three books in one weekend -- I'd have been truly angry if I'd waited a year or more for the final installment and then was left with this godawful mess.<br /><br />What a shame that the editors didn't force Collins to treat her readers with a bit more respect in the final chapter!
