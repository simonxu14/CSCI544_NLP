After years of waiting for the final showdown, this is the best Rowling could give us? We were thoroughly disappointed.<br /><br />She had greatness in her grasp and had mapped it out perfectly. Snape was going to go down. That was a given. Anyone could have guessed that, for Lily's sake, he would die defending Harry. However, instead of the blaze of honorable, brave glory that he deserved after years as Harry's protector, Rowling has him walk right into his death, and poof, he's gone. Didn't even get to draw his wand or even knick old Voldemort!  Not fair! Shame on her!<br /><br />And... it was a bloodbath! She killed off so many beloved characters! No one was safe by the end! The worst were Hedgewig, Colin, and a Weasley!! We half expected Hagrid to get it in the end. It was horrible and senseless! She even kills off Tonks and Remus leaving Teddy an orphan!  Just nasty! And yet the Malfoys emerge without casualties!  What was she thinking?<br /><br />And then, the worst was that we get to see them all years later! Hermione Granger, the brightest witch of her age is now doing what? She seems to be a housewife!?!?! Only Neville appears to be doing something with his life.  The rest are all just playing house out in suburbia?!?!?!  What kind of ending is that?  Harry Potter, dad, husband, lawnmower?!?!? Please!  What kind of ending is that?<br /><br />And the middle is just plain boring.  Pages and pages of hiding in the woods....Talk about anti climactic!<br />Honestly, Harry's had the Invisibility Cloak since year 1 but, Ron and Hermione never told him that there was this story about the Deathly Hallows? What the heck was she thinking!<br />She wrote like she was tired and just wanted to wrap it up already.<br /><br />I loved the time we had between books 6 & 7 when we all tried to guess how it would go down!  That was fun! We had so much better ideas than Rowling! Shame.<br />All it was, in the end, was an ending.<br /> Oh, well.
