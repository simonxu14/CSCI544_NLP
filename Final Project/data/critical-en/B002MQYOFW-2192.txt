I'm sorry to say that I would only give this book a 3 star rating.  I was expecting much more after listening to so many good reviews, and people just voicing their opinions.  First, I had a really hard time with children killing each other for anything, but being manipulated made if ever worse.  I did read to the very end because even though I was uncomfortable with the story in general I had to give it a fair chance.  I do not plan on reading the next two and feel my time is too valuable, as well as there has to be much better books to read.
