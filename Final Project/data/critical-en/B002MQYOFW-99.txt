The good thing about these books is that I actually made it all the way through all three of them (unlike only getting through one and a half of that vampire/bella book series). This is a good dystopic story. My problems with it are first that it did not need to be told in three separate books. Book Two is a repeat of book one (with some action in it finally that I kept waiting for the entire first book). And second, book three shows beyond a doubt the problems that I already felt in the first parts that Collins chose to tell this story from the wrong character's point of view. The protagonists need to be active in their own destinies, a part of the story, catalysts, etc. A huge part of book three happens without Katniss and thus we as readers don't see it either. This is a case where the movies have the potential to be better than the books because they do not need to stay tied to one POV and can create those missing scenes.
