There are so many good reviews and I think most of them have spoilers and say what I thought about these books. So I'm gonna keep it short.<br /><br />The first book was *FANTASTIC*.<br />The second book was good.<br />The third book was a disaster.<br /><br />I was bored from chapters 1 through 8, but I decided to persist because of what I had read in prior books. After chapter 8, things start getting better, but the author uses cheap techniques to keep the story going... (introduce bunch of characters to be killed? oh please...)<br />Katniss, instead of evolving and becoming better (mature, independent, etc) actually does the opposite and she starts getting very annoying at so many levels.<br />The ending was bad. It didn't feel like it ended, it wasn't satisfying. I accept and actually like books with an open end, but Mockingjay didn't leave an open end, as it didn't finish a cycle (at least not for Katniss). It was really vague and there were things that shouldn't be explained that were overexplained and other things that should have that weren't at all.<br />I like cheesy epilogues (Harry Potter &lt;333), but this one was poorly done and unnecessary.<br /><br />If I want to summarize my feelings by the time I was done with the book I would just raise the question: AM I FREAKING READING A FAN FICTION?<br />I wish I hadn't read this book. Please, don't torture yourself if loved the series so far.
