Fond of self-centered, moody, spiteful, brainless, ungrateful teenagers? Read this series, 'cause this heroine's just right for you. By the time we get to the 3rd tedious volume where President Coin schemes to turn Katniss into a martyr for the revolution, I'm not the only one thinking, "Right on! Great idea!"<br /><br />I can't believe I read the whole thing. All three books, out of curiosity about all the hype. Hoping against hope that some gems of wisdom or good writing would appear. Sigh.<br /><br />Scholastic publishes the books and they are clearly marketed as "young adult", but I didn't realize the author is a teenager, too. Must be, given her weak writing style, one-dimensional characters, simplistic plot, vicious civil war with thousands of casualties yet seems distantly antiseptic, and a lack of the creativity that the current science fiction market demands. The people-hunting-people-for-sport meme is an old one, both in the real world (e.g., the Romans) and literature through the ages. "The Most Dangerous Game", written in the 1920's and famous for the fictitious "Malay mantrap", is probably the best-known. Ms Collins' version just doesn't measure up.<br /><br />In her portrayal of a spoiled teenage girl's approach to life and those around her, though, Ms Collins is a virtuoso. Somehow, our heroine manages to be "betrayed" by every one of her benefactors, even as they try to keep her alive. She lives in her own fantasy world where everything is about her. She never has a simple disagreement with anyone, but manages to "hate" everyone in turn and repeatedly, especially the two boys who inexplicably fawn over her and do their best to keep her alive in spite of her spurning them. The positive attributes that have turned her into the heroine of Panem are hard to fathom: really good with bow and arrow, brave (foolhardy, really), and . . . let's see . .  umm. Her metamorphosis into the revolution's icon is entirely the work of those who surround her, most of whom get killed while supporting her unworthy and ungrateful person.<br /><br />Sheesh. What a waste of a three day's reading time. At least they're a quick read. One book's-worth, really, stretched into three. Save your money.
