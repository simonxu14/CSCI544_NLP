I love to read, but as a busy mom and full-time student, I don't have much time to do so.  That's why I rely on Kindle whispersync.  I prefer to read, but it's so fantastic to be able to switch back and forth between the written page and the audio option!  I can read for a few minutes and then continue experiencing my book while cleaning, or cooking, or running errands.  For some reason, not only does whispersync not workforce this book, the written page book will not sync at all with the audiobook and vice versa.  I usually just use the Kindle app for my phone, but I can't get my audio version on Kindle.  Something to do with Pottermore.  Frustrating.  I won't be purchasing the rest of the series because of it - and it is a favorite series in my house.
