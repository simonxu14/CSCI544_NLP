I eagerly awaited this book and I was totally disappointed.<br />All of the other Harry Potter books I couldn't put down.  They were all high quality light-hearted tales that were totally captivating.  They were witty with entertaining comedy and cheerful flippancy.  Yet they were exciting with wizardly action.<br />This 5th book was a great disappointment. It was lifeless with a negativity that was unpleasant. It would make me question whether I would buy the next Rowling book.<br />All the other books were exciting to read sentence to sentence.  This book I would get bored and have to re-read sentences. I would just put the book down and read a couple of chapters a few days later. It took me until yesterday to get the book finished. It was very easy to put down.<br />I don't know what happened to the excitement and the charming witty comedy of the first books.<br />This book was like it was written by a different Author.  I wouldn't suggest making a movie out of this one.<br />Sorry I loved the rest but this book I could have done without.<br />I am really disappointed.
