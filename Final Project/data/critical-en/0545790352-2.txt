this book is great my kids and i are really enjoying it. But in Chapter 11 &#34;Quidditch&#34; there are some missing pages it goes directly from the cursed broomstick to harry almost swallowing the snitch. With no connection between the two events. This is a minor error but editing should have caught it. I'll post again if i see any other missing passages.
