This is where I started losing my interest a bit. This book reminded me of Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe, in that the main character, supposedly the heroine, spends most of the book disabled by PTSD and medication. Even though the final heroic act is hers again, it's hard to see her as the strong character in this last installment. She spends most of her time in a medical haze, or crying, or hiding in a closet.<br /><br />Katniss, now living in discreet, long-lost District 13, has to deal with the trauma of two Hunger Games and the weight of the liberation of Panem on her shoulders. Through her actions in the first book, she has become a symbol of rebellion used to rally the Districts against the Capitol. Much less happens in this third book than in the first two. There are a few battle scenes, and the final one, but otherwise, this book is much more introspective than the other two.<br /><br />But at the same time, this book is among the strongest example of the mental and physical consequences of war and violence on people. It is introspective because Katniss has reached her breaking point. She is exhausted, emotionally and physically, and cannot sustain more trauma. So the book becomes not so much about the liberation of Panem, but about Katniss' eventual, slow liberation from PTSD.<br /><br />The end, although satisfying on a character level, left me wanting on the world-level. We don't know what has happened to Panem, in the end. Is is better for Katniss' intervention, or has it remained the same? I think we're supposed to make a link between Katniss' and Panem's healing, but it's not as obvious as it should be.<br /><br />GENERAL THOUGHTS ON THE TRILOGY<br /><br />These books are rough. Brutal. They don't pull punches and describe war and violence without euphemisms. It's refreshing, in a sense, because it stands in stark contrast with the official-speak so condemned by George Orwell, back in the day. Collins, I'm sure, sees teenagers as able to handle the truth. She doesn't sugar-coat the horrifying acts of violence in both Games and the war.<br /><br />Although the books do live up to their hype, somehow, they don't live up to their potential. The world of Panem deserved much more development than it did. Maybe it's the fan of complex fictional social systems, &agrave; la Middlemarch, in me speaking, but I do think that the world of Panem could have been the site for a much deeper critique of the current state of power and capitalism. It's dystopian-we get it. But how did it become that way? What happened between now and then that the site of American power moved to possibly Colorado (I suspect Denver) and its social structure turned back to medieval times? I've read a lot of anticipatory science-fiction that gave enough information to infer how the world might crumble. Not so with The Hunger Games.<br /><br />All in all, it was a mostly satisfying read. It took me 3 days to read all of them, which makes them a quick and entertaining read. And I must admit I did cry at the end (or that might have been how tired and sick I felt. You'll never know, hah :p). My desire for a more complex world aside, considering the audience, I thought they were excellent examples of what the best YA literature can do.
