The present tense did not work for me because I thought it was poorly executed. Had it been written in past tense, I'd have given this book 4 stars. I found the overall writing a bit clunky. The story itself was extremely engaging, albeit predictable. I loved the characters, though. They had great motivations and acted consistently. I'd give this 3.5 stars if I could. I liked it but not as much as most other readers did. I won't be reading the rest of the series.
