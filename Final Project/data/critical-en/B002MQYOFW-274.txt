It basically felt like the author ran out of steam.<br /><br />Suddenly, Katniss finds herself caught up in a revolution that she neither understands nor can instinctively navigate. This sweeps the entire story into a sort of sci-fi techno gray zone (which leads to all sorts of questions about the evolution of Panem), where Katniss is portrayed as a sort of superhero and whereby there are huge leaps from one stage of the 'revolution' to the next. Snow is pure evil, Peeta has been brainwashed to hate Katniss, Katniss is turned into a propaganda weapon, Katniss has no idea what she wants or who she wants to be with, people die left and right (for no apparent reason, including the rebel leader Coin and Prim), the rebels march on the Capitol (unclear how) and sub-plots push each other constantly to the periphery.<br /><br />My firm impression is that the first book was in many ways great at struggle and character development, the second was a weak attempt to reinvent portions of the first book (another round of games, leading inexplicably to a rebel district 13 that is technologically advanced and armed to the teeth) and the third book was a really weak attempt to reach closure on the entire effort.<br /><br />I am honestly not sure that it was worth my time to have read all 3.
