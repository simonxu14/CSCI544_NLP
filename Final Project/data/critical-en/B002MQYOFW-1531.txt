I have been sucked into the Panem world after starting to read "Hunger Games", so I bought all three parts and read it till the end. This book is, however, too long for my taste - the action should've ended ca. in the middle of the book. I found it too made up in the end and that sort of happy ending was not really convincing. Apart from that, I loved the trilogy.
