Pretty big letdown rather than climax of the series. All those characters you fell in love with? Either gone, or not the same people they were. Yes, war is awful, but the reason we liked the The Hunger Games form the get-go was because we cared about the characters. By the end of Mockingjay, I didn't care anymore- just couldn't wait to be done with it. :(
