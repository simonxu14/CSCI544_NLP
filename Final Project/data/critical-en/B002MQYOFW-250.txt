At about the point that Katniss shot down a warplane with a bow and arrow, this book became completely unbelievable for me and I was reading it just to finish it.<br /><br />It's certainly dramatic.  Beloved characters die, dramatically.  Left and right.  But overall, the book just doesn't make sense.  Why plan your revolution around the winners of a television competition that doesn't involve any kind of battlefield strategy?  Why let teenagers in on your big strategy councils?  Why fight for a system of government that's even worse than the Capital's?  The motivations and strategies of the book's protagonists are confusing at best and nonsensical at worst.<br /><br />Added to the fact that I just can't root for the nation represented by the good guys, given its equally totalitarian nature when compared to the Capital, a lot of my enjoyment of this book was sapped.<br /><br />That said, it still has great action scenes and is a must-read if you want to complete the Hunger Games series.  But it's a disappointment compared to the first and second books, that's for sure.
