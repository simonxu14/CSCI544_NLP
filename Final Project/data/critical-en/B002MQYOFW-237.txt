I was looking forward to wrapping up the Hunger Games Trilogy, and just wondered how Collins was going to end her incredible series.<br /><br />The first 75% of the books was action-packed. A little gory, as usual, and just fast paced. I was really happy with how this book just took off from the beginning and wouldn't let go. Catching Fire, on the other hand, started slow and got better as it went along.<br /><br />Mockingjay started out fantastic, and ended with a ho-hum from me. I think the weakness of First Person Point of View is highlighted in the last 25% of this book. Without giving away too much, think about this - if your narrator is "out of commission" for whatever reason (knocked out, asleep, etc.), then your story pretty much is limited only to that character's waking moments.<br /><br />Apparently, a whole lot happened that the reader never gets to experience. With First Person, the writer is unable to weave subplots together, and secondary characters might get left behind or underdeveloped. Collins did an excellent job with these two innate weaknesses in the POV she chose to write in, but that final quarter of Mockingjay suffers terribly from being limited to only Katniss' perspective.<br /><br />Just a whole lot of telling instead of showing, which spells BORING. Some might hate the book because of the actual ending - but I think it's quite clever. The best way to end a book and make sure your fans are emotionally exploding at the end of your series is to give them a not-so-liked ending. So I don't have an issue with that at all.
