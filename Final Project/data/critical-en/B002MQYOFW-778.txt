I was all hyped up to read all 3 books and by the 2nd book I was already built up in anticipation of the finale. The end was anticlimactic and felt like an abrupt end to the excitement building up to it. The concept of the trilogy is interesting and made it difficult to put down. The ending just did not have the impact that the books plot had a potential for. Almost as if Ms Collins just ran out of mojo in the end and had to whip up the ending really quick. I think most of us feel that the main protagonist President Snow should have had a more satisfying final encounter with Katniss than what was penned. I did not feel any closure for Katniss.
