I don't usually jump on the "YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK!" bandwagon, but everyone I knew praised The Hunger Games to the heavens and I finally decided to check it out. Just a small preface before I begin this review, I am truly sad that I did not like this book. Shocked was more like it...<br /><br />1. The Writing<br /><br />Yes, this is a young adult novel, but my pragmatic approach to any book tells me I can't suspend reality for the most basic plot devices. Not only was the writing boring, but the clich&eacute;d lines had my eyes rolling more times than I can count.<br />Furthermore, I like books where the plot is explained subtly, not the vital repercussions concerning the harsh rules of the Capitol explained twenty times. For example:<br />"Taking the kids from our districts, forcing them to kill one another while we watch" &lt;-- this sentence should have sufficed and Collins' message will come across loud and clear. Yet, she continues--<br />"This is the Capitol's way of reminding us how totally we are at their mercy. How little chance we would stand of surviving another rebellion."<br /><br />The author holds your hand throughout the book, uncertain if you are capable of analyzing a basic plot. This is coming from attending a school that assigned preteens The Grapes of Wrath, Huckleberry Finn, Oliver Twist and The Giver .<br /><br />When Peeta constantly compliments Katniss, she says: "I don't know why, but this rubs me the wrong way."<br /><br />Along that, you can expect more lines such as "Betrayal. That's the first thing I feel". Maybe it's just me, but everything is so amateur.<br /><br />2. Character Development.<br /><br />Katniss, to me, is not a likable character. Her redeeming qualities are slim to none and she is downright rude. Nothing in the novel hints at me to believe that Katniss is really the "Chosen One". All I have to believe that Katniss will save the country of Panem is through passages--<br /><br />"She's a survivor"<br /><br />"People will help you in the arena. They will be tripping over each other to sponsor you."<br /><br />"She's excellent," says Peeta. "My father buys her squirrels. He always comments on how the arrows never pierce the body. She hits everyone in the eye."<br /><br />The only strong suit I see for Katniss' ability to win the Games is her use of the bow and arrow as shown in the above remark from Peeta's observations. If Katniss believed her only way to survive is through the bow and arrow, then what lesson has she MORALLY learned about staying alive? That if I don't have a bow and arrow, I am nothing? The bow and arrow is also a weapon, mind you. The games would have been more interesting had a bow and arrow never showed up. The author is indirectly telling me that my true gift lies in material.<br /><br />As the Gamemakers observe the tributes' training: "Several times I've looked up to find one fixated on me."<br /><br />And my favorite:<br />"She has no idea. The effect she can have."<br /><br />The inevitable effect she has on people is only clear to the characters in the book, because it is lost on me. It is not enough for Collins to insert remarks such as these in the novel and expect us to believe she will save the totalitarianism of a country. I wanted to see Katniss' growth as a character for me to understand the prophetic high remarks her colleagues give her. I don't need to read the third book to conclude she has realized potential.<br /><br />Katniss is rude and that's to say the least--<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />"I bite my lip and stalk back to my room, making sure Peeta can hear the door slam"<br /><br />Example:<br />As Katniss explains why she doesn't care to listen to the history of Panem, it's because<br />"Whatever the truth is, I don't see how it will help me get food on the table."<br /><br />The truth is what should help you fight against the system!<br /><br />My disappointment furthered, after this passage:<br /><br />"Suddenly I am furious that with my life on the line, they don't even have the decency to pay attention to me."<br />WAIT. Was this the moment she finally realized that she could possibly die and now she does the unthinkable and upsets the Gamemakers? Collins' writing suggests the Capitol is so strict. I find it hard to believe that Katniss can get away with this.<br /><br />The other characters are not only one-dimensional, but offer Katniss no further development. Peeta does nothing to better himself or Katniss in the arena. Haymitch, who is drunk 24/7 and could not even stand during the reaping, is alert during his drunkenness to send Katniss thought-provoking gifts. Give me a break.<br /><br />3. The Plot<br /><br />I was in no hurry to finish this book. Throughout the book, I never sensed Katniss in any real danger. She cheated death on several occasions (The tall, brutal, Thresh sparing her life because of Rue, Clove not killing her when she had the chance, the hellfire, one can even argue when she shot the arrow through the apple at the Gamemakers). Collins' plot is seen as way too convenient in favor of Katniss. No true sacrifice was made. Even when she took her sister's place, she still had a chance to battle it out.<br /><br />The "star-crossed" lovers sub plot felt like a thrown away brainstorm idea, rather than something making it to the final draft. As I read, I wondered how interesting of Collins to set up Peeta and Katniss' relationship during the Hunger Games, only allowing one to survive. The twist the Gamemakers announced halfway through the book felt so trivial, I laughed in disbelief.<br /><br />I will say that the book is fast-paced, which I like and the Hunger Games concept is interesting. Yet, my disappointment surpasses the slim margin of likeness I had toward The Hunger Games.
