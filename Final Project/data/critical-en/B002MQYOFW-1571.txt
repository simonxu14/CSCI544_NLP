This was my first audio book I have ever downloaded and listened to. The Hunger Games is not a type of book I would normally read but because of its popularity I figured it was a good experiment.<br />I have to say I really liked the experience of being read to and thought this reader did great. But as to the book itself I find it utterly disturbing that this book of &#34;voluntary murder&#34; by children under the shallow guise of government &#34;obligation&#34; would be such a popular topic for children. I also find it additionally disturbing that in an age when American children are actually killing each other in schools and on the streets this book encouraging such in their already confused minds has received no uprising of disfavor by anyone; Church, State, or Child Protection Agency. Add to that my surprise in finding such a book of mental confusion supporting the violence of murder by children would have been written by a young woman and I am simply dumbfounded. &#34;Go Katniss!&#34;
