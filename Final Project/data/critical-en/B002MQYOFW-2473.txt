The story is compelling and picks up steam about 1/3 through.  However, the prose is simplistic.  At times I felt like I was reading a books for tweens (maybe I was??).  The characters are immensely shallow, and there are quite a few inconsistencies.<br /><br />Still, I was entertained through the short, light adventure.
