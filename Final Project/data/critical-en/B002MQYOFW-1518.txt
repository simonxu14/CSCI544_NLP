I wanted to know what all the hype was, so I got the Hunger games on my kindle. I couldn't put it down, I wanted to see how it ended. I guess it was a good story, but the best I can say is to get out the prozac. So very depressing. All of the pain and sorrow. All of the young lives lost, for nothing more than entertaiment. What I didn't get was the total complience of everyone involved." Oh, ok, so I have to go kill people." I hate to think that this a is something that people think may happen to us soon. I hope that the younger children don't get the chance to see the movies, or to read the books. Nightmare makers for sure.
