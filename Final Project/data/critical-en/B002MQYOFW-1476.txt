I'm only halfway through this book, and I must say, the story and characters really have hooked me. What I must comment on, however, is the atrocious grammar. I'm surprised that no one else has mentioned it so far.<br /><br />While the book is written in present-tense, the author quite often randomly switches to past-tense, just for a sentence, then switches back. It is jarring. Also, she uses terrible sentence fragments in her descriptions, which could have easily been solved by the simple placement of a colon or a dash. The structure of her sentences is throwing me off so badly I can hardly enjoy the book; I suppose that is the curse of someone with an English Literature degree.<br /><br />Sadly, these things would have been solved by a good editor. I wonder how these dramatic errors in the very fabric of her style managed to slip by... or if this book was even edited at all.
