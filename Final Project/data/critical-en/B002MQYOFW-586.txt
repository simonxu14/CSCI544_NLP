~~~~~~~~~~<br />SPOILER ALERT!<br />~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />The first book is wonderful except for the ending (more on that in a sec). The premise of The Hunger Games and the post-USA society of Panem are compelling to say the least. The violence is handled well and without using kid gloves. Katniss begins the trilogy as a strong, capable female heroine that popular fiction needs more of.<br /><br />But, by not killing off a major character at the end of book 1 (you decide who), Collins writes herself into a love triangle-shaped hole that she spends an additional two books digging herself out of, never quite recovering. The second book spends so much time retreading the same ground as the first and doesn't really get going until well into the second hundred pages. Finally, the buildup to Mockingjay and Katniss's inability to embrace her heroic mantle were extremely unsatisfying. It became a story about a hero I didn't want to read about, a hero who would rather sulk in broom closets than do anything useful. Her final act of defiance was too little, too late in my opinion.<br /><br />The whole time I read this series I tried to bear in mind that this is young adult fiction and that I am not necessarily the target demographic. I really did. But there are some things that are just unforgivable in fiction, namely the insane amount of deus ex machina in these books and secondly the way Suzanne Collins writes in present-tense from only one character perspective. Writing in present tense is a trend that needs to stop and it is absolutely unforgivable in a world of this magnitude that we are stuck in Katniss's present perspective.  It's just not interesting and the only purpose for this limitation is so that you can rush the story along, without having to explain any of the ancillary details.<br /><br />This rushing pace is irritating for the most part but it works well in tense situations or moments of action. Seeing Katniss stalking prey through the forest, using her quick thinking and cleverness to trap other contestants, trying to keep pace with her companions through the jungle while avoiding numerous traps and pitfalls - these moments are gripping and totally readable. It's only when Collins tries to pull the camera back and increase the scope of her narrative that it falls flat. If all the characters aren't in one room, she just doesn't hold it together for me. I blame this entirely on the present tense style.<br /><br />I would also argue that Katniss was downright unreliable as a narrator by the end of the trilogy, because so many of the world-changing events were happening beyond her control.  Between being unconscious or paralyzed by indecisiveness most of the time, could it be so hard to introduce another perspective character at appropriate times? Perhaps we could hear a bit about how Gale is holding down the fort at District 12 while Katniss competes in the Games, or about Peeta as he struggles against the weapons of his torturers during his captivity, or about Haymitch and Plutarch politicking in District 13 while Katniss is recovering, or about the rebels fighting in the other districts? Perhaps fleshing out the characters a bit more would have made me care when almost all of the secondary ones introduced at the beginning of Catching Fire and Mockingjay were systematically killed off by the end of each book.<br /><br />While there is much wasted potential for discerning readers and a half-hearted ending that only barely fulfills the promises made by the previous plot points, the thing about this series that is commendable is its accessibility and the enthusiasm with which people read it. Nothing since the Harry Potter series seems to hold so many kids' and irregular adult readers' attention like The Hunger Games trilogy and everyone is talking about it, especially with the movie out now. For this reason alone I would recommend everyone check it out, as there are some interesting parallels that can be drawn to our present society. It is a good warm-up for young readers before books like Brave New World, Lord of the Flies and 1984 that some high school classes read.<br /><br />Finally, kudos to whoever is responsible for the great cover art and jacket design for this set. I love it and it looks great on a shelf.
