I was very disappointed with this book, and spent some time deliberating about giving it a two or a three.  Ultimately I chose the three, because despite its flaws, Mockingjay did offer a resolution, albeit a rather unsatisfactory one.<br /><br />My biggest problem with the book was that I felt like I lost all of the characters who had grown so dear to me since The Hunger Games.  I can't help but get the impression that in her push to publish the end of the trilogy, Collins lost her way.  Katniss is a shadow of her usual self, and because the book is told from her point of view, the story suffers drastically.  Collins also uses a lot of quick images and half sentences, especially towards the end of the book, in a breathy pace that speaks more to an author rushing towards the end than to the character's state of mind.<br /><br />You will find a resolution in this book, and it is bittersweet enough that you don't feel completely cheated.  It is nice to have an ending, but I wish this ending had been told differently.  In fact, I sort of wish Collins would come back out with Mockingjay, Version II ... but I find that unlikely.<br /><br />I'm sure people have delivered enough plot synopses that I don't need to go through the paces of saying what is what, but merely stick with what I felt was book's strongest failing point: we lose Katniss as a character, she becomes a deadened puppet, two-dimensional, and frustratingly selfish.  I felt that this was less Collins' attempt to show how Katniss was coping with the world around her, and more her inability to handle the complexity of emotions Katniss was suffering.<br /><br />That being said, you should read the book to finish the trilogy.  And you should read the first two books because they're so well done, so full of the talent and intricacies that Collins did not show in this third book.  I don't warn readers away from the last installment, but I do warn them to be prepared for a finish that does not do justice to the trilogy, to Collins, or to Katniss.
