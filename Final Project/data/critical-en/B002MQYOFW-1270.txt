This book takes place in an area that used to be the US.  However, now it is broken into 12 districts and ruled by the "Capitol."  Formerly, there had been 13 districts, but that district was destroyed during an unsuccessful rebellion by all of the districts.  Now in a punishment that could only have been imagined by Shirley Jackson, the Capitol requires the remaining 12 districts to draw the name of a boy and girl from each district each year to participate in the Hunger Games.  In the Hunger Games, each contestant must kill all of the other contestants until only one is left standing.  This book is told from the point of view of a contestant from one of the poorer districts, Katniss.<br /><br />The book is certainly a page-turner (I finished it in one day), and although the subject matter is inherently violent, the book does not dwell on the specifics.  So, why didn't I give the book five stars?  The reason is that when I got to the end, even though I knew this was the first book of a trilogy and the story has not finished, I was surprised to find that I didn't feel the desire to buy the next book.  Although it was an interesting book, I just didn't feel drawn enough into Ms. Collins's world or to the characters to worry about how the story ultimately turns out.  In sum, this certainly is an entertaining way to spend a few hours, but ultimately not satisfying enough to make me go back for more.
