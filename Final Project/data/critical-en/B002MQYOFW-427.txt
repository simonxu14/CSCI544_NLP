While I enjoyed the series I found that it was ultimately a rather depressing story, but an incredibly relevant political/historical one.  I find myself taken aback by the current obsession with the series, especially given it's incredibly violent undertones.  I am also somewhat concerned that it is classified as young adult literature, as I think it might be too mature for younger readers.  While I would recommend it to others, I would certainly advise parents whose children are reading this novel to have a discussion as to the political and societal implications of what is happening in the story.  That said, it's much more realistic as to character development and feelings than one usually finds in a fantasy/science fiction novel.  The characters are flawed and present a wide range of human emotions which evolve over time due to the circumstances to which they're subjected.  The author does not shy away from the cruelties and realities of the human conditions and the horrible lows they are capable of, I do however wish there were more of the incredible highs included as well.
