To many readers, myself included, Collins' characters are dimensional, colorfully human, and highly believable, until they are thrown around carelessly in "Mockingjay." The relationships and character dynamics barely hold themselves together, and, being weak, are only hungry to crawl through the thick of the pages in this third book to then wrap their quarrels up quickly and hurriedly through the last few pages of the series. The detailed notes and depictions of the relationships in The Hunger Games and Catching Fire (particularly between Katniss and Peeta) were depicted well and helped readers fall in love with this series, but could not have been more dryly lain out for the reader in this 'conclusive' book. You will receive an ending--a fairly understandable one--but you will leave this book wishing for a lot more, and most likely written by a fan, who in my opinion, could do a much better job in giving readers the conclusion they can better hold onto and ponder for the following years as Collins headed her readers into numb, blurry, and unneeded territory. A lot of what is unnecessary is here. Most of what you want from leaving Katniss and her story is not.
