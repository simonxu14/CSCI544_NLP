I loved the book.. But a waste of money buying it at Amazon the only thing I didn't like about it was.. I bought it to put on my e-book reader to read while at lunch at work.( which is compatible with all e-book formats) only to find out that it wouldn't open on the reader( I tried contacting Amazon about this issue and never got response to my problem) and if I wanted to read it on an e-book reader I would have to purchase an Amazon Kindle. So I bought the book from Barnes and Noble only to find the same issue was with their books as well. I ended up having to go down to the library and check it on for e-book readers. IN my opinion don't waste your money buying the e-book from amazon or Barnes and noble unless you own a kindle or nook just go to the library and check it out. They have it in a variety of formats and works seamlessly with all e-book readers and can be gotten just as fast on your computer all you need is your library card.<br />Otherwise the book is great.. definitely read it.
