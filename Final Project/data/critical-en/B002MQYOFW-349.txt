This is a review of the Hunger games series. If you have read the first two there is no reason why you should stop here. I best describe the hunger games as Game of thrones stripped of 10 of the 12 layers. It is a light quick read with little depth. If you are looking for fantasy with depth move over to the game of thrones series. Buy a kindle as you dont want to lug around those books and make sure to start fan mail requesting that George Martin finish the series!
