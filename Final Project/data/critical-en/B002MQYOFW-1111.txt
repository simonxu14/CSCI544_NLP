I did know anything about this book until I was in the airport ready for a flight to Caracas when I saw a special issue of the Hunger Games in a People magazine. After that I decided I wanted to read it before the movie arrives. I barely had an idea of what it was about. I knew that the author was inspired from channel surfing on television (reality shows and the invasion of Iraq). That really called my attention. At the begining it was a little bit slow, but the information is useful to understand the hunger games world, but once the Games start I couldn't take it down. The end of this first book leaves you with a huge willing of reading the next one right away.
