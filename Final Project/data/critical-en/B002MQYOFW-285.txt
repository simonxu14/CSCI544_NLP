This 3rd book was a big let down.  It seemed as though Suzanne Collins did not have enough time or pages to explore/develop the many different angles she introduced.  I felt like the book was 'all over the place' and did not flow. It was a big let down.  I know that 2 times in the Games would be enough to drive anyone crazy - but did everyone have to be so unstable? I found myself flipping ahead because certain scenes were entirely too long and did not keep my interest.  The first 2 books made me not want to skip a single letter.  This book made it impossible to read every sentence...?
