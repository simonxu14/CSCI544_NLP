I really enjoyed the first 4 Harry Potter books, but I was very dissapointed in this book. What kept me reading was that I kept thinking that it would get better and I wanted to know who died. I missed so many of my favorite characters that had limited exposure in this story line. I also did not like the way the 15 year old Harry acted most of the time. Hopefully number 6 and 7 will be better.
