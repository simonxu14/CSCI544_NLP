I have looked forward to Mockingjay's release for months....and I can't emphasize how much it disappointed me.  Nothing turned out like I expected, and from start to finish the book was just kind of depressing.  I enjoy reading fiction because it takes me to "another" world and most of the time leaves me with a happy feeling.  Not so with Mockingjay.<br /><br />Spoilers.....<br /><br />First, I was disappointed that Madge was killed off essentially before the book even began.  I had hoped that her character would be developed, etc---and I had hoped for a future Madge/Gale romance.  I thought that was perhaps hinted at when Madge treked through the snow to bring Gale morphling in book 2.  I was also disappointed that Gale's family never really made an appearance.<br /><br />Second, I was disappointed in the entire Peeta storyline.  I REALLY loved Peeta's character in the first two books and with the hijacking scenerio his character was virtually non-existent.  I had hoped to see a gradual development of a Peeta/Katniss relationship but the book barely focused on that at all---instead it focused on more depressing matters.<br /><br />Third, I was disappointed with how both Gale and Katniss handled their relationship/friendship at the end regarding Prim's death.  Gale was a major character and just to say he was off in another district with a good job was not enough for me.  I also did not like how Katniss was once again virtually abandoned by her mother.<br /><br />Fourth, I didn't like the way the rebellion ended.  I didn't think that Snow roaming around his rose garden was realistic for a criminal of his stature.  I also didn't like how Katniss and Haymitch voted yes for a future Hunger Games....and I didn't like how Katniss murdered Coin.  Did I dislike Coin?  Yes, of course.  But did I like the "heroine" of the novel murdering her?  No.  I would have liked Katniss exposing Coin for who she was instead and bringing her to justice....but that would have required a longer book---which would have been fine with me.  The Twilight Saga's "Breaking Dawn" was super long and it did fine.  I think Collins would have been better served making Mockingjay longer and filling in more of the gaps that were left in the story.<br /><br />There are a zillion other things I didn't like about the book---and it may perhaps be at least partially attributed to the fact I have read a few good fanfiction stories that went in an entirely different direction than Collins.  In this book, Collins writing seemed disjunct and at times rambling.  It seemed almost as if she was on a tight deadline and just had to get something on the paper.  I apologize for this overly critical review---I just really was disappointed in this book---from start to finish.  The first third of the book was even to the point of boring to me....and I had figured it would be a page turner like the others were for me.
