I loved the first book. I liked the second book . I am disappointed in the way this book started and ended. I expected a little more character maturity from Katniss. I can only assume the author wanted to get her point across about the horrors of war and what it does to us.  I just expected Katniss to rise above it all.  Good reading though I just didn't like how it ended.
