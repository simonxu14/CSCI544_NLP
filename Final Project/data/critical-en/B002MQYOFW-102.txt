While I'm an adult and usually read adult fiction, the first 2 books in this series were very enjoyable...This final book was not. Far too many ridiculous plot turns and contrivances, far too many pages spent on a poorly executed love triange, far too much boring and tired introspection on Katniss' part. In short, the author really flubbed this one...but maybe if you're 12 yrs old and hooked into series, the faults won't be so glaring.
