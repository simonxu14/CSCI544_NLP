The second book left off with a horrible cliff-hanger with Katniss being removed from the Hunger Games stadium before the games were even completed.<br /><br />Katniss finds herself awaking in the hospital and discovers she is now in District 13, a District which does really exist.  And much to her great sorrow, most of District 12 and most of its inhabitants have been killed as the Capitol goes on its quest to subdue all of the districts, destroying the ones who do not obey.<br /><br />Katniss' family has escaped and her best friend, Gale, is safe too, but the boy she was beginning to fall for, Peeta, was not rescued from the stadium at the games, and now he is being tortured and controlled by The Capitol as a weapon, one which they intend to use directly against Katniss.<br /><br />Katniss discovers the rebellion and learns of its plans to overthrow the Capitol, and to begin by gaining control of each district one-by-one.  And it is Katniss.  Katniss Everdeen that they choose to have as their leader, their symbols, their Mockingjay.  The sight of which brings strength and power to all those who see her.<br /><br />And yet Katniss is torn apart, tortured by the thought of what is happening to Peeta and destroyed by the new control under which she finds herself and her life.  Overwhelmed by guilt that but-for her, most of District 12 would still be alive...<br /><br />Will the rebellion be successful in convincing Katniss to be their symbol?  And will Katniss have the strength to cooperate?  And what of Peeta, locked up in the Capitol and being tortured by President Snow in order to break Katniss?  Will their efforts be successful, or is there something much, much, much more sinister at work?<br /><br />Read Mockingjay to find out!<br /><br />Definitely the least favorite of the 3 books in my opinion.<br /><br />Katniss is basically completely broken, and you no longer see the strong young woman, the one who volunteered as tribute to save her baby sister.  Instead it's all self-pity, self-loathing, and more self-pity.  It makes it hard to empathize with her.<br /><br />Yes, she's been through more than any of us can have imagined.  1.5 hunger games, and seeing the man she loves locked up and knowing he's being tortured.  But she's so self-pitying it's almost hard to read.<br /><br />It took me a lot longer to finish this book than it did for me to finish the other two.  The first two I almost couldn't put down!  And when the second ended on such a cliffhanger, I couldn't help but start the 3rd immediately.<br /><br />Maybe there's something in me that always hates seeing a good series end (ask me how I feel about the epilogue in Harry Potter #7) but I really think it's more than that with this book.  Mockingjay just simply isn't as good, isn't as captivating and isn't as compelling.<br /><br />We meet a few more interesting characters, see a lot of the same old ones, and the tired attempts at twists just don't quite do it for me.<br /><br />And yet, if you've read this much of the series you really should finish the third.<br /><br />All in all for this book alone, 3 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />For the series as a whole though, 4 out of 5, largely carried by the first book, The Hunger Games.
