I did not like the book. I watched the movies. Rather than wait to see how it ended I choose the book. It's very wordy, so much that I kept falling asleep. Inventing ways to kill people is not new but it is boring when it just keeps happening in droves. After all it's a novel, war is hell and as long as we have people who thirst for power we will always have war. Also we could see Coin going down fairly early she was too much like Snow. Lastly I'm not much for magic arrows etc.
