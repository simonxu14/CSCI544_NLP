All three books are brutal in their violence and psychological injury to the characters, but about half way through the final installment becomes dull in its execution. Far too much of the book is focused on lengthy depictions of the lead character's nightmares and delusions. Ultimately, the reader is left with the sense that the surviving characters are too damaged to ever function again and the vague epilogue does little to resolve the impression. A disappointing ending following two excellent volumes.
