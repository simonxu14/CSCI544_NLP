I was very upset with the product I received.  After opening and beginning to listen to the CDs I realized that I had two copies of disk 2 and none of disk 3.  This error should not have occurred.  I would hope that a copy of disk 3 would be sent to me at no charge since I have already paid for the entire book.  No one would buy a book if part of it was missing.  It is the same expectation should be applied to audio books.
