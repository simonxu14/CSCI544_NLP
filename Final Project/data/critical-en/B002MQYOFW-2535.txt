After blasting through The Hunger Games and Catching Fire in days (or less), I was surprised to find myself dragging through this book. The first 3/4 of the book was not exciting and, at times, flat out boring. The last 1/4 of the book isn't so bad and the conclusion is satisfactory.<br /><br />All in all, I felt this book severely lacked the imagination and excitement of the first two books.
