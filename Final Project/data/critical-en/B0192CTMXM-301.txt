Bought as gift for wife. Sent by UPS to deliver on D-Day. But it hands off to the post office who, of course, delivers it3 days late. Thanks Amazon. They refunded my money and sent another book. Wanna buy one? UPS ONLY !! that's why we don't use the post office. that's why UPS exists. The book was really a good read. Boring inparts as she writes like she's getting paid by the word.
