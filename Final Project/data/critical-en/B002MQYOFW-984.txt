Again in the third book of the series I find myself riveted through most of the book, the emotional struggles Katniss goes through are relate-able if not heart breakingly honest. As with the first two however, the ending fizzled, leaving me feeling like an emotional unresolved mess, I thought the little future glimpse at the end was a stretch to find an ending to an otherwise brilliant book.
