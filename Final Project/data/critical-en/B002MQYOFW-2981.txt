This book was ok I know this is aimed toward kids/teens. Im in my 20s and read it, first I will say to all the parents out there the violence in this book is crazy sort of like a horror type stuff..goes into details.. I would not let a kid read it, its disturbing imo. If you care what your kid reads might want to pass on this, if you dont care  skip this warning.<br /><br />The book was ok imo, I feel like the story is tooooooooooooo long when it shouldnt have to be in this case, I did get into it tho..I kept wondering whats going to happen next. I did get bored towards the end of the book (since its not and ending story) I did not enjoy all the Graphic violence/gore...<br />so heres my thoughts on the book the start was cute, the middle was creepy, and the end just was flat.<br />I know I can buy another book to continue but the ending didnt grip me so I dont care for it.
