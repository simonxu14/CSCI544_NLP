I thought the lead in to the final chapter on this trilogy was great.  I could not wait to read it.  The build up throughout the book itself kept me going feverishly.  It all faded away quickly toward the end.  The ending left much to be desired and the final decision by the &#34;Mockingjay&#34; left me perplexed.  I did not feel that it went along with her character at all, which was the most disappointing part.  I am no writer, so I indulge on the creativity of others.  I think the lack of creativity in the ending did an injustice to the great amount of creativity in the set up.
