This book was just okay and was probably my least favourite of the three. You have to read it after Catching Fire since that book leaves so much unfinished but there are parts where the book drags. I like that the "good guys" - the Rebels - have some complexity; they're not all good to the Capitol's evil. I also liked the strength of the female characters in this book. I didn't like how Katniss was written in this one. I found her inner dialogue to be so self-pitying that it was almost irritating and it did little to further the plot of the book.
