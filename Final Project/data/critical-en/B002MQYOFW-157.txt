This is most definitely my least favorite of the 3 books in the trilogy.<br /><br />The first 330 pages Draaaaaagged.  On.  Forever.<br /><br />I wanted so badly to just skip to the last chapter to see how it ended.<br /><br />It felt like the author spent way too much time and energy writing about how the Rebels were setting up opportunities to make silly war propaganda videos, and she didn't have any energy left to properly end the series.<br /><br />In most of the key moments, Katniss was not there, so the reader just got a recap of what happened.  For example, towards the end when they are in front of President Snow's building and the parachute bombs go off, she completely misses a raid on the building, so the reader misses out on all those heart-stopping moments too.  Katniss (and the reader) were just given a brief recap of what happened while she was in the hospital or something.<br /><br />This book had at least 2 or 3 big misses like that, which is very disappointing.  I never once felt my heart pound at some major action happening which made no sense because this is the "BIG SHOW"... the rebellion... everything that we've been working up to, and it was a major let-down.  I almost would have been happier if they just put all the rebels in an arena with President Snow for a fun show-down!  That probably would have been more interesting to read about.<br /><br />The ending for me was also disappointing.  Collins spent too many pages writing about the lame propaganda videos and didn't take the time to properly wrap up the story.  I am happy that the storyline ended the way I hoped it would since the very beginning, but it was disappointing that she wrote about it in a couple of paragraphs.  By the third book, I was emotionally invested in the characters... I wanted more details of *how* they reached that ending... not that the ending just happened.  It will be interesting to see how this third book translates to film.  I am kind of hoping they don't base it TOO much on "Mockingjay" because then the audience might fall asleep :(
