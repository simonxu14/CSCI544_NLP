I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books in the series of The Hunger Games. The author should've stopped right there because it seems she was scraping the barrel for substance to fill the last book.Not only was the outcome predictable, the content of the book could've been condensed and included in the second book. The author wanted this to be a trilogy it seems, no matter what, and therefore the last book served only to describe brutality so repetitively that it became mundane and boring. I simply skipped whole chapters just to get to the end. The &#34;happily ever after&#34; ending was, to put it bluntly, nauseating. Couldn't wait to shut the Kindle.
