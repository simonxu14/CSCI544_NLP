I liked the first book. The second was kind of a letdown. The problem with the third book was that it was an inevitable fail. If you liked the dynamics of the first book, the third is nothing like it. However, the setup of the first book, the oppressive capitol, the uprising of the people, demanded some kind of resolve of the force behind the hunger games. I realize that we must address the overthrow of the capitol, but the intrigue and cunning of the first book was lost in translation by the time the third book came around. I found myself skimming through many pages of this book because I was so BORED. I agree with other reviewers when they say that this book seems to be like a bad storytelling by a colleague trying to tell a ghost story at a company retreat. It was WOW this happened, and then THIS HAPPENED, and then, and then, and so on. The ending seemed lackluster and improbable, inconsistent with the rest of the story. And what happened to Primrose? It seems as though her role was an afterthought just slid into the story once the writer realized she forgot to address this plot point. Bottom line, you will want to read it to get closure on the story, but you will be ultimately disappointed once you're through.
