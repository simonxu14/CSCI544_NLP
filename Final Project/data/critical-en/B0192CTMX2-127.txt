Admittedly, I'm older that the target audience by at good 30 years, but I truly enjoyed the first four books in the Harry Potter series. However, my attention was starting to wander by page 700 of this tome due to the length, slower pace, and the unrelenting teen angst of Harry--a character who had managed to remain relatively cheery through his travails till now. I will say that the unpleasant ending most definitely snagged my attention once again.<br />Perhaps it's simply that I was enjoying the saga as escapist fare and not identifying closely with the characters as some of the younger audience are said to do. The tone of this book is decidedly moodier than the rest, and to be blunt--not what I was looking for. I'm sure many fans will love the book but many of the children and adults I've talked to echo my complaints, though not often to the same degree. Several writer-types said they thought the book needed editing.<br />Bottom line. I read then reread the first four in short order. I've had no such desire with the fourth and it's instilled a "wait and see" attitude in me towards the last two installments. If Ms. Rowland again opts for a darker mood, I'll pass. I can get all the realism I need reading the newspapers.
