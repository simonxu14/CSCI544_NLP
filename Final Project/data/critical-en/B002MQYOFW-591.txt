The first book creates a strong note, you are introduced to a surreal after-civilization (kind of modern Roman empire) scene where every year &#34;chosen&#34; youth has to fight against each other for their survival in a carefully designed huge studio with lots of danger. It is quite shocking and it is very easy to learn to love our main character girl who of course will win (and you know  it since it is a trilogy and the same girl is the narrator of the events). The strange, at the same time cruel and childish (just look at those Capitol adults) world resembles a fairy tale kind of realm.<br />I really liked the first book, I must tell.<br />I was however dissapointed a bit in the following two volumes, as I felt that the logic injured during the journey.  I loved however some turns of events: e.g. the final game of selecting former winners as the emperor (call him president if you wish) finds out the former and celebrated winners are a threat to his rule.<br /><br />I think overall it is an OK book, but probably means more stars if you belong to the youngsters and love fantasy literature.
