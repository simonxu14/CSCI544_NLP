By the time I got through these three books, I had to admit they were a pretty good indictment of current society, plastic, uncaring, affected, and viciously materialistic.  I didn't like the books though (or the movie).  The characters seemed a little two-dimensional and the plot lacked that fundamental connection to realism that makes fantasy actually really work.  Although there were plenty of worthwhile parables and metaphors for contemplation, I just didn't find the entire universe of this fantasy believable enough to make it rise above the level of &#34;meh&#34;.
