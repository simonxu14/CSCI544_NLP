Where were Suzanne Collins editors when she wrote this book? Too many loose ends. Too rushed. Characters weren't at all like they had been in the previous two books. The point that Suzanne Collins was trying to make was that war can ruin people. But, what she fails to grasp, is that although war leaves scars, it also can bring out the best of people. Courage. Strength. And hope for a better future.<br />This book left me empty.<br />I love her other books, The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. But this book just doesn't fit in the trilogy.
