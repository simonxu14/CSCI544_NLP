I read The Hunger Games quickly and enjoyed the unusual premise of the book. I went through it quickly, on to the second book, and then to the third. I should have stopped at the first one. This last book was a struggle just to get through, and I was glad when it was finished. The characters all fell flat, the plot seemed weak, there was very little real connection between characters, and a pathetic conclusion. At the crescendo of the final battle the main character gets hit and passes out in pain? This just read like a two dimensional war story that simply dribbled out at the end.
