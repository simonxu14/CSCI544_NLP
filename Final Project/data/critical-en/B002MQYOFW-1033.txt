Well it's a fine book but you know what is going to happen since there are more books and a few other things(I will not mention to avoid spoilers) but it focuses on keeping you from realizing what will happen, even though it doesn't work. So I wish it focused on what was happening more then the out come for 70% of the book. But I did enjoy the book and it won't be disappointing and I might be bias but I read it fine.
