I was disappointed by the conclusion to this great series. I felt like it was anti-climatic, particularly at the end. She could have spent an additional 100 pages building the love triangle. At one point, I read about 30 pages waiting for the "and then she woke up from her dream" clause. Obviously if you've read the other two, you have to read this one. I just wish the author had taken more time to build the story. I would rather have waited another couple of months to get a better conclusion.
