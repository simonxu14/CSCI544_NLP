maybe my expectations were too high, when I started reading this book. From the word-of-mouth reviews I had heard, I guess I was expecting something of the calibre of Harry Potter..<br /><br />the book starts off very well..a bit slow in the beginning, but picks up speed as we go along..<br /><br />but towards the later part, there are a few &#34;slips&#34; - unanswered behavior, predictable events, other characters behaving too conveniently for the protagonist, rather than according to their vested interests, etc.. some scenes also felt very drawn out - far too much drama and far too much introspection for my liking..<br /><br />read it once -  but don't think I would re-read it ever..<br /><br />read the reviews of the next book in the series - Gale was probably the only character I would have liked to read about and explore more - and that would have been the motivation to read the next book - but the reviews seemed to indicate that that character did not get much spotlight in the next book, and that some of the introspection seems to be repeated - so will be skipping the remaining books of the series..
