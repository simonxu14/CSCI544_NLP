The first book was phenomenal!  I couldn't put these books down, I have to give Suzanne Collins credit for that.  The first book had me hooked for the last two.  However, the last two books were a huge letdown.  The second and third books slowly lose excitement, passion, and chemistry as they dwindle down into a lackluster ending that doesn't make any sense.  I was severely disappointed when I put down Mockingjay...
