When I was first told about The Hunger Games, I never in a million years thought that I would like this book. I'm not a big fan of killing and sad stories. Especially children killing children. However, as morbid as it sounds, I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />To start off, I loved the writing. I love books with a lot of suspense in them, and this one nailed it. The writing drew me in, and I was unable to put it down. I just had to find out what happened next. I was also happy with the fact that it wasn't terribly gruesome (I don't like blood and guts and gore too much).<br /><br />I also loved the characters. I was afraid for them, cried for them, at some points I even wished I was them (I am a sucker for romance, I have to admit, and Peeta's character was rather appealing to me).<br /><br />Now to the sad part. The reason that I only gave it three stars. The first reason is, I really don't like the idea of brutality and children killing children. I prefer happier subjects to be honest. My visualization skills are excellent, and I hate to see a twelve year old die in my head.<br /><br />Also, some of the dialogue and story choices didn't make too much sense to me. In the beginning, the way the author writes sounds almost forced, but that eventually goes away within the first few chapters. Another example is the part with the [ fallen tribute dog mutations in the end. It didn't make sense to me, wasn't well explained (did the dogs embody the fallen tributes' souls? did they have their eyes? I just didn't get it), and it seemed kind of thrown in there. I would have preferred Katniss or Peeta to have killed Cato directly, over these dog things.
