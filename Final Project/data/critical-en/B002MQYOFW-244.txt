After reading the first two books I was really hungry for this one.  However, Mockingjay left me a little disappointed and a little frustrated.<br /><br />*** SPOILERS ***<br /><br />Katniss acts a little spoiled.  District 13 rescued a lot of other people, and none of the others require the President to make them special promises in front of an assembly of the whole district.  Beetee and Finnick don't act like that; they just get to work.  To be sure, Katniss carries a lot of damage (but so does everybody else).  For me, Katniss crossed the line when she saw evidence of President Snow's movements in the first chapter, but didn't tell anyone else.  Throughout the book, she is fighting her own revolution, and not working well with others.<br /><br />There's not enough Haymitch, not enough Beetee, not enough Gale.  Even -- not enough Effie, and I don't even like her!<br /><br />The ending is both rushed and inconclusive.  What is Katniss's relationship with her mother at the end?  Did they just stop talking to each other?!  Did Katniss and Haymitch ever sit down and clear the air?
