The book is pretty good by itself. But in term of the last book in its trilogy, it is an disappointment! The author had created wonderful characters in the first and the second book. However, all of such excellent characters became dull and bored in the Mockingjay. It seems the author had big struggles in finding the way to develop the story. Was she in rush of fishing the book on time? I'd rather waiting another year to read a better book!
