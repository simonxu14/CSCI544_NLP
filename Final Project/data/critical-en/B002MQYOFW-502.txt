I love to read series books of different genre. I must say, I heard about this series through my friends and the media.<br />I was getting mixed opinions and reviews about the story... Therefore I was contemplating to read this series.  I ended up renting the first move to see what the hype was about. It was good so I took a chance and read the last two books. Upon completing the series, I can honestly say this was the first story series that I am not impressed with at all. This story moves around too much... There is too much information crammed into this book, leaving the reader to be confused. I found the ending of this series to be very unsatisfying.
