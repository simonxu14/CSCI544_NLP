I just wanted to say that I hope this review convinces the store to ship heavy hard cover books in a box. The corners on mine were damaged. I planned on keeping this book as a collectible, but its not. Its also not worth the hassle to send it back and get another one over mashed corners. The book came in just an envelope, and its a big book, the last Harry Potter book in fact. The size and weight of the book tore through the envelope. The corners of the envelope were actually missing. They could have at least TAPED the corners...
