I was compelled to read Mockingjay since I had read the previous 2 stories in the trilogy. I have to say that I was quite bored with it. The only thing that kept me in it was because I did need to know how it ended. I found it to be very redundant. Too much of the same thing over and over and after a while I just felt that the story line was cluttered.
