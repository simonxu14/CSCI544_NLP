Like others, I struggled to finish this book.  It did not hold my attention like the previous two books.  I felt like the author started to dabble too much in an area that she wasn't comfortable enough with or knowledgeable of and the result was a book with less direction and authenticity.  The entire book felt like it was written by someone in a rushed fashion.  With that said, I thought the ending was fine.  I did find it interesting that the author just wrote Gale off, but I suppose it is her book.  There could not realistically be a fairy-tale ending with the events that took place. I just wish the book was more well-written.
