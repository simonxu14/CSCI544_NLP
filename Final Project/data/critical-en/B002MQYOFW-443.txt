The ending stank.<br /><br />SPOLIERS<br /><br />SPOLIERS<br /><br />Gale is the only character that completes his arc. Peeta and Katniss...I mean...do nothing.<br /><br />Katniss never takes control, never REALLY embraces who she is. She never catches fire. She doesn't kick anyone's ass, she doesn't really learn to stand on her own two feet. She just kind of lets everyone else push her left and right. It would have been wonderful to see her and Peeta kind of switching roles.<br /><br />And good lord! All the foreshadowing of Peeta being an amazing public speaker and you never, ever let him evolve into a leader of any sort? He would have been a great foil for Gale.<br /><br />Fail, fail, fail.<br /><br />What was with the trial at the end? I mean...uggg!
