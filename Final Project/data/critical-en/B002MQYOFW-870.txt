For perspective: I thought the first book was brilliant, the second not quite as good but still very good.<br /><br />This one is okay but nowhere near the first two. Some action sequences toward the back half of the book simply fall flat and I had to endure them rather than enjoy them. It's tough to write such scenes and make them "believable enough", and the author doesn't manage it here; everything feels contrived and strange. By the end of the story, though, the book recovers, and it was worth sticking with it to the end.<br /><br />Some reviewers have gone off on "anti-war propaganda" and various other weird accusations. I didn't pick any of that up. For the most part the characters pretty much were themselves.
