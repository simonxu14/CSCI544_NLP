I am definitely not a Hunger Games fan. To be brief; the main character Katniss lacks development, which caused a sense of apathy in me toward her and her story. The action parts are decent enough, but there are really only two characters in the whole thing that I actually felt compelled by. Mine is not the majority opinion, most of the people who recommended this series to me absolutely love them, but I have definitely read far better.
