I'd give the author two stars on her story telling technique, but her imagination raises it to three. I realize she is writing to a young audience, but does she have to dumb it down it so much?<br />The characters aren't particularly believable. The horrors are imaginative, but not fleshed out enough to be really scary. The scenes lack content and life. I couldn't picture the settings based on her lack of descriptions.<br />I think a good screenwriter and director could improve on the material significantly as they did in the movie version of The Hunger Games. I look forward to seeing it on the Screen.
