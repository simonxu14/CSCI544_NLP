Finishing the book in 2 days made me think it was good, but the more I go over the story, the weaker it appears.<br /><br />We have this omnipotent government plucking children from their homes to fight to the death while the rest of the nation watches on tv, and there is no protest whatsoever. Mothers would rather lose their children than intervene? No rebellion by the masses? Or what, the government kills them? Civil disobedience, anyone?<br /><br />Anyway, there are these 24 kids, which, sorry, 24?? How many are even named in the book? 7? And almost all of them are killed "off-screen" meaning Katniss, the main character, is not involved. She is busy eating (seriously, every other page) or faking a romance for personal gain. Nice guy Peeta has rescued her multiple times, often to his own detriment, but she can only pretend to like him. So that part was actually pretty realistic.<br /><br />Surprisingly to me, the audience goes gaga over Katta (Peeniss?) so the rulers take a break from oppressing everyone and decide, for the first time ever, 2 kids can survive The Hunger Games! Later they reverse their decision, only to change it a 3rd time at the very end--great writing, I know--and I'm told the way they were "forced" to spare the young lovers angered the government so much that they come after Katniss in the next 2 books but I'll never know for sure because bleh.
