Collins concludes the Hunger Games series with Mockingjay that sees the climax of the Districts' war on the Captitol and features Katniss, Peeta, Gale and others former Tributes as the key players in the battles that occur.  Mockingjay offers gripping action and developments and continues the elaboration of all the characters that make the series so intriguing.  The story includes some events that ring too fantastical to be consistent with the mainline plot. Readers will eagerly read through to the end in suspense to see how the story ends and how the characters live or die.  This book is adequate but not overly satisfying; however, it is definitely worth the read.
