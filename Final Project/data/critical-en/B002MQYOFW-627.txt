The first two books were the best. I rated this one 3 stars because when I finished the book it left me very emotional. She was so broken and sad and dying inside and out that It just made me not like it. Also Suzanne Collins has this writing problem she will start a sentence midway and then when the story is supposed to be written all from Katniss' perspective she will switch like for a minute your in someone else's mind. This book was my least favorite of the trilogy and I think she could have made a bit of a happier ending. I hope you find this review helpful.
