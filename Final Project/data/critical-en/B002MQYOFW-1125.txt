I gave this a three star rating because I was almost disappointed in this book. In fact, it was so sad and defeating that at times I felt myself telling myself "I can't wait until this is over" and constantly pushing myself to keep reading. I really enjoyed the first two books and I'm not sure what I was expecting out of this book, but it didn't meet them.
