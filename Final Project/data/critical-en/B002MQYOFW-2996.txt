I think the author should do a "do over" and give loyal fans of her first two books the final book in the trilogy we've been waiting for.  It's like she was rushing through, just trying to get something written and totally forgot how to write and develop the story.  She turned the lead characters into a bunch of unlikeable victims rather than unforgettable heroes.  Totally unsatisfying ending, VERY DISAPPOINTED.  I will hesitate to recommend any of the books due to the way it ends.  Not just the actual ending, but the entire third book which was a complete waste of time and money.  I would give it zero stars if I could.
