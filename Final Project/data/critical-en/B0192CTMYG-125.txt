The book arrived in two pieces.  The spine of the book was broken into two parts, held loosely together by the cover.  When opened, it fell into two parts.  I have purchased books for many years from Amazon and this is the first book that was not as promised.  The low price of the book negates any return, etc.  This was a replacement purchase on my part after someone borrowed my copy. ( It had sentimental value as I had stood in line at Barnes and Noble, after midnight,  along with my granddaughters, to purchase this very first book of the series.)  I had planned to reread this one to again catch the magic of Mrs. Rowling's writing. Instead I tossed it in the trash and went back to Alan Hunter.
