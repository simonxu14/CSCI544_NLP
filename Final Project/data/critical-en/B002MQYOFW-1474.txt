I really liked the first book in this series, with the second I lost some hope and by the third I felt I had waisted my time. It was easy to predict how this novel would turn out and I was disappointed that the story line was so focused on the main caricter. Really, everything in the world revolves around just one person? I think this novel was written in a rush and the proof readers must have had a motive for not critiquing it better.
