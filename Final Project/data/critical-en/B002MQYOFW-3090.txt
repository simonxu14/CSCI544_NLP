Like most fans of the first two books of the trilogy, I was really looking forward to the release of Mockingjay, and preordered it to be downloaded to my Kindle. What a disappointment!!! The character development just isn't there in Mockingjay.  Katniss is a whining brat with fleeting loyalties and commitments.  Collins kills people off for shock value.  It's as though Collin's mind was under the influence of the "jacks," not Peetas'.  I didn't like it at all.
