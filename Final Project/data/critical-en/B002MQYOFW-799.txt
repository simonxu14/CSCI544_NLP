I loved the first book, liked the second book, and liked about 1/2 of this book. Many things were too unbelievable and ridiculous. I didn't care for the "twist" at the end or the explaination of what happened to Gale. I also felt that many important scenes that should've been written in detail were glossed over and others that seemed less significant were too long and drawn out. If you have read the first two books, you must read this one to see the story to its end, but be prepared for disappointment.
