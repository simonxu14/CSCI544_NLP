Giving this a middle rating. I would have rated books 1 and 2 a solid 5, but the 3rd ruined it for me. That, however, is because I hated how the story ended. It felt like loose ends were too harshly tied up for shock value, or maybe because Ms. Collins simply did not know how to get certain characters out of the way. I have read somewhere that this series was meant to shed light on the horrors of war and PTSD. If that is true, congrats, I got it. I just didn't enjoy it.<br /><br />I also had some format issues with the eBook. I set the font a certain size for book 1, and when I got to book 2 it changed on its own. Then again for book 3.
