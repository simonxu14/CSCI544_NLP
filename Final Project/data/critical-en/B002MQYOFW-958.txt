Still I think that is way better than the movie. Many aspects of the book that gives a little more excitment to the book aren't put in the movie. But it is still a book with a Light version of a Dystopia. What I found interesting is the extrapollation of the realitues nowadays, but it is poorly excecuted at the end.<br /><br />Good point, you read it fast, and if you want a book in order to distract yourself and to not think very much, it is a great choice.<br /><br />(I'm not a native english speakers, so sorry for the ortogragh)
