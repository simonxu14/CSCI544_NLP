Some Spoilers ahead<br /><br />Let me start by saying I loved the first two books. I also liked the first half of this book as well but then things started going down hill. First it seems like the book just ends about 100 pages short of where it should of. The author leads up to what should be some sort of major final battle, but it never happens. What does happen, which I assume was to shock you, turns out to feel very fake. It also happens so suddenly that I had to reread the section in the book 2 more times to make sure it actually happened.<br /><br />Additionally, the book could have have saved itself had it finished after the final scene with Kat and her bow, had she actually taken the pill, but no that would be to sad I guess.
