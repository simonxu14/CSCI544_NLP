As much as I LOVED the first 2 books, this one fell short for me. The only reason I kept turning the pages was in the hopes it would get better. It doesn't. Every likable quality of every character is stripped away. The book is nothing but depressing battles and deaths and mental breakdowns. I'm not saying that every book has a should have a happily ever after but this book flat out leaves you depressed and sorry you read it at all. Why waste time building up hope in the readers and making them love the characters only to end the story with "life sucks, and then it sucks more." There was no victory over the Capital. The price was too high. And for whatever hope is to be left put in a few measly sentences at the end of the book was almost not even worth it. I go back and restate that I loved love loved the first 2 books... but this one is a REAL downer - no happy endings to be found here. There was an opportunity to do more with this.. there was opportunity to make Katniss the 'girl on fire' that she started out as being. Instead she was turned into a tv fictional superhero and became self-absorbed in self-pity. A far cry from the girl that volunteered to save her sisters life in the beginning. Booo. Hisss...
