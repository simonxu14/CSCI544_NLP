This third and final book of the Hunger Games series disappoints, with a precipitious decline in character for Katniss while ramping up the gore and violence.  Key characters are killed after struggling through the first two books to survive. Not only killed, but in most gruesome manners with considerable gory detail. Katniss who started as such a good role model for young women has evolved into such a love sick loner. She is the Mockingjay yet she spends the entire book doubting herself and showing great weakness, no leadership and no strength. The final scenes are just so awful. The readers empathy is squandered.
