My 13 year old told me to say &quot;Enough with Harry Potter&quot;. I think the author is losing the gemeration of kids who started with her as they get older. He has discovered other series tat he much prefers, such as the Brian Jacques REDWALL series and the DRAGONS OF PERN series. As your kids mature, they will outgrow Harry. Too bad Harry isn't keeping up. Personally, I found this book disappointing. The author is copying from others and pawning it off as her own. No really original ideas, just hype. And this one is just a tad bit cynical and dark. Oh well, you can't hype stuff and expect it to last. I gave this 2 stars for the attempt and some fast moving passages, otherwise there is a lot better out there for your kids.
