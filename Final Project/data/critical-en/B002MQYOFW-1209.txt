With "Mockinjay" one realizes that the point of trilogies is to ruin the last book. I can not see how Collins could have made this much worse. Kill Katniss? She might as well have since she is asleep, crying, in a coma, or something else for the entirety of the book. And she ends up dead inside anyway. KIll Peeta? She actually did. Not physically or anything like it. But she destroyed the character from the first two books and for what? He is literally a killing zombie. Kill Gale? Again, she might as well have since he is no longer the same character. The good friend turns out to the one who kills prim.  Kill Prim - the main driving force of the series? Yeah, she does.<br /><br />All in all, this last book is a complete waste of time since nothing happens as it should. Whenever readers can come up with a better ending for a series, then you know the author has done nothing memorable. And if this is in any way memorable, it's because it is such a terrible conclusion to the first two installments.<br /><br />The violence, the war, the suffering is what drives the first two books. But there is also love. There is katniss and there is peeta. This last book has no katniss, no peeta and no gale. There is no conversation long enough to captivate the heart. There is no hope long enough to inspire a future. There is no fixing of a broken mother and daughter strained relationship. And if all good human qualities are nonexistent, what is the point of this book? All the emotion and all the love and all the hope of a future are left for the last two pages in a summary so short as if it's bone thrown for a starved dog. But it doesn't satiate the hunger. It doesn't heal the violence. Katniss has an "insane-psychotic" peeta, two kids and a broken, empty heart that nothing can heal.<br /><br />Great book!!!
