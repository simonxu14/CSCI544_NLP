I love the Hunger Games series, and it ranks in the top three of my favorite books of all time. Because of this, I wanted to buy the books and keep them forever so I could re-read them whenever I wanted to. However, I ordered this product more than three weeks ago, and it still hasn't even shipped! I am very disappointed with the seller, and I suggest you buy these books from somewhere else.
