I bought this book specifically because it was illustrated.  I pre-ordered back in May, because I was so darned excited about it.  I spent hours on Pottermore, reading Jim Kay's interviews, looking at his videos, studying the pictures from the book he posted on the website.  I was especially enamored of the picture of Hermione on page 150, and I eagerly read Jim's backstory about how the &#34;intricate etchings&#34; on the door and wall behind her came about.  I about wet myself when the postman delivered my book earlier this month.<br /><br />And then....and then.....I opened to Hermione's picture.  Well, I don't exactly know how to describe it except to say that compared to the reproduction on the webpage, this image seemed muted, somehow darker - it just didn't &#34;pop.&#34;  And definitely, definitely, those &#34;intricate etchings&#34; that Jim went on about in his interview on Pottermore, were not nearly as crisp in the book.  In comparing some of the other illustrations, I noticed the same thing:  Unless you're looking at the pictures under a *very* strong light, many of the images just aren't as sharp as I've seen online.  Perhaps that was a sacrifice that had to be made in printing, but it still made me a little sad.<br /><br />Okay, that said, I realize it could just be me, because I'm a nut for this kind of detail, right?  Because honestly the pictures are BEAUTIFUL overall.  But for real?  I bought the book because it was an *illustrated* version, and the illustrations have disappointed me, and I'm having trouble getting past the feeling.  Heavy sigh...
