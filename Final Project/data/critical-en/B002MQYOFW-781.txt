Speculative fiction allows a lot of latitude, and Ms. Collins takes full advantage of that. The scenario is very improbable but vital to story-fine. The terrible, warped mentality and taste of the ruling class seems based on the classic Romans-important.  The characters are realistically human, with complexity and generally a good side.<br />However, the pace is uneven, with the reader alternately glued to the story or wanting to &#34;get on with it&#34;. &#34;Hunger Games&#34; is science fiction-no magic or the like, and she often goes beyond the limits, most notably with the technical powers of the elite, like being always being able to intimately watch the players, even underground. Instant helicopters violate time and distance limits. The gratuitous &#34;armor suit&#34; that is flexible, but deflects an arrow without the wearer even feeling it's huge force/area as it struck. The hokey &#34;wolves&#34; that looked like dead combatants.<br />Read &#34;Hunger Games&#34; for light entertainment-not thoughtful.
