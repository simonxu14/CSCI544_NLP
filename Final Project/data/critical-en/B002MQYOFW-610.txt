The book dragged. The action was boring and only resulted in death after death, where the author tried to outdo herself as she killed off the characters- "how much more atrocious/disgusting can I make the next death be?"<br /><br />Katniss was a drug induced mess. Peeta was a crazed maniac. And the redeeming characters that had found some sort of happiness and purpose in life, die. It was all very inspiring (sense the sarcasm). And the happy ending we thirst for since The Hunger Games, well it was stale and not exactly happy after all. Big let down.
