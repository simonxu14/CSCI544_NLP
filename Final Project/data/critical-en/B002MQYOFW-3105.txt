I was completely enthralled with the first two books.  Unfortunately I felt disappointed with the third.  I felt like the only reason it was written was to finish up the trilogy and it didn't really enhance the first two.  After reading the first two, you know it's inevitable that there is a third, so the only reason I'd recommend this book is to finish off the series.
