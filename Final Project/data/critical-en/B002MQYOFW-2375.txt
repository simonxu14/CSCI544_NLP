After receiving much hype about the Hunger Games, I decided I'd finally download a copy to my kindle and read it, as I had gotten a gift card. The series is all over lately, so I had figured it would be a fun read. I thought wrong.<br /><br />The concept itself is beautiful, however the quality of writing was awful. I had trouble getting into the character's head simply because I felt like a child could have written it.  I powered through them, as I make it a point to try and finish things I pay for, but it was difficult and I ended up reading another novel along with it just to keep me wanting to read. Ultimately, I was very disappointed. If you're someone who is able to look past terrible writing quality and just enjoy the plot and characters, I'm sure it's a fantastic read and is worth the acclaim it gets, but I am not one of those people, and struggled through every chapter.
