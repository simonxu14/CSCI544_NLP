I had trouble getting through the book. The only reason I finished it is so I could discuss it with my grown daughter. I do not understand anyone writing a book where kids kill kids. If I could have given this book less than one star I would have. It really disturbs me that schools are making this required reading when there are so many other books with redeeming qualities.
