I read this largely based on the number of five star reviews.  I also read it because other reviews said that while it did fall into the "youth" or "young adult" genre, older adults would enjoy it too.  The concept of the story was entertaining enough, but as others have pointed out, pretty brutal, teenagers forced into a competition where they're forced to kill or be killed.  I did not, however, find the actual death passages to be overly grotesque.  Still, in my opinion this is definitely a book that will appeal much more to younger readers than more adult, mature readers.  While it was a well told story, I personally found the writing to be a bit simplistic, and doubt that I'll be reading the rest of the trilogy.
