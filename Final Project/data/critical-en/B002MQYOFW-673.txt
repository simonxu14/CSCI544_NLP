I started out hating this series, but it grew on me. Now that I've finished it I miss it. By main gripe with the book is that Katniss, having lived a hard live, acts more like a Valley Girl than a survivor. Living that close to the earth, in a harsh world with the threat of death on a daily basis, well, that makes you grow up fast. She hasn't. Hasn't a clue, actually.<br /><br />But while others disliked the ending, I found it worked well. My gripe was with the climax. I won't spoil it. It's a great twist, yet left me unsatisfied. How this plot twist could be executed with no future ramifications for Katniss eludes me.<br /><br />So four stars for a so-so book.<br /><br />Three stars because of the Kindle editors are delivering their usual, botched content. How long as the Kindle been around? And these people STILL can't get it right!
