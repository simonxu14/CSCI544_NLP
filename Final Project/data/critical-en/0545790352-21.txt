Book is nice and sturdy. Pictures are beautifully done. But I am on page 4 and there are multiple words that are spelled wrong.....I prefer the Americanized version I guess so it makes it annoying to read when neighbours, dialling, realised are all staring at me on the page and again I am on page 4.
