Just bought my Kindle and this was the first title I downloaded.  I had not heard of the author or the book before.  I was delighted with it.  The style is simple, uncomplicated and would be an ideal book for a vacation. It is not too deep and is probably aimed at teenagers but having left my teens behind a long time ago, I sill enjoyed it.<br /><br />I have ordered the second title in the series and look forward to it.
