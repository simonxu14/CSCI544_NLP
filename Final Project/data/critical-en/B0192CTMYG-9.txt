I like to read Spanish translations of books I've read in English.  This approach makes it easier for me to learn more Spanish without the need to keep thumbing through the dictionary.  That's why I was eager to read the &#34;Harry Potter&#34; series in Spanish!<br /><br />This first effort is the weakest translation in the series.  I purchased several other translations in the series.  They were much better.  (It's not fair to be too critical of the translation.  Translating puns based on Anglo-saxon words - vs. concepts - is probably an impossible task.)
