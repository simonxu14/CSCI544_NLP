I mostly listened to this book just to finish out the trilogy.  If that is what you are doing, then go ahead and do it.  If you are reading this book (as opposed to an audio book), then I feel sorry for you.  I would have never finished this book if I was reading it.  The story line is VERY choppy and feels piece-milled just to stretch the story.  In the end, there are still some confusing things about it.  Now, to be honest, I did not find the "Hunger Games" a great story or particularly well written.  It was good, but certainly not great.  The second book kept my interest, but I was just glad to finish this one.  So, read this if you are just interested in how it ends, but do not expect a great story or writing.
