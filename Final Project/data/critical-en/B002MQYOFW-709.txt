Of course. Here we go AGAIN. At first i thought this book would be just extraordinary. It was just OK. Of course we have a girl main charector. In this case she is a cold, selfish, and depressed.It is the same plot we have seen before. We all knew Prim would be picked at the reaping. We knew Gale would be jelous of Katniss and Peeta. We knew Katniss and Peeta would win and hook up. This plot was sooo predictable. We have seen it before. Blah, blah, blah! The good parts were the ones were no one knew were coming. Like, Rue dying in front of Katniss. Wait never mind. We all knew THAT one was coming. One really shocking thing that I found out was Katniss being sooo mean. I mean come on! We all know you live were food is scarse and only one person understands you. But come on! You have a family. Before i make this any longer, i have to say the movie was very good. Just the book wasn't all it cracked up to be. Over and out :).
