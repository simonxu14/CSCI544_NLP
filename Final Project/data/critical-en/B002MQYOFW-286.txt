This is a review of the kindle trilogy formatting... I can't understand why the font sizes are different from every other kindle book I have. Disappointing. The smallest possible font size is a size or two larger than the usual... Basically makes this a large print book without telling you before you buy it. If you need large print, this is for you. (Although every kindle book has larger font sizes if you want them.) Otherwise, if you usually read in small type face, I'd buy a different version. :(
