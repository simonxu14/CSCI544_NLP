I absolutely LOVED the first two books of this trilogy, but I felt like Ms. Collins rushed through this just to get the third book out and done with.  It seems like Collins just had Katniss pass out as action was about to happen so that she wouldn't have to come up with what was going on.  I had very very high expectations for this book especially after the first two were as brilliant as they were, but this book was a huge disappointment.<br /><br />That being said, I don't regret reading it, and I still recommend reading it but don't think that it's going to be anything like The Hunger Games or Catching Fire.
