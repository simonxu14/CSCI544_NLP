Let me say first that the formatting was terrible: I had to constantly change the font size and line spacing because it kept changing from one chapter to another. It was truly, very annoying. Shame on Amazon or whoever is responsible for this.<br /><br />Now, on to the books per se.<br /><br />THG trilogy takes place in a dystopian future (if that's not your genre, then don't even try because this is as dystopian as it gets). It is well written and descriptions are so vivid you can easily picture the places, the people and the overall glum, despair and hopelessness of it all.<br /><br />Katniss, although a little annoying due to her lack of feelings, ability to show them, or both, sounds like the obvious result of the place and times in which she's living and the things she's had to endure. Still, as a main character I don't really like her. Peeta, on the other hand is probably the real hero of the story. He is a bascally good, generous human being, an optimist and easier to relate to. He reminds me of Samwise Gamgee (The Lord of the Rings) in that even when things are at their darkest he can always find the silver lining beyond. All characters, in general, are well defined and believable.<br /><br />All in all the books make for a good, easy read and are quite entertaining. However, IMHO, they start at the highest point with THG, which was great. Catching Fire was ok but is already faltering here and there. By the time you get to Mockingjay you get the feeling the writer is under a lot of pressure to finish the book and more focused on trying not to leave any loose ends, giving it this incomplete feeling to it. But, since you've already invested some time reading the first two books and become attached to the characters, you can't just stop without knowing what happens in the end, and that's Mockingjay's one virtue: it brings closure to the whole adventure. And I'm not complaining about the ending per se, because in all honesty, I don't hink it could've ended any ther way. My disappointment is about the way in which things were handled and written.<br /><br />I'd tell people to buy only THG, but it's impossible to leave it at that, so just be aware that if you buy the trilogy, you're getting one good book and a half and a mediocre book and a half.
