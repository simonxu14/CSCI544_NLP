Having seen the recent release of the Hunger Games Movie series, I decided I didn't feel like waiting for another 2 years so that I can complete the series - so I got my read on!<br /><br />These books are very easy to read, and obviously very entertaining. However the level of sophistication in the novels is certainly at the level of early-mid teen readers. This is something I should have expected before starting!<br /><br />Collins does paint the picture of a very interesting post-apocalyptic world, where there is only one republic left with the last human survivors of a 'great war' that threatened the species.<br /><br />All in all, if you're looking for a quick, easy, entertaining read - definitely dive into the world of Panem and Katniss Everdeen.<br /><br />3/5
