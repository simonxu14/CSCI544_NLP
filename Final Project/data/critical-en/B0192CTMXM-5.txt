I've been a major fan of the Harry Potter books since I got my hands on the Sorcerer's stone, some six years ago.  I fell in love with the characters of Harry, Ron and Hermione and absolutely adored their friendship.  Ever since then I've been fanatical about the series, and feel that Rowling has wonderful wit and a phenominal way of creating a world.<br /><br />However, I was sorely disappointed in the conclusion of the series, unfortunately.  As many others have said, the series ending does rely on a lot of deux ex machina, cliche and entirely too convenient plot devices to get Harry and his friends out of a jam, and also does rely on major characters giving long soliloquies about the whats and whys of the plot so that the characters finally understand certain elements, and consequently, so do the readers.  A good author knows to subtly include these answers in previous books, under the guise of something completely different so that we and the characters might re-discover them later.<br /><br />Another thing that was most disappointing to me was the introduction in the very last book of certain items that we had never before heard of, one of which helped Harry defeat his enemy.  These were entirely too convenient and felt like a huge cop-out on the part of the author.<br /><br />The most annoying and unfortunately, disappointing element of the last book, however, has to be the relationships that were ultimately formed and stuck, until "nineteen years later".<br /><br />I am one of those readers who gets more involved and invested in the characters/relationships of a series, even above the storyline.  I found the resultant romantic relationships to be unrealistic and frankly, bewildering, considering what we know of the characters "personalities", and considering that a good author should understand what must happen between two characters in order that a later romantic relationship between the two of them seems viable.<br /><br />I find that in books, the most satisfying and realistic romance comes from having written a well-developed, deep and abiding friendship between two characters first; having them together through the hero or heroine's trials from the beginning. Unfortunately, in trying to keep Harry from falling for Ginny too soon, Rowling kept Ginny almost completely out of Harry's life, and out of the story, until the ending.  This results in a sudden love relationship that is neither satisfying, well-written, or realistic, and makes it so that the hero's love interest is not well-known or desired by readers for the hero.<br /><br />Considering Ron and Hermione's relationship, although Rowling did grow them relationally through the series, there was not near enough of the positive in their friendship, and not near enough respect and genuine "like" of the other person to warrant such an ending for them.  In other words, although I caught the author's many hints at letting the reader know the two felt romantically for one another, the author did not do enough to show why they fell for one another.<br /><br />Neither love match in the end was satisfying, realistic, or well-written to me as a reader, and unfortunately for me, as I am so invested in characters and relationships even more so than storylines, it left me cold towards an ending I so dearly wanted to embrace as a satisfying one.<br /><br />The author would have been better served to have placed Ginny in the "Hermione" role of the story, so that Harry and his intended grew together throughout, in friendship and respect.  As for Ron and Hermione, the resultant relationship would have been much more believable had the author included more positives in a relationship between the two that almost the entire time focused on the negative.<br /><br />I may be different from others in what I view constitutes a well-written story, and the friendships between the characters, I believe, were well-written were they to stay as mere friendships... but the fact that they turned into romances when they were not written well enough to have been, ruined much of it for me.<br /><br />Children's series or not, I feel that if an element is to be included in the story, it should be done believably.
