While I am fully aware that this book is truly intended for a much younger audience; as an older reader (early twenties), I am disappointed in this latest edition of the Harry Potter series. Too little plot was stretched out into an enormously long book and lacked the exciting twist and turns in plot of the previous four books. My advice to anyone buying the book (hopefully used since new is still too expensive), don't expect too much from this book because of the hype.<br />Certain characters were back and good as ever, other new characters were interesting to follow. Harry experiences the pains of teenhood in a rather angsty, uninteresting and foul manner. There is a lot of filler story in this book and could have easliy been consensed into half its size.<br />However, this is an important book in the series because many essential plot developments for the continuation of the series are presented. In short, buy it if you have already read the series and like it enough to sick it out through the rest of the two remaining books. Take it for what it's worth, a young adult novel and not some childrens masterpiece from which it falls short of.
