I sped through the book, primarily because it's an easy read. I liked the premise, and I wanted to like Katniss. Along the way, she kept letting me down. The juxtaposition between very capable self-sufficient hunter and the girl who can't say yes, or no, didn't match up. Perhaps the author was trying to convey a complicated personality. It comes off as two personalities jammed into the same girl.<br />As an adventure novel, it's fine.<br />I read a lot. Many of today's adventure and mystery fiction consists of pages of characters asking questions, what if this? suppose that? maybe the other? I call it filler. The author needs to add more words, so he/she does it with filler. It doesn't move the story along, it does add more pages.<br />In the movies, they do it with endless chase scenes. You don't have to write interesting, funny or entertaining dialogue if you can spend ten minutes at a stretch banging up cars.<br />I understand from reviews of the next two books, that Katniss continues her `maybe this, maybe not, maybe, maybe, maybe' hand-wringing dithering. How she can be so indecisive and survive in that world doesn't compute. My trilogy stops at one.
