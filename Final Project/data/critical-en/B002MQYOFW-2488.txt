1.) Anyone read Stephen King writing as Richard Bachman? If so you would see that this book's plot shares the basic framework of a book he wrote titled, "The Long Walk." The government hosts a long walk where a hundred teen boys compete in a race of sorts unti they succumb to fatigue, hunger, madness, etc... and get a bullet in the brain. In the end the last one standing wins. The winner and his family reap benefits very similar to the victors in the Hunger Games. There is also the Japanese "Battle Royal" to consider which is even closer in terms of storyline.<br /><br />2.) In addition, any redeeming quality of a love story this book may have isn't realized until the last line of the final book, which means you have to read them all in order to justify reading any of them!<br /><br />3.) The anarchist streak in me wants to give this book a high rating for bringing forward the possibilities and dangers of voting in a government big enough and powerful enough to "take care" of us all; but ultimately only takes care of its self. However, I cannot give Collins that much credit since the storyline is not her own. At least other versions had underlying subtleties that wove together a deeper, more meaningful plot. This book offers up no such morsel of virtue.<br /><br />4.) Should young readers be reading this? No. This book is rated R and no mother in her right mind would subject her children to this warped line of thinking in their impressionable years. However, if ANY of this trilogy's books is to be read by a late teen it should be limited to this first one. (spoiler) In later books she corrals babies, toddlers, and pre-school age children together and send little bombs to them in packaging that would suggest a gift. The bombs explode, but not to the point that it kills them all, just enough to draw more, underage assistance to the squirming, crying, suffering and bloody babies only to have a second wave of bombs explode.<br /><br />I say, is THIS what qualifies as entertainment to us now? Need we go from satire to slap-stick violence for entertainment? Not for anyone with half a brain or more.
