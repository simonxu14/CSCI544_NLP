Katniss: As soon as she said the words "I volunteer as tribute" we've loved her strength, passion and fire. But in Mockingjay she speends most of her time hiding in closets and getting drugged.<br /><br />Peeta: Our sweet, kind, loving and downright better person this turns into a mutt. A MUTT!!! Why Collins? I cried and cried when he choked Katniss. Thankfully he somewhat turns to normal. But the boy with the bread is not the same.<br /><br />Prim: Honestly she's the one who started it all. Killed in one horrible sentence. We didn't even have time to mourn. And who killed her? Who was the cause for this injustice? We don't know it might have been Gale but it could have been the capitol.<br /><br /> Gale: He leaves without even saying goodbye.<br /><br />There were so many unnecessary deaths so so many. Poor Finick :(<br /><br />Epilogue: Their love slowly grows back together? What in the world?
