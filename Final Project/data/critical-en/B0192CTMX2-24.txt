How can a boy change so much over the summer.  This book begins the summer after the fourth book leaves off.  Within that time Harry Potter goes from being a well mannered and yet mischievous young man to being a spoiled, self centered, and often hard to like, child.  Finally, literature has come out with a male character who experiences PMS just like girls do.  There are some good parts like bringing back Lupin for one, and seeing some of Snapes childhood, it is interesting.  I hope the next one is better because had this been the first book in the series I don't think the publisher would have bought it.  The book is a must read if you follow the series and want to understand some key points but the book is disappointing.  Nobody is perfect including the author of this book.
