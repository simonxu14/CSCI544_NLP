I enjoyed the story line of this series up until the last part of this book.  I was left a bit disappointed and cold after finishing this book.  It really felt like the end was just rushed to wrap it up.  The twist in the execution was left to assume why but not really explained.  Katniss and her state of mind were left weak, and while it may be intentional, it seemed half hearted.  The final chapter and epilogue just left it as a last resort and not a desired result.  So, I am left a little disappointed with this trilogy that I was so riveted to at the beginning.
