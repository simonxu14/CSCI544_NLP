As in the other books there were some interesting moments here.  But the author seemed to cover less original ground.  There were some seemingly-forced analogues to life in the arena; Katniss continues to vacillate between her loves, making an abrupt and perhaps too-little-explained decision at the end; her relationship with her sister and mother is badly underdeveloped, considering how much she's supposed to love them both.  Katniss also makes an inexplicable, cruel decision at the end of the book that leaves the reader nonplussed.  Overall, not too compelling a read.
