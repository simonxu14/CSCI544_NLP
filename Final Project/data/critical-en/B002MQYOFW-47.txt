If you want to read a book that almost exclusively details a teenage girls repetitive, shallow and boring inner monologue while everything important is happening elsewhere and briefly yet inadequately gets explained later, then this book is for you.<br /><br />This book is completely detached from the rest of the trilogy.  We learn that nothing that has happened thus far, except for Katniss' inexplicable celebrity with everyone in Panem, is important or even relevant.  Everything we know about Peeta, Gale and most other main characters is irrelevant as the characters as you know them do not make a single appearance.<br /><br />Collins seems determined to kill off important or beloved characters in an attempt to shock you, only to never be mentioned again (unless of course it's time for one of Katniss' break-downs).<br /><br />Collins also seems to be obsessed with humanities ultimate failing as a species with no redeeming qualities, to the point where it bursts through into the story, much to its detriment.<br /><br />The writing, especially in the second half of the book, is downright lazy.  Things start happening with no explanation, character motivations are never explored, important events are brushed over or simply used as an excuse for Katniss to be sent to hospital and drugged again and the ultimate choice between Peeta and Gale does not appear to be made entirely within reality.<br /><br />There is not a single authentic character interaction in this entire novel.  My best explanation would be that Collins was making it up as she went along and it is my earnest recommendation that you do not read the book and imagine your own ending to the Hunger Games trilogy.
