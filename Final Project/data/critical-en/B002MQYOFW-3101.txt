This story is so contrived and so beyond belief. It seems as if it's just set up for sensationalism and violence. The plot could have been captivating for those interested in life in the future under a dictatorial government, but it was way over the top. I read all of it, but it was a chore and I couldn't wait for it to be over. I won't be reading this author's next book.
