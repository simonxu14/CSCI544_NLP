I ordered the audiobook of the 7th Harry Potter book and was excited when I received it three or four days after I'd ordered it - I was shocked at how quick the turnaround time was, very pleased.<br />However, the CD's didn't work right with my computer. The whole point of getting them was so that I could put them on my computer, and then from there on my iPod or whatever, so that was upsetting.<br />I emailed AZ Fulfillment with my issue and they expressed their condolences and gave me step by step instructions to return it & receive a full refund.<br />Although the product didn't work out for me, the service from AZ Fulfillment makes me much more inclined to return in the future.<br />Thank you.
