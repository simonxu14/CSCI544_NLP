While I had read a number of reviews prior to purchasing the book, I didn't read the book description.  If I had, I would have known it was written for children!  I enjoyed Book 1, but by Book 2 I began to suspect this series was written for a younger audience. The lack of maturity in the character and plot development was disappointing and the book became somewhat boring.  The premise of the book is compelling and in the hands of someone like Stephen King or Dean Koontz, it would have been an excellent read for adults, as well.
