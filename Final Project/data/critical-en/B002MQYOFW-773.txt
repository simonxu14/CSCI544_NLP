I absolutely loved the first two books.  I loved the characters that were developed.  I felt liked I knew everyone in the story in a personal way and I love it when a author can do that. Above all though, I was in love with the relationship between Katniss and Peeta and even the added love triangle with Gale. If this is your favorite part as well I'm sorry to say but you will most likely be disappointed in this conclusion of the series as I was.  I realize that Ms. Collins was mostly like trying to reflect reality of what these characters lives would be after everything they have gone through and witnessed but I don't think the end did justice to the characters and love story she created.<br /><br />Spoiler alert:<br /><br />The most notable disappointing thing to me: When they rescue Peeta and he has obviously hijacked I hate how Katniss doesn't try harder to help him.  She even comes to the realization of that and how if it were the other way around Peeta would do everything he could to remind her of their love and to reach her but she makes no real effort except for one little kiss to keep him sane.  I kept thinking the pearl, the pearl, give him the pearl Katniss!! It will help him remember!! She holds on to it the whole time as a token of that love but never tries to help him remember what that pearl reminders her of!?! Come on!  If felt like to me that the love story that made me love these books and characters was almost completely undone in this book.
