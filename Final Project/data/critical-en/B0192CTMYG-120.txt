This is NOT a first edition, first printing as stated in the headline description.  I purchased this as a gift for a collector, it is not collector quality.  Also the headline description does not mention it is a large print edition, you have to go to the product description below to find that out... I felt the headline description was very misleading and am now extremely disappointed with the product.  This review in no way reflects on the story or author, I love the Harry Potter series, I am just upset that this book is not what was advertised.
