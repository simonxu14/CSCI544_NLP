Finished the series recently; thought 'the Hunger Games' was very good (a bit simplistic, perhaps, but I understand these are generally classified as teen literature). The second, 'Catching Fire,' had the vague feeling to it that the publisher suggested a continuation after the first did so well. The third was just plain long winded, with an ending so storybook perfect that I almost gagged.<br /><br />Really not much need to read 'Catching Fire' and 'Mockingjay,' after 'the Hunger Games' unless you're really into these stories.<br /><br />Otherwise, it doesn't take much imagination to guess where things are headed.
