The first book in this series was very well written and quite enjoyable.  The 2nd was a little less so.  This final installment had some good points and an excellent plot, but in spots, the writing was poor...amateur, even.  At some points, Collins was too wordy and I found myself glossing over parts here and there.  There were also a few times where I found myself reading a passage and thinking that the wording choice did not fit with the rest of the dialect from the story.  Certain phrases here and there...something Katniss would say that didn't seem to fit in with my understanding of her character.<br /><br />It felt a bit too drawn out in parts, as well.  Unlike the Harry Potter series, where I wanted more...at the conclusion of this final novel, I was glad to be done with the series.<br /><br />Overall, The Hunger Games series was done fairly decent.  But this final novel...I think Collins could have been better.
