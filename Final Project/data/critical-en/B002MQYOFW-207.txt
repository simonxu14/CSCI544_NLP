What a horribly despairing, depressing person Suzanne Collins must be! The Hunger Games was gripping and entertaining. Catching Fire was surprising as well as gripping but it left you hanging so you had to read the next book. Mockingjay was despairing! It holds you only because after coming so far you had to know how it ends. And the end is so despairing. This author should not be writing children's books.<br /><br />Final thought: it's like the author got to the end of everything she had to write and she thought (or the publisher did), "Ok, I've got to close this out somehow. I'll just stick these last 2 pages in and hope it goes over well!"<br /><br />My recommendation: After you read The Hunger Games, STOP! Appreciate is as a good story and leave it at that. If you start reading Catching Fire you'll just have to read Mockingjay to finish the story. And believe me, you don't want to go there!
