It was ok. I am happy with how fast it arrived. The book was a little bit scuffed and yellowed, but I expected this from a book claiming to be a first edition. I do say claiming to be a first edition because this certainly is not. Mine appears to be a 7th printing and I am quite disappointed about that fact. A more reasonable price for this book would have been $7-10. Maybe look around a few more places before settling on buying from here.
