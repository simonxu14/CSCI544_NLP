This review is from the thoughts of a pre-teen.  I read the book as a school assignment because I thought I might like it because of the action.  It was really hard to follow in the beginning when they talked about why they have hunger games.  When the action began it got better, but I guess it is not the same as seeing in a movie or on TV.  The theme of the book was a little dark, because I am a boy I like force, but this was scary.<br /><br />Children fighting until the last one standing really were what stood out in this book.  I think the author trying to make it look like the two main characters were good guys was not good, they did kill.  The coaches who were there to help them figure out how to win were okay.  Then for some reason there is this attempt at adding romance to the book, it did not seem to fit.  I guess I did not like the book, I do not like fantasy, and it is too farfetched, just like this book.
