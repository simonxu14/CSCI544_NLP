Ok, for all of you who think that she is so creative and such, look up a novel/manga by the name of Battle Royale. It has 15 books in its series, and was finished back in 2006. All this author did was take Battle Royale's idea, and change some details to make it her own. There is even a Battle Royale movie, made back in 2000! There are too many similarities for it to just be a coincidence.<br /><br />WARNING! SPOILERS!<br /><br />1. Ok, for BR there was a corrupt Japanese government, while HG had it in North America.<br /><br />2. BR kidnapped a class of middle school kids(ages about 12-16), while HG took 2 kids 12-18 from each sector.<br /><br />3. Both had stronger kids forming alliances, also in HG the guy was in love with the girl, and the girl started falling for him. In BR, the girl loved the guy, and the guy started falling for her.<br /><br />4. Both have an "arena" of sorts that they are stuck on while fighting, and both have the "game masters" who interfere to make things more interesting. Oh, and both have announcements to say who died.<br /><br />5. While in BR they start out with a bag that had a random weapon in it, in HG they are randomly just scattered at the starting point.<br /><br />There are many other similarities, but i wont point them all out. Also, the first book in HG is whole 15 of BR. BR ended at the end of the games, as did the first book of HG. Now, do you wonder why books 2 and 3 of HG didn't get near the reviews praise that the first book did? Because she had nothing more to copy from! BR was over by this point, so the rest of it is all the authors own ideas. My point is, she doesn't deserve all the credit and praise and money that she is getting. And the only reason she is getting away with it is because the fan base for Adult Japanese manga is small here in the U.S. and in most non asian countries in the world, and it was done 6 years ago, so those who DID read it might not remember it well enough to see the theft.<br /><br />I hope you will give Battle Royale a chance(even if you aren't a fan of graphic novels, it is a GREAT story) and see that I am correct. It is 18+ because its aimed at adult audiences, lots of gore and some sexual scenes. Thanks for reading, hope you all take it to heart!
