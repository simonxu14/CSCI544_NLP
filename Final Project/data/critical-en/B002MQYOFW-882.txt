I'm sad when good books have bad endings. And for Mockingjay, by bad ending I don't mean that I don't like the turn of events (I don't, but that's subjective), but that the events just don't make sense and everything seems pointless.<br /><br />The whole mission to assasinate Snow is pointless, since the rebels in the end make it faster to Snow than Katniss can. Prim's death is unnecessary and gratuitos. This makes the premise of all three books (Katniss going through all of the hardships to save Prim) pointless and it is unsatisfying when in the end the author kills Prim just with a swipe of her pen, in circumstances that are random at best.<br /><br />I hope if they ever make a movie, they will rethink the final chapters to something less artificial and more satisfying.
