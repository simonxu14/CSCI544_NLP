These are great books. I have been apprehensive about reading them for some time because I tend ti avoid the trends, but sometimes the trends are right. Sample them and if you are intrigued get them. I purchased the kindle trilogy edition and thoroughly enjoyed them. Despite the formatting complaints if others, I found that it in no way impeded my reading experience. Though there are formatting issues, I never noticed during the course of reading them. My only warning is to be sure you have time available to commit to readig these as you will not want to put them down. Enjoy!<br /><br />Amending:  I reviewed these books before I was completely finished with the trilogy.  The first two books are very good and pull you through quickly. I found the third book, disappointing to say the list.  Like some other readers, Katniss became too self concerned and bratty.  I guess all I can say is that the author provided a very shallow and disappointing ending to a very good set of books.
