This last book in the Hunger Games series I found quite disturbing, but in the end lets face it history has shown us how brutal we humans can be when it come wanting to win a war. We justify such horrors in the name of the final goal of peace.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this book an average star rating is the very rushed ending. It read to me like more of an outline to an ending. I was very disappointed there were very few dialogue scenes in the end among the main characters and more just wrap up descriptive text. I would still recommend reading this book just don't expect to much at a the end.
