Before I get started, I'll go ahead and tell you that the story is enjoyable and exciting.  At a certain point, the story picks up its pace, and gets moving in a really interesting and creative way.  Why did I give it three stars?  Let me explain.<br /><br />The Good: The story is creative, at times very exciting, has a few good characters, and eventually has good suspense.  It's no news that Suzanne Collins can cook up a great, thrilling story.  However...<br /><br />The Bad: A few things concerned me.  One, the main character (Katniss) was hard to like.  I didn't find her insight to be very exciting or compelling, and it took a very long time for me to care about the outcome of her character.  I felt like I was reading for the sake of seeing what Suzanne Collins would come up with, instead of reading for the chain of events.  There were no characters that felt particularly weighty to me, like I would meet them in real life. I have a feeling that this book was made for young adults, and more attention was paid to the action and less on the realism of character traits, which is okay.<br /><br />On the same note of unbelievability, I feel like there's an essence of creative sabotage in place.  Without spoiling too much, there's a character who's name went into a jar once out of a huge amount of names, and just happened to be chosen.  It would've been more believable if the characters were more shocked, but there was more of a "what can you do?" attitude about it, which didn't really put me in their shoes.<br /><br />Last but not least, the actual writing.  There are fragmented sentences everywhere, and if you've had an advanced high school or college writing class, it can make you cringe.  This is what it's like:<br /><br />I went to the store.  And then I got some bread. But not before I got cheese. Good cheese.  But at first I didn't have the money.  And that was sad.<br /><br />It's readable, but feels very amateur, and took away the solid foundation needed for me to get completely invested in the book.  There were also two occasions where a sentence flat out just didn't make sense.  An educated editor would've done this book a lot of good.<br /><br />That's my personal experience with the book.  I'm not sure anyone else feels this way (my friends certainly don't), but if you're a little meticulous about the details of literature, let this be a warning.  Otherwise, it's a good read, and you'll get a good story out of it.
