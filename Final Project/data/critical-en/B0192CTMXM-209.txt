I loved all of the Harry Potter books--this was my least favorite and reminiscent of when Conan Doyle got so sick of writing the Sherlock Holmes stories that he threw Holmes over Reichenbach Falls. (...)  At lease the plot picks up after this. Deathly Hallows is not a stand-alone story; you have to be familiar with the Harry Potter mythos to understand the plot. The epilogue--please---I would much rather use my imagination.  This is supposed to be the last--but then again--Sherlock survived Reichenbach after all didn't he?
