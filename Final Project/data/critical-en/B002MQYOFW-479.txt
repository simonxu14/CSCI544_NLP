I have now seen the movie and read all three books. I would have to say, overall, I liked them as I was drawn into the story, partly by the movie, and wanted to see how it ended. I won't give anything away here, but the ending is what you would expect. Critically speaking, the writing left me feeling something was missing. I guess I wanted more action, more thrill, than the page after page of a 17 year-old's constant introspection, constant questioning who loves me and who do I love. Maybe that's the point of the story. The events surrounding Katniss's &#34;finding&#34; herself is of secondary importance. I don't want to go on and on here but suffice it to say the story is intriguing in a post apocalyptic way and one can only hope that the society Katniss is becoming an adult in can truly change for the good. Thank goodness they no longer have to give up their children to the games.
