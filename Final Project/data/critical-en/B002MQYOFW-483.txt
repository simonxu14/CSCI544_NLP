While I enjoyed the first person perspective (FPP) in the first book and found it to still be mostly engaging in the second book, I found it intolerable in Mockingjay.  It's hard to specify anything more without giving out spoilers, but at this point in the novel the FPP that kept the first book suspenseful now becomes a source of frustration due to the direction they take Katniss.<br /><br />Also, not sure why everyone was so shocked about the ending.  Thought it fit well with the characters.
