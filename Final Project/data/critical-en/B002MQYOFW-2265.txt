I really like the first two books.  Even though they all take at least 150 pages to get interesting, the first two at least held my interest well.  This book is just a complete turn for the worst though.  I feel that what fuel or direction the author had, slowly drifted away.  It's slow and boring.  The end is horrible and garbage.  What happened?  I just feel this series lost its stride and someone took the reins and said &#34;let's see how badly we can end this.&#34;  It doesn't even fit really.  I don't know, it's just not what I had hoped for.  I guess two out of three is better then not enjoying the series at all right? By the way, this took me several attempts to finish reading.  Probably over 6 months because my attention was always pulled away.  Read it to finish the series but don't get your hopes up.
