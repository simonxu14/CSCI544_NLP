I enjoyed the 1st book, was entertained by the 2nd, but sorely disappointed in the 3rd. It felt really rushed, and there were several times I was thinking , "Huh? What just happened?" And then when a minor character suddenly appears for no real reason and then dies I kept reading on feeling that surely Katniss was dreaming because none of it made any sense. I wasn't hoping for a fairytale ending, just an ending that didn't leave me angry and confused.
