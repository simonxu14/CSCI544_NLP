Didn't love it, didn't hate it. Perhaps it's more for the readers that loved the Twilight series...I wasn't even interested enough in them to read the first one. I used to watch the TV reality show Survivor religiously, but it got too redundant and predictable. I kind of feel like The Hunger Games is a written version of Survivor. Only it has some ammusing things like the tracker jackers & mockingjays---cute, kind of like Dr Seuss creatures. I'll see the movie---hope the killing isn't too disturbing. I'll be interested in seeing how the movie protrays the main characters and the "Seuss-like" characters. I still haven't decided on whether to read Book 2 & 3 or not....I kind of feel obligated.
