I am a huge fan of Harry Potter and of Jim Dale. He acts out these books expertly and has consistantly amazed and enthralled me with his depth and versatility with each character. So why three stars only? That sounds pretty good right? Well, I don't know if Jim Dale is to blame, or if Warner Brothers is the culprit, but you don't change the pronunciation of a MAJOR character's name after already establishing that pronunciation in no less than FOUR previous books. I find the hard "T" at the end of Voldemort's name in this book annoying and irritating. I have come to know the characters in these books, not only through my own readings, but through Jim Dale's and I find this change to be cheap and cheesy. I have worked as an editor and proof-reader for years, and one thing stands true above almost any other rule: Consistancy is next to Godliness.
