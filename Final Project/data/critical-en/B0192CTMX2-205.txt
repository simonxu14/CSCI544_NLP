Suffer through horrid writing to follow a great story.<br />Rowling creates memorable characters and situations, but I really wish she'd buy a thesaurus and take a writing class. Every character "beams" at each other on every other page, and I don't even want to count the number of times I had to stop reading to figure out who was speaking. A grammar lesson wouldn't hurt her writing either. Maybe she could afford an editor now?<br />I just get the feeling that she rushed these books tp press before she had a chance to polish the writing. (All Harry Potter books have these same problems, but I think the fifth book has the most.)
