I waited two days to write this review because I really couldnt decide where I would go. I knew right away that the pace of this final book was too quick. I felt the entire way through that Collins seemed tired of the troubles that Katniss faced and wanted it to be over. Weeks would pass at a time with Katniss simply going through the motions of depression and lonliness. This was supposed to be the book where Katniss stopped being a pawn once and for all and finally takes control of her own life or death if necessary. This was supposed to be the book where Katniss figured out "the effect she has on others" and finally gives honor to the scared girl who volunteered to take her sisters place and began a revolution. Katniss makes no decisions for herself in this final book and the reader is left empty, sad, and begging for an explanation. The biggest element missing from this book was the internal dialogue that let the reader into Katniss's world. We are not only excluded from any meaningful thoughts from Katniss but along with the hurried pace of the book and meaningless chapters following Katniss around as she hides in closets I feel like I have witnessed the final piece of Katniss die and nothing was left to make it worth it.
