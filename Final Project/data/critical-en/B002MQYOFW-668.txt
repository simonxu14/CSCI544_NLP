This one starts out pretty slow, and I found the ending pretty unsatisfying.  There are several unsatisfying parts for me at the end, the biggest being her choice between Gale and Peeta.  They put so much emphasis in all the books on her torment of her feelings for the 2 of them, and I felt like they didn't give her final choice the gravitas it deserved.  Overall, still OK, and you still have to read it if you read the 1st 2, but definitely my least favorite of the 3.
