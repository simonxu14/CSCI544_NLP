Great book and I would give it five stars, but I would expect that it would last longer than a week with very gentle care.  The pages started coming out right away.  For a reference book on Pokemon, they know kids are going to be using and using over and over again so they should bind it properly or publish it in with a spiral binder.  Very disappointed.
