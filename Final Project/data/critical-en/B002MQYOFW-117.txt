Title: Mockingjay<br />Author: Suzanne Collins<br />My Rating - 3.5-4 Stars<br /><br />I'd like to begin my review of Mockingjay by saying that I laughed my butt off when Liz Lemon of 30 Rock made a comment about sinking into Peeta Mellark's embrace -- his arms that 'smell like bread'.  Hilarious.  Nice to know that those of us reading YA who are not that Y ourselves are not alone.<br /><br />SPOILERS included.  Do not read if you've not read the book.  This is a late review, not a new release...<br /><br />GOOD STUFF<br />I have to give this book a 3.5 - 4 Stars for overall satisfaction.  It ends in the manner that it should and it wraps up all the loose ends nicely and believably.  Like the other books, the author is true to Katniss throughout.  It is clear that Katniss did not ever want to be a revolutionary, she just wanted to keep her little sister from harm as she began doing when her father died and her mother had a breakdown.  Throughout the entire story, this is Katniss' MO.  Even though she agrees to be the Mockingjay and serve as the symbol of the rebellion, she disobeys their orders and wishes as regularly as she does the Capitol's.  Neither faction can control her and she realizes that the rebel leader, President Coin is as much a danger to her as President Snow in the Capitol.  In the end, a great injustice is done to Katniss as her only mission fails and Prim is killed.  It is clear that Coin allowed her onto the battlefield.  What is unclear is whether it is Gale's trap that ends her life...or the Capitol's.  Unable to be certain, and sure that Coin and Gale are nearly as wrong as Snow, Katniss makes her choice at the execution and shoots Coin instead of Snow.  It is her last act as the Mockingjay.  The war is over, she  is pardoned and she returns to a newly rebuilding District 12 with Peeta, where they live out their lives with their children.<br /><br />Favorite Scenes<br />Katniss' visit to District 8 hospital and subsequent battle<br />Katniss sings The Hanging Tree to Pollux and the Mockingjays<br />Finnick and Annie's Wedding<br />Katniss and Peeta at peace, their love in balance, their children safe<br /><br />CRITICAL STUFF<br />After Catching Fire, I expected to be blown away by Mockingjay and for the first 60% of it, I really was impressed.  However, when they get to the invasion of the Capitol, I have to admit, she started to lose me.  The revisitation of the Hunger Games finally wore me down.  The idea that the center of the city would have hundreds of intensely diabolical booby traps seemed off to me.  Would those never have gone off in the course of everyday life and caused some type of disastrous accident?  I guess it's supposed to underscore how messed up Snow is, but it felt a little unrealistic somehow.  I also think it dragged.  My capacity to focus on yet another violent trap waned.  Also, she introduced the new character, Tigress, in the midst of this section and I found her hard to relate to as well.<br /><br />Media Stuff/Propos - I did get a little tired of Katniss being dressed up, made up, and followed around by cameras.  The whole media angle is interesting, but it may have been too much for me.  That being said, the single strongest moment in the entire book for me is when Katniss is filmed in District 8 after the bombing and declares, "IF WE BURN, YOU BURN WITH US!"  That gave me goosebumps.  Dead on!<br /><br />Gale - In this book Katniss and Gale connect more than they ever have (while conscious) in the previous books.  To me, it was the chance to finally understand this great love story...and then it seemed to fall apart before my eyes.  Though a handful of times Gale and Katniss share a kiss or engage in some act of kindness toward one another, the reality is that Gale chooses the rebellion over Katniss and she knows it.  She is shocked by his bloodlust, particularly when she gets to see it in action.  When she connects his double-bomb to Prim's death, she cannot unthink it and the tenuous thread of their love is permanently severed.<br /><br />Peeta - Lots of bloggers took some issue with Peeta's 'hijacking'.  I actually found that compelling and believable.  It's like A Clockwork Orange...psychological conditioning is an old idea and she just took it to an extreme.  It worked because it forced Katniss to live without an utterly devoted Peeta and think about what that was like.  Though it's Finnick that points out that she obviously has some sort of love for Peeta, Katniss seems to be finally figuring that out for herself.  It was so obvious to me throughout that Peeta was going to recover and that Peeta was going to be 'The One'.  Who in the heck else could it have been?  He devoted his life (and nearly gave it over and over) to save her because he loved her, not because he had any agenda.  In fact, he is the only character in the entire thing that has no other agenda besides saving Katniss' life.  Everyone else manipulates her at some point.  In some ways, this even includes Prim, who pushes her to use her power as the Mockingjay.  The idea that Peeta would not be the One in the end was just never believable to me.<br /><br />Coin - The author never once gives Katniss any positive connection with Coin.  From the very first time she meets her, she dislikes the perfection of her hair and tension rules their relationship.  For this reason I never saw Coin's targeting of Katniss in the final scenes as much of a 'secret twist'.  Katniss knew Coin didn't like her, she just didn't realize Coin wanted her dead...but for the reader that is not a stretch.  Also, Katniss' decision to kill Coin in the end.  I saw that coming a mile away.  She knew that the others would kill Snow.  Everyone wanted to kill Snow.  But she thought that Coin arranged Prim's death and so she took her revenge.  That is one thing I do like, the fact that Katniss stuck to her love of Prim to the end.  Though she saw Coin as dangerous, Katniss has seen enough of humanity to have decided that any leader could be or become evil.  That was not why she killed her.  She killed her because Coin killed Prim, period.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen - The Hunger Games Movie Poster<br />I loved Katniss, I loved the story.  I don't know how they will make these movies because the story is so incredibly violent, but I know I will be right there to see them.  For your enjoyment, I included this promotional movie poster for you.  Katniss is played by a relatively new talent in Jennifer Lawrence.  Good bye Bella Swan, Hello Katniss Everdeen...
