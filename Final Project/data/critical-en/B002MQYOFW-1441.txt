Let me start by saying that I read all three books in 3 days. They were THAT hard to put down.<br /><br />After reading the first two, I couldn't wait to read the last. I almost wish I hadn't.<br /><br />Yes, the book was action packed and intriguing, but the charm of the first two books was nonexistent. The lovely scenes between Peeta and Katniss were few and far between, if at all. That was the thing I most loved in the first two books. The book left me feeling depressed and angry.<br /><br />The end felt rushed and thrown together. Characters you grew to love and root for were needlessly killed off. I wish I had stopped after book 2. :(
