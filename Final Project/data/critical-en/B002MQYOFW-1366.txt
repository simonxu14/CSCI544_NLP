After devouring the Hunger Games books in under a week, I felt very empty.  The first two bittersweet books left hope for a happier end, which I expected would come in the third book, Mockingjay.  Instead, Mockingjay turned out to be a thesis against war with shattering effects on the characters, one in particular which left me crying even after I put the book down.  Since the first two books were about breaking the system, I didn't expect the system to break the characters at the end.  I'm glad I didn't read other reviews of Mockingjay in advance because I wouldn't have wanted to know the plot, but I think it's worth knowing that it's very sad.<br /><br />The end of Mockingjay made me think about the importance of supporting our veterans and how we as a community can help them live better lives and recover after the horrible things that they have seen.  Here, I would like to plug The Mission Continues, a non-profit that empowers wounded and disabled veterans to recover begin new lives of public service.  I have donated to them in the past and this book has encouraged me to do so again.
