I found the hunger games good and easy to read. I picked up the series after reading Game of Thrones. The dialogue of GOT is what makes it such a great series. The characters are vivid and their habits and mannerisms bleed onto the page. I feel that The Hunger Games lacked this detail. The story seemed to be linear, basic and focused. Not much detail was painted for the supporting cast. It is a good read and I did enjoy it, however I wouldn't put it up as one of my favorites.
