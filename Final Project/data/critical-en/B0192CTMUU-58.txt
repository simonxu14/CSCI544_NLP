I needed a hardcover book to replace the one in my set.  The &#34;hardcover&#34; book I received was a paperback book that was rebound with a hardcover.  Having been a children's librarian, I know the paper is higher in acid and will not survive the test of time.  I would have returned it but I let my 8 year old open the package. She's reading the series and just finished the previous book and already had to wait a few days for it to arrive.
