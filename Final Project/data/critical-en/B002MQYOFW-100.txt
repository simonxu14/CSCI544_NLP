To begin with, I read this on my kindle. It's possible that the grammatical and spelling errors that populated &#34;Mockingjay&#34; were the subject of a bad software adaptation, or (more damning) a rushed production deadline. I debated between assigning one and two stars to &#34;Mockingjay&#34; and ultimately settled on one, because it represented such a disappointing fall-off from the first book. The plot was full of holes, the character interactions were wooden and predictable in bad ways (then unpredictable in worse ways), and ideas were introduced without suspense, relevence or explanation. I found myself rooting for the antagonists, hoping against hope that the rebellion would be crushed - then, at the end, my dislike for the plot and its characters was rewarded by the book and trilogy concluding in the most inhuman and philosophically offensive way possible. If you loved the first book in this series you should read the second book - but don't read this one. Your imagination can furnish a much better ending than the one provided by Suzanne Collins.
