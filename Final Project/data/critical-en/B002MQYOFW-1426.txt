Seeing this book listed as a children's books and hearing reviews of the movies, I decided to read the series for myself.  Once you complete the first book, you just have to find out what happens to the main characters.  That said, it is definitely not a book I would want my children reading.  I think this book would be most appropriate for ages 20 and up.  I loaned my Kindle to a friend, a retired English teacher, and she gave it back the next time I saw her.  She said it was way too disturbing even for her.
