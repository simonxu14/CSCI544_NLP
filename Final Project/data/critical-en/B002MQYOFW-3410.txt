Kindle told me I had ordered this book--but I hadn't- had ordered only a loaner during the last few days of my freefire program---I beganto read it and it quit, Amazon told me that my order had run out though I had never ordered it'''got that Kindle Fire Xmas and still haven't used it yet--the first one was frozen and you sent a second machine---Kindle and Amazon customer service reps. seem to be from India and I cannot understand their dialect.. overall it's been a rotten experience.
