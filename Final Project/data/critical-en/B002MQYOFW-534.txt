I loved the first book, The Hunger Games!  I really liked the second book, Catching Fire.  This third and final fizzled out for me.  A little heavy on the drama.  The heroine & hero are not so much.  More like a tragedy.  And the narrator is not very good at the boy/men character voices.  Makes Peeta sound like Rudolph the red nosed reindeer; the part where he had the fake nose and sounded like he had a nose cold!  She did a great job on the female characters, however.
