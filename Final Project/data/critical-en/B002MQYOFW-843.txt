I truly enjoyed the first two books. The first half of this book was really good as well. And then I felt like the author suddenly had pressure to get it finished. It seemed rushed and I especially didn't like how the ending was presented. For example, the whole relationship between Katniss and Peeta was a big thing all the way through the books and then for her to choose him officially with a sentence or two just seemed incredibly anti-climatic. Truthfully, it felt like it does when you're watching a TV series and at the very end someone else entirely writes the last couple of episodes and it feels like they didn't even belong with the series. I hope they change up the way the ending is presented in the movies when they come out.
