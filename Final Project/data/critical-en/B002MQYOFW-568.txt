This was a good book. There was action and mystery. But at some parts it's just a little to confusing. It turns out well I guess at the end but... SPOILER ALERT!!!!! In the end Katniss doesn't live with he  mother any more. She doesn't live with Gale either. The rest you find out. If you've  been reading the Hunger Games you should read it.
