After Catching Fire, I was on the edge of my seat awaiting the conclusion to this series.  I was so disappointed in Mockingjay.  It really didn't seem like it was written by the same author.  Katniss is not the same girl we grew to love.  She isn't on fire here.  Also, the deaths of other key players are so unceremonious and lackluster.  It's just not the same writing.  It's as if she was just ready to be done and she just let the chips fall where they may.  Sorry Suzanne.
