This review is based simply on the file, not on the books themselves.  This file made my Kindle behave strangely.  Every chapter became a completely different size than the last previous setting, and a page turn sometimes flipped 20 pages ahead or back from where I was.  I haven't had this problem with any other e-books that I've had.  I've been reading other books since, not a single problem. It is specifically this file.<br /><br />BUY ALL THREE BOOKS SEPARATELY. Save yourself the headache.
