I liked this book as well as the first two but there are a few key moments that make me feel disappointed or wanting more. First, I didn't mind that Prim died but I feel like many of the characters especially Gale didn't even care. Second, I don't understand why Katniss` mother didn't even visit her in the hospital or even when she was sent home. You would think a person who has lost her daughter and husband would at least spend some time with her last living daughter. I really didn't care about Katniss choosing Gale or Peeta but I feel like Gale and Katniss were such good friends and really understood one another that he would of least said goodbye to her before she returned to district 12 or at least visited her in the months when she was regaining her strength and will to live. Overall I liked the book especially when she killed Coin and I knew that this book would focus more on war and Katniss struggling to come to terms with who she is and what she did. I also was glad that there was an epilogue.
