spoilers. this book started out with great potential. katniss was finally in a setting where she could take some control of the plot and really develop into a full character without the all encompassing Â«need to surviveÂ» thing that was keeping her flat and dominated the first two books...<br /><br />there was also a great opportunity to develop the relationship between gale and katniss which i was very excited for. katniss was also with her mother and sister which had alot of potential for character development and interaction as they were hardly in the previous books. unfortunately none of this happened. as a matter of fact nothing much happened throughout the book. i was waiting for the endless mental/psychological torment of katniss to end so the plot could move on...i mean i know she cared about peeta but for goodness sake it was ridiculous! considering she had gale and her family and a chance to fight the capitol...<br /><br />but thats not all. the plot itself was sloppy and all to convient...patches of action thrown in at places that dont make sense...and the characters like gale and prim got ripped off and ignored, only there in name. the author obviously had no idea where to go with the plot or how to end things so it rambled and went nowhere...then she just started killing off tons of people at the end...and it was just a huge disappointed, badly written, and i hope the movie can somehow fix this mess from the author.
