Let me start out by saying as a whole, I really enjoyed the series. Hands down, The Hunger Games is easily my favorite book of the whole trilogy and in my opinion, the strongest. I felt like it went downhill after the first book, but not so downhill that I wish the sequels weren't written at all. I just wish that they had lived up to how I felt about the first book.<br /><br />What I found weak about Mockingjay was also what made it strong, which was withdrawn Katniss because of all the trauma she had experienced in the previous two books. Especially with what happened to Peeta, who had become her touchstone to normalcy in a sense. However, while probably realistic (I've never actually been in combat), it didn't make for the best read if that makes sense. It seemed to lack something extra--I called it a spark in my review for Catching Fire. For some reason, the story itself felt incredibly flat to me. While I couldn't not read it because I needed to find out what happened to all the characters, I didn't devour it like I did with The Hunger Games.
