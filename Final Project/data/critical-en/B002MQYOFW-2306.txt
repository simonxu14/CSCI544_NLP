I read this book because it was $5 on Kindle, and the ladies at my job wouldn't stop talking about it. I didn't care. and that is a problem. Katniss is not likable. Neither is Lisbeth Salander from Dragon Tattoo, but she made me care. There are long stretches talking about hunger and thirst, so boring.  The world the author attempted to build was thin and sparse. And I am not "crying racism", but the only "dark brown" people from the 1. same district 2. who worked in fields 3. that sang to communicate and 4.That had a moon as it's "symbol"? GTFOH. I don't understand why Katniss didn't bring the plants from the other side of the fence to her back yard. The over-all positive attitude of the people in the Capital. The Hunger Games is a punishment, stop treating it like a fun prize with fabulous food and clothes. It was all over the place. Probably like my review is. Also I didn't laugh once. Any good book, no matter the genre will make you laugh at least once. Not this one.
