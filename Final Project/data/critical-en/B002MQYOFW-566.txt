The first book was great. The second, worse. The third was so sad that once I realized it gets worse through the book I almost can't bring myself to finish. I hoped for a happy ending but got just the opposite. My mom didn't want me reading these until I was thirteen but after watching the first two movies I was very persistent. She eventually gave in but I wish she hadn't. First one I would recommend and the second is an okay follow up until they suck you in. The sadness in the third really truly was not necessary.
