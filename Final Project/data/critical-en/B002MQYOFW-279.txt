I wanted the heroine to transform into what the first two books began.  I am verrrryyyyyy melancholy concerning the ending.  It is a psychological ride that ends in crashing into a wall.  I wonder how the third movie will edit this: true to book or Americanize it with positivity and candycoat  the hardships and trials and tragedies...
