I enjoyed the first two books of this series alright; they were light reads typical of the YA genre, and while they weren't masterpieces, they were fun. Mockingjay, however, has earned my unmitigated exasperation. I didn't like anything about the book. Unlike the first two, this was a chore to read. I had to force myself through this book.<br /><br />I hated Katniss the whole time. I understand that she was traumatized, but it felt incredibly contrived. She kept getting knocked out, and when she would wake up, people would tell her about important advancements in the story that happened while she was unconscious. That's lazy writing. Even when Katniss is conscious for important events, her thoughts aren't very lucid. After the way Katniss acted in this book, I don't want to hear anyone describe her as brave or strong again. She actually spends a good amount of the book hiding, and she doesn't face her problems. When she does finally pull it together to go on the battlefield, it's to hurry up and end the story.<br /><br />I also didn't like how anyone died in the book. They would be killed off in a sentence, and I couldn't bring myself to feel any sympathy for them. It wasn't a numb feeling from shock; I just couldn't have cared less.<br /><br />Overall, this book isn't very good. I am so tired of people praising it.
