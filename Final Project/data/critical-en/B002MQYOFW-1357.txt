Well written, easily digested and enjoyable. I wouldn't buy any further books on the same theme because it looks as if the first book pretty much squeezed all the juice out of the idea.<br />However would definitely recommend it if you like sci-fi. If the author has a book on a different theme would be interested to read it. The price is also excellent.
