Most of the 2 days I spent reading this book I wanted to kick Harry in the face. I found it very disappointing that Rowling found it neccessary to make him the stereotypical teenager, when plenty of people go through adolescence and maintain a normal attitude and way of thinking. There were far fewer comic elements to this book and I missed them sorely. If Harry is just as bratty in the 6th novel, I'll stop reading it halfway through. I think Rowling is abusing her power as an author.
