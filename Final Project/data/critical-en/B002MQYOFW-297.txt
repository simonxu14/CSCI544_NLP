I found the books a little plodding, but overall I enjoyed the storyline, and first book the most.  Book two had exhausted the most interesting aspects of the storyline, and book three is irritating. It is one thing to suspend disbelief over muttations, Hunger Games, and the bizarre Capital...but to believe the President is completely occupied with bringing down a 17 year old girl?  : )  Really?  Anyway, I do appreciate the imaginative future world, and its unflinching examination of cruelty, as well as honor.  My main complaint is that the story gets pretty thin by book three.
