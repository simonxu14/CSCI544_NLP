I liked the ending and the feeling of realism the writer managed to create despite the scifi/fantasy genre. This is not a fairytale with everything sweet and pink and I wasn't looking for that so I was quite happy reding it. But somehow the book is a little dull and it won't get you hooked like books I and II.<br /><br />Recommend it anyway.
