After devouing the first two books of this series, The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, I was eager to read Mockingjay- and by it's ending, frustratingly disappointed. Lemme break it down for you.<br /><br />***********************SOME SPOILERS MANY EXIST IN THIS REVIEW- read at your own risk. **************************<br /><br />1. Katniss' rapid decline in character development: While I understand the desire to reflect the toll war has taken on Katniss, to leave us with a shell of who she once was is not only poor writing, but a very depressing and uninspired view of our capacity as people to heal and recover. I believe it could have been quite possible to show how her participation in multiple Hunger Games and a bloody revolution left her jaded- but not completely hopeless and broken. Sadly, even as she looks on at her children from a happy life with her love Peeta, our author can barely muster enough hope and peace to make this ending satisfying.<br /><br />2. While I am extremely happy that the Peeta/Gale/Katniss love triangle does not take center stage and is merely an aspect of a greater story, the resolution is extremely lackluster. After three books of mounting tension (both angry and sexual), much spit swapped with each male suitor, and Katniss constantly ping-ponging between the two, we find out in a SINGLE PARAGRAPH that she has chosen Peeta. Her reasoning is realistic and a well written paragraph sure, but still a SINGLE paragraph. Reaaaaally poor wrap-up.<br /><br />-The revolution throughout the whole book is inspired and promising- even allowing some understanding (though still a bit of annoyance) as the rebels (District 13) fight for a cause, but still show undertones of the same inescapable Capitol oppression that must occur for "true freedom" to exist (So it would seem our author believes).<br />Yet as the character of president Coin is reduced to just another power hungry oppressor, it seems clear that the only option is to murder her (Why? It wrapped up too quickly for us to quite comprehend).<br /><br />Overall, this book focuses too much on making the war and its aftermath real, ugly and painful. But what the author fails to do is recapture that spark of hope in freedom that hooked most readers in the first book- the defiance that Katniss first showed in the arena, Peeta's humanity and never-fading horror at the easy disposal of human life, Gale's unwavering support of Katniss no matter what separated or threw them together.<br /><br />Sadly, all of these hopeful and redeeming aspects are abandoned in the end for what appears to be a bigger message -WAR IS BAD. i highly recommend the first two books, but then I would skip the third and instead read the following sentances for closure:<br /><br />Rebels win. Capitol falls. Katniss chooses Peeta. Yay. The end.
