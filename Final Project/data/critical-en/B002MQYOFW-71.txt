I thought 1 and 2 were very good.  However this one is not so.  Several issues.  First Katnis' personality.  She has become a bit of a teenage Diva.  She demands utter loyalty from everyone but gives little.  If she suspects you of<br />1. not telling her everything she want to know immediately<br />2. of not having approved (by her) thoughts or<br />3. not agreeing with her in every way<br />she cuts you off with a childish temper tantrum and you are not allowed to offer any defence.  (Although the best defence would be "Well get over it who made you the tyrant Queen of everything.) .You then have to come crawling back at least twice and a sufficient period of time out must elapse before you are reluctantly her friend again.  (although now demoted down the friend list).  You also have to show continual contrition and be grateful of your reinstatement and in awe of her mercy.<br />I couldn't finish it.  I started to hope Katnis would get killed off and we could have some of the other characters do something other than fawn at her.<br />In one scene she and another minion shoot down a couple of enemy bomber aircraft with.....bows and explosive arrows???????????<br />Got a third through it and couldnt swallow any more teenage schoolgirl you are not my friend anymore tantrums.
