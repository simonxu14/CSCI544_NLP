AFter reading dozens of reviewers promoting this book, I decided to give it a chance. Fathers and married men, such as myself, were giving it rave reviews, so I figured it couldn't be too juvenile. I was mistaken. As someone who enjoys post apocalyptic, man vs. society literature I was very disappointed by the end of this book, which makes me wish I never would have read it.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD><br /><br />My favorite books in this genre include Brave New World and The Island of Dr. Moreau, both of which were borrowed from heavily in this book. The difference, however, is that these books used a narrative to tell a bigger story with a deeper meaning and used original thought. The horror of people being turned into human-animal hybrids felt real and original in The Island of Dr. Moreau, whereas this revelation in Hunger Games seemed like an after though, with no foreshadowing before and no conclusion after. These hybrids literally come from nowhere for 2 chapters, and then disappear.<br /><br />My biggest problem with the book is that it ends without real resolution. What happened to Peeta's defiant spirit against the Capitol? Why are all the supporting character from the first several chapters never reintroduced to the story? My guess is that this used to sell the rest of the series, but it makes this novel feel very incomplete.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins successfully stole the brilliant, original ideas of at least half-dozen literary works of fiction, used a 16-year-old girl as protagonist, and contrived a pointless love triangle in order to sell books. Did it work? Absolutely. Will anyone care in a decade? Not likely.
