Personally, my belief is that these books should never have been written, especially to be targeted for teens and under.  No child should be subjected to this kind of horror as a form of &#34;entertainment.&#34;  What did it teach with all the brutality that could not have been taught in another way?  My only reason for reading the series, was to find out what my grandchildren were into.  One parent would not let them read any Harry Potter; the other let her boys read them.  Both said this series just slipped thru the crack; they were not paying close enough attention.  They have learned from this.  Do not take this to mean that I believe in government censorship; I definitely do not.  What has happened to our personal censorship?  Does anything go?  These books would have received zero stars, except the one star had to be put in to offer my opinion.
