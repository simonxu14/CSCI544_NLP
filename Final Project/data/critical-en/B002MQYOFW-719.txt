I loved the first two books.  This one was terrible, I actually felt empty and depressed when I finished it, just like a dementor would leave you.  First time in my life I searched for fan fiction endings to &#34;fix it&#34;.  The author might as well have given all of us the middle finger.  I understand the &#34;war is bad message&#34; the ones about greed and human nature but this book goes too far.  In it Katniss personality does a 180 and the ending might as well tell you to just lay down and wait for death because it is not worth it to have even a sliver of hope.
