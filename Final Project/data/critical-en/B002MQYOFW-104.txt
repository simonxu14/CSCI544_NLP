What happened to the hunger games I knew and loved??? The third book ruined it all for me... And no it's not because their was no happily ever after. I ended up despising Katnis by the end.  I read it because I figured at some point it would "go somewhere" but it fell way short. Very disappointed with this one. I would have liked it better if Petta had died ( and I loved Petta).
