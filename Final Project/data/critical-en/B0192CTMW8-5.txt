I ordered what I thought was going to be a new copy of the book.  When I received it, the cover was damaged and some of the pages were slightly bent at the bottom corner, but other than that in good shape.  There was also a recipe that had been torn out of a magazine and placed between the pages, so it was obvious this book was previously owned.  Please don't list it as being brand new if it's used.
