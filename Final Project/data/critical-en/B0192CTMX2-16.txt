Good stuff:<br />1. Hermione and Ron. Their romance moves along at a glacial pace. I'm not sure they are even aware of it, though it's been moving for years. Will their kids all look like Carrottop?<br />2. Umbridge. The scariest words in the English language are: "We're from the government, and we're here to help you." She's a perfect example of why. But wouldn't it have been a better book if she had not been so completely evil?<br />3. Snape. I felt sorry for him. How weird is that?<br />4. Dumbledore. Not omniscient, and doesn't go quietly.<br />5. McGonagall. Gotta love her.<br />6. Padfoot. Wizardry's Most Wanted, and a concerned godfather. And his house elf turns into a full character too.<br />7. Trelawney. Who knew?<br />8. The Weasleys. All of them. Someday, Harry'll be even more part of the family than he is already.<br />9. The Malfoys and their minions. Especially the grown-ups, who replace their children as Harry's foes. Oddly, the evil kids don't seem to be growing nearly as fast as the good guys.<br />10. Longbottom. Speaking of how fast the good guys are growing....<br />Rankles:<br />1. Lockhart. Why?<br />2. Hagrid was MIA. Apparently he has gone off to his own spin-off series. I know, what he was doing will be really important in the end, and his relationship with Harry was replaced with Padfoot's. Still, I missed his warmth.<br />3. No Quidditch. Sure, there was too much other stuff going on and no room for it, but it wouldn't have hurt to mention the other 10 games of the season.<br />4. Hermione knew things she couldn't have known. Several times, she just tossed out an amazing statement. Keep it moving, but c'mon.<br />5. When the students stood up to the adults, they were way too good. Sure, they are the heroes and have to prevail in the end, but still, they're just kids.<br />6. Harry slept too well. He has a recurring problem, but then it disappears.<br />37. Chapter 37. Jeez, why have the rest of the story when you just sit down at the end for 25 (!) pages of exposition that tells us what we learn from this whole adventure.
