I have now read all three Hunger Games books and although I am not the direct target audience (young adult) I am disappointed with the last two books in particular. They are too brutal and not a joy to read. I do not understand why such books need to be written as in my opinion it amounts to senseless violence and there is enough of that on TV. I would not recommend these books to anyone.
