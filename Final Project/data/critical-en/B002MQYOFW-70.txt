*SPOILERIFIC*<br /><br />I loved the first two books.  This one just didn't hold up in comparison.<br /><br />It wasn't even really the third book that killed the series for me.  It was the last third of the third book.  The first 2/3 hummed along at a pretty good pace and seemed true to the series.  Then the "Assassin" section came along and was so awful that it darn near undid everything the first 2 2/3 books put together.  At that point I'm guessing Collins decided she had to get out all the things she really wanted to say, the rest of the series (and especially her characters) be damned.  It writing just felt so rushed there.  For the first time, I found myself having to reread bits and pieces to understand what was going on.  Thematically, I suppose I was fine with it, preachiness aside, but the execution was flawed and lazy.  As all the redshirts  got theirs one by one, it all happened so fast that there was never any buildup of tension.  Katniss, Gale, and even Peeta were never in any real danger, not even from each other, and I agree with all the reviewers who are disappointed she spent so much time unconscious during important events.<br /><br />I think having Johanna going nuts was a missed opportunity.  She was a good character, and one of my favorites in Catching Fire.  In addition, she was one of the only characters (in addition to Haymitch) that was able to consistently challenge Katniss.  That Johanna was able to catch Peeta's eye from time to time also made things interesting.  It might have been nice for Katniss to have a real rival (romantically/professionally/whatever) instead of just the struggle against the big bad evil overlord who lives far away.  It was a little boring just having her run roughshod over Gale, Peeta, and the rest of her team.  To have Johanna swept under the rug because she was afraid of water was disappointing.<br /><br />Speaking of Haymitch, it was a disappointment having him MIA for so much of the book.  He was a real star in book 2, and one of my favorite characters in the series overall.  He probably had the best back story of any of the characters, and I think it could have been developed further in 3.<br /><br />I never much cared for Gale, but essentially turning him into a bloodthirsty monster was not cool, and seemed more to be about getting Collins' point of view across and to easily solve the love triangle, rather than any sort of logical character growth.<br /><br />I was able to accept the hijacking of Peeta, unfair as it was, because Katniss had messed with his head for the first two books so much that it seemed like the natural progression.  The real crime, though, was punishing him in the end with a life with her in the tacked on ending and epilogue.  It seemed for a while that his torture had finally given him the self-respect he never had that would have enabled him to stop chasing the girl for a completely one-sided relationship.  The Capitol took so much away from him, but they did give him that.  To have Collins take that away from him in the end, too, was unfortunate.<br /><br />Then there's the ongoing saga of Katniss.  I'm a regular science fiction reader, so suspension of disbelief isn't difficult for me.  Even so, it takes a lot to believe a sixteen/seventeen year-old girl can bring down an entire country and an all-powerful "president"/dictator.  Given that, I appreciate Collins didn't take the easy way out (one of the few times) with regards to her fighting ability and turn her into some kind of super soldier.  Crack shot with a bow or not, she was pretty worthless in the battlefield.<br /><br />But the real kicker with regards to Katniss is this - I'm supposed to believe she's gone to these games twice, seen all this death and destruction, had so much taken away from her, had a wicked case of PTSD, but was still prone to high school level drama BS?  I spent the first two books wondering why there was any struggle in her mind between Peeta and Gale (who sucked on pretty much every level in comparison).  By the end of the third book I was left wondering why either of them would want her.  It's a real unfortunate parallel to the Twilight series, because, for a while at least, Katniss seemed like someone who would have been worth the trouble.<br /><br />When, in the end, she voted for another Hunger Games, and then she killed President Coin instead of former President Snow, it would have been nice to see some of the cognitive processes that went into that.  Even though the punch was telegraphed from a mile away, it would have been nice to see acknowledgement (even afterwards when she is trying to waste herself away on the morphling in the hospital) that it was anything other than a last-second impulse decision on Katniss' part.  She had suspicions of Coin, but she never decided anything concrete one way or the other.  Which, while consistent with character, was still disappointing.<br /><br />The author killing Prim in the way she did just seemed pointless and cruel.  I guess she did it to be "edgy" or whatever, but it was just dues ex machina of the worst kind - that which wasn't even needed to achieve the desired result.  I have doubts that Katniss & Prim's mother would have allowed her to go to the front lines as a medic in the first place.  Also, it doesn't really jibe with reality that the medics would have rushed in like that so quickly.  In a real combat situation, they would have been way far back away from the front lines.  Collins writes it like they were hiding just around the corner, even ahead of most of the rebel troops.  Having Katniss see the bombing and figure it all out would have been justification enough without needlessly (and sloppily...had to read that section several times to see what was happening) killing Prim.<br /><br />In Star Wars terms, The Hunger Games was a good Star Wars.  Catching Fire was a good Empire.  Mockingjay was a bad Revenge of the Sith.
