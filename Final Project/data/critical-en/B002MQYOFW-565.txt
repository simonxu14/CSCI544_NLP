The first book was okay, the second was great and the third (Mockingjay) was terrible. Most of the book is full of drugged or mental ramblings and the ending was just plain ol' blah. The book was written like the author was tired of her characters and just wanted the story to end. I agree with a previous reviewer that said the series could have had the same ending without the such an utter feeling of hopelessness. I bet that the movie will end with a very different feel.
