If you want to maintain hope for an upbeat ending for Katniss your best bet is to imagine how many generations it takes for the children of holocaust victims to put the scars behind them.  I made a mistake in believing that eventually the Hunger Games series would turn into a story of redemption.  I believed Katniss was one in whom the character would eventually come to the fore that would reject playing a game that involved the murder of others as a price of survival.  I believed that good would out.  I thought there was an implied contract with the author that good would eventually find a way to break through all the evil and that Katniss would lead a rebellion analogous to the allies joining hands to defeat the Nazis in WWII.  Instead what the reader who sticks with this series to the end gets is a story that ends in circumstances that are probably more analogous to the survivors of the Rwandan genocide.  The author then attempts to smooth that over by implying that the children of the survivors will not be too severely scarred.  In other words, if you're hoping to find in this series a story of the triumph of good over evil, you might want to tamp down that hope.  I felt betrayed.  The ending was mostly a nightmare followed by an unsatisfactory epilogue about children being born to the victims who survived.  In the end, there is little reason given to hope that Katniss or her spouse would display the psychological stamina, character or wisdom needed to redeem the trauma of the history of abuse, enslavement and evil through which they had lived by showing the character of a Nelson Mandela in the aftermath of South African apartheid.  What we are left with instead is two severely scarred people trying to start a new generation.  History shows that such a scenario is seldom hopeful.
