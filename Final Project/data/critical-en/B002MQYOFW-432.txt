Collins takes us on a tour of a future society (and government) that has lost its moral compass and shares a type of 'sports violence' reminiscent of the gladiatorial contests of ancient Rome. It dramatizes what can happen when government power becomes over reaching and out of control; in this case, pitting teens against each other in a contest to the death. The book is fast paced and written in a style appealing to the YA market. It does leave the reader with some interesting messages to be pondered. I would rate it good but not great.<br /><br />David Faxon
