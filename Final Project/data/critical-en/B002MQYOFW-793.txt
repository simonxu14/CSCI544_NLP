I really enjoyed reading the series, and could not wait to find out what happened so I started reading this one immediately after finishing Catching Fire. Although I couldn't put it down, I was a little disappointed in it. The ending wrapped everything up and told me what I wanted to know, for the most part, but I felt like after devoting 3 books to these characters, I would've liked to know a little more. I don't want to spoil the middle of the book, but I felt like I could've lived with a little less of that part of the story, although I don't honestly know what I would remove, it just seemed that it started to drag on a bit. After all that the characters have been through, especially Peeta and Katniss, I wouldn't expect a fairytale ending (she mentions her psychological issues/nightmares from just the 1st hunger games even in the second book), but I would've liked to have a few questions answered and a little more development to the ending. There were some good twists to the story that I really enjoyed, some that shocked me, and some that made me cry. If you have read the other two, I would definitely finish it up with this one!
