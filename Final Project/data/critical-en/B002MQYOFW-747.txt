A story with a futuristic and bizarre setting is difficult for any author to master. At times the settings were imaginable and at other times - not so much. The idea of putting children as young as twelve into an arena with eighteen year olds was a bit too much to fathom.  The whole idea was bit repulsive. I liked Rau, Prim and the cat. Katniss was wishy-washy and not endearing to this reader.
