Decided to read this book after seeing the movie earlier this year.  It is more violent than books I typically read and disturbing to read about this dystopic society where teenagers are pitted against each other for punishment by the country'  leaders and for sick entertainment of citizens (l guess there is worse levels of reality television beyond Keeping up With the Kardashians and Honey Boo Boo!?!)  Nonetheless,  it is definitely a page turner and Katniss (the main character) is someone who you as the reader are brought to care about and root for.  I am looking forward to Book II and the upcoming movie.  And SPOILER ALERT........finding out if she chooses Peeta or Gale as her love interest.
