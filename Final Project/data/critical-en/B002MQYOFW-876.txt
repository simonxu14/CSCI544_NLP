The action in this book is decent, but the structural issues present in the previous novels that began to rear their head in Catching Fire are full blown in Mockingjay.  Katniss' self-loathing becomes increasingly unbearable until the reader is forced to conclude that if she spent half as much time fighting the enemy as she did discussing what a horrible person she is, this could have been a two book series.  The love triangle, unpleasant from the start, takes a particularly nasty turn as it begins to shine a light on some of the more distasteful aspects of Katniss' character (ex. how selfish she is).<br /><br />Really what this book boiled down to for me is that the main character is just too flawed and in ways that I don't care for.  Nobody want's a Mary Sue to come in with a perfect smile and personality, but the flaws the author chose for the Katniss were particularly off-putting for me.  I've also learned that I need to stay away from books with a love triangle.  I'm not into bodice rippers and outside of something niche like that, I don't see it being done well.
