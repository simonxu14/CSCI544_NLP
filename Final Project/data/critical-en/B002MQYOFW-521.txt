Probably the worst end to a trilogy ever. I get the feeling that the author sat around and thought of the most morbid ways to kill someone and then put all of them in her book.<br /><br />All you need to know is that Katniss sits around for the first half of the book. If I wanted to read someone's whining, I'd visit Facebook for a couple of hours. Then everyone you care about dies (and I'm not talking about the love triangle people).<br /><br />I was depressed for about a week after reading it. When a series like this becomes as popular as it has become, I think the editors are more reluctant to push substantive editing suggestions on the author, which is why this was allowed to be published in its very disappointing form.
