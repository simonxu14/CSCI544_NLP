This was a well written story, but a bit dark. It was kind of draggy at the end and I wish the main character had been a bit more loyal to the guy at the end. I lost interest in the series because of it, didn't feel like reading the next few books where I'm sure she goes back and forth... wasn't strong enough for me to pay alot more for the next books in the series.
