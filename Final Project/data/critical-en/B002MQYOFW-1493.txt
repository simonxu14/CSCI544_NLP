This is book that, perhaps, should not have been written.  There is little new in it and to be truthful, I speed read the last half or so, just to get it over with. Certainly, it does not live up to the promise of the first, or even the second in the series. However, I know that others will love it and good luck to them.  It just disappointed me a little bit!
