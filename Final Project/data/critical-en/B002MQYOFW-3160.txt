My girlfriend and I spontaneously went and saw the movie adaptation for the first book on a date. She was adamant that we purchase the books afterwards. We did, and as I am a fast reader, I had the first book read in roughly a day. No problems there-- the first book is a complete story, well worded and concise. But from there it goes downhill. The second book is a clumsy attempt to involve a subplot, which comes off as a fanfic tack-on. That being said, I still wasn't that turned off by the second book. I was in for a rude awakening with the third book, though. Collins tries (and fails) to incorporate a gargantuan story into thinly worded conversation that is the equivalent of listening to a concerto composed by a Rhesus monkey. The last 70 pages or so in particular contain some of the worst prose imaginable, tied together with one of the most amateur, poorly thought out plots I've ever seen. If I could return this set to the author, I would. Terrible.
