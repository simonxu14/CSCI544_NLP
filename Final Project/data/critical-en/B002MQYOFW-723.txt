The overall plot is good, but there were two things that bothered me.  The editing / flow / style seemed very different from the first two, almost as if the author was rushed.  But most significantly is the atrophy of the main character.  The once strong Katniss is listless and dull.  Even in the midst of her heroism near the end she seems as though she doesn't care at all about anyone, anything... making it hard for this reader to embrace her character, and harder still to understand why any other character would want to, either.
