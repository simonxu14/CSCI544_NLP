The first 2 books were good, sometimes things got a little too repetitive, that same old &#34;gotta save Peeta&#34; story, but that was alright. Then, on the 3rd book things went dull. And at the end, it looks like the author herself got so bored she just had to get it over with and go find something else to do. Not that it didn't have to end that way, but it was so poorly written!<br />I'm not saying I regret buying the books, I really don't. I guess I'm not what they call &#34;target audience&#34;. I think that if you are older than 30, maybe you should find something else to read.
