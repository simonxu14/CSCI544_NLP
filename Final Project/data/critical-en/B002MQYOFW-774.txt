I became addicted to this book series and read them all in a few days. I was obsessed.This trilogy started off so strong through story detail and the building of character relationships, but by the end, it felt like Collins lost her train of thought. The lack of detail to what was happening and almost nonexistent character relationships that we all fell in love with are why I was severely disappointed with this book. It felt like Collins was rushed and got sloppy by the end. All of a sudden certain characters are just gone with little to no explanation. Throughout the trilogy there was a build up of suspense as to which boy catniss really loved, and when she finally realized which guy she needed in her life, there is about a paragraph dedicated to it on almost the last page. After i finshed it, i just sat there confused as to what happened (or lack of what happened).The ending felt so incomplete that it left me depressed for days. This is the first time i have ever hoped for a movie adaptation of a book series to change the material (and I am one of those people that reads a book and then doesn't want it changed at all when transitioning to the screen). Now, I am hoping for the movie Mockingjay to fulfill what the book left vacant.
