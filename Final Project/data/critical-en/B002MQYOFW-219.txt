I am not totally sold on this book.  It really does control the reader, while other books give you time to think about other solutions to problems or what might happen next.  This book is just too controlling, which is the way the games are played.  The actual games are exciting but what comes before and what comes right at the end is a big cop out by the author IMHO.  I can't tell the end results but I do still feel manipulated.  And I am going to try to see the movie ASAP, just to see how close it comes to the book. No, I enjoyed the book, but do not see all the great reviews and reaction it has obtained.
