I felt strangely lacking at the end of this book.  Don't get me wrong, it was brilliantly written like her other two books, but I was so upset with most of it.  I was frustrated with the relationship between Katniss and Gage? (I can't remember her friend's name now, oops) and most of all with the relationship between her and Peeta.  I felt that their relationship most of all needed more closer or something, I don't know.  I just didn't think that most of the things that happened to Katniss, needed to happen.  I think she had experienced enough loss and pain that enough was enough, and the ending was just a little overboard.  I'm just not sure I liked this book, I know it was my least favorite of the 3 books.  I'm thinking I'll read the trilogy over again and maybe add to the review if my opinion changes.  Read for yourself and see what you think...
