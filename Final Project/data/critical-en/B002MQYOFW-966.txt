I loved the Hunger Games and the second book was enjoyable as well.  However, the third installment makes a departure from worked so well with the first two books.  The protagonist becomes a "Public Relations" character and deals with internal struggles.  The drama and intense excitement of the arena was missing.  The overall tone of the novel was depressing and the ending literally made me wince.  With that said, please feel free to complete the series, but don't expect the brilliance of the first novel.
