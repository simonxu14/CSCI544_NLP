I felt this book was alittle more dragged out. I found myself skimming paragraphs just to get to the point. I won't give anything away, but I did not like the ending. It ruined the whole trilogy for me. What I did appreciate was the fact I could find all the books in a large print. I do not have eye troubles, but it sure did help. I will not be a Hunger Games addict anymore.
