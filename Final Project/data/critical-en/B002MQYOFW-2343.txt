I LOVE The Hunger Games. The entire series is fantastic and if you're considering reading it, I highly recommend it. But don't get the audiobooks. I bought the audiobooks for my mom because my sister and I wanted her to read it and we knew she would prefer to listen to it so she could do other things at the same time. All three of us were extremely disappointed. The reader, Carolyn McCormick, does not do any of the characters justice (except Effie, she does narrate Effie well). Her use of tone and inflections are not true to the characters and do not capture the characters' personalities. McCormick's tone throughout the entire book distorts the story.If you are looking to read the Hunger Games, the story is more thrilling and the characters are more likeable when you actually read it as opposed to listen to it. These audiobooks do not do this great story justice.
