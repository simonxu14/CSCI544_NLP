I enjoyed the first two book immensely. Then when I got to just about the end of the third book it fell apart and I couldn't finish reading it knowing that the author rushed the ending and gave up. The author should be ashamed of herself for such crap at the end of the book. SPOILER: I'm not upset that Prim died. I'm upset that it was written like a dream and that Katniss didn't rush in to kill Snow during the war. I kept reading that chapter thinking it will just be a crappy written dream chapter and she'll wake up on the battlefield and continue towards her goal. Instead we get a bulleted list of events that happend...Coin wins the war, Snow is captured blah blah....<br /><br />Author....YOU. SHOULD. BE. ASHAMED. What a terrible, lazy ending!!!
