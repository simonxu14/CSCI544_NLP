I absolutely LOVE The Hunger Games Trilogy. I've read the books many times and then purchased the audio book for a friend to listen to in her car on her route to and from work. The narrator Carolyn McCormick is awful! I couldn't stand listening to her, she did not read the story the way I read it in my head. She made the characters sound whiny. Which they are not. This is a great series and should be read.
