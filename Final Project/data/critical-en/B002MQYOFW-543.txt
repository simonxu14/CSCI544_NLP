Due to the popularity I decided to give this series a go. I didn't like the first person present tense. Rarely does it work, and it didn't here. I didn't like the fact that the heroine is a tool who can't do anything for herself. Granted she's 17, but that' sold enough to be a better role model. Her one redeeming quality comes far too late in this series - the very end. My 3 stars is based solely on the creativity of the writer and how through all the faults I have mentioned has still given us a believable world (okay, maybe not all of the Capitol scenes in Mockingjay),
