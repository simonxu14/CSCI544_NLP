I think Mocking Jay was an ok addition to the Hungar Games series but it wasn't the best one. You kinda have to read it though in order to full fill your Hungar Games craving, but compare it to Catching Fire or the 1st Hungar Games, it wasn't as action pacted or exiting. I still liked the book but it wasn't my favorite one in the series.
