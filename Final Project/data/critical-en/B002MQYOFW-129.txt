Alas, it saddens me to write this review.... The conclusion of this trilogy leaves the reader feeling deprived and cheated. Katniss becomes a mere shell of the brillant, strong character you embrace in book one. This story concludes by lacking everything I originally loved in the beginning of the trilogy.
