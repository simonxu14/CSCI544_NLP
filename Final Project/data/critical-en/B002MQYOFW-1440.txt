Bought this for granddaughter. She called me today to say that in the Mockingjay book there are duplicate chapters and also whole pages missing, So,  at the moment not too happy with this purchase! I'm sure it's too late to get a refund , since she took a while to start reading it, but someone didn't check this look very closely. So if anyone is buying this box set - beware!!!!!!'
