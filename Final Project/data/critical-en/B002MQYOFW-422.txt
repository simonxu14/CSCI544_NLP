How can this be called a book for young adults?  My BA is in English which means I have read LOTS of books.  In my younger days I was a fanatical reader of Science Fiction, so I'm very familiar with that genre.  I found this 3-part series horrific.  There are quite a large number of wording and grammatical errors, which always bother me, but the sheer human suffering at the hands of other people is profoundly upsetting to me, and a poor example for youth.  I realize the author is trying to make a point, but you can always watch a horror movie if you want a quick sickening fix.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.
