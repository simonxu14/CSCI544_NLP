The problem with this book is that once you read book two, you ahve to read book three.  You can stop after book one and be satisfied, book two is awesome, but book three just seems like it gets tired at the end.  The last third is somewhat confusing in narration (departing from the artful narration of the rest of the series), and many things happen that aren't carefully explained or told in a mesmerizing way.  The plot overall is satisfactory, but this is one of those books that I hope come out with an &#34;extended cut&#34; to finish out the missing or incomplete parts of the story.  If you read two, read three, just don't expect the close of this story to pull you in like the rest of the series.
