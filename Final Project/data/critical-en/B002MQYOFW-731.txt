Having read the other books of the trilogy, I've become very impressed with S. Collins writing. This book last book let me down. The writing and story felt rushed and vastly different from the struggle survivals of the previous two books.<br /><br />I did enjoy an insight into the rebellion as well as vastly expanded cast of multidimensional characters who all had their own motivations, some good some bad.<br /><br />Read it if your a fan of the trilogy, otherwise skip it.
