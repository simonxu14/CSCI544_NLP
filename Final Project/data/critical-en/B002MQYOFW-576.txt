I was really dissapointed with this book to say the least. The first twwo were so great and this just seemed rushed. They killed off important characters in like two sentences for no good reason number one, and then katniss actually like trusts snow... I don't care if he was right she hates his guts. Also gale is like her best friend he doesn't eceb visit here after all they have been thrum really...this book Mindanao sucked. And worst off all is the ending. She has kids with peeta. Thrum the whole book she doesn't even like him that much and she doesn't fight for him when hes derranged. Ugh did not like this at all.
