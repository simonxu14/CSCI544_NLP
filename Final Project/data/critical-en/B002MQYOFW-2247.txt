I thought Hunger Games was good. I thought Catching Fire was repetitive and pointless. I thought Mockingjay was a disgrace. The fact that this series is receiving so much acclaim is really an indication that the people of this world are as superficial as the literary Capitolians in these novels and can be entertained by poorly written, scattered story lines full of violence and nonsense. Honestly, I think Collins was a Team Jacob fan from the Twilight series and published these books to bring justice to Jacob by having Katniss end up with Peeta (spoiler alert, sorry). If you've read the two series, think about the parallels... supernatural beings (vampires and muttations), all powerful controlling body (Volturi and the Capitol), gory war violence, a normal girl torn between two men she loves while trying to protect her family from the reality of the situation, two attractive men trying to protect the one girl they love while she resists the idea of marriage and children, etc. etc. Overall, Mockingjay lacks character development, lacks a consistent story line, lacks dimension. You lose interest in the protagonists and the antagonists, and you're left feeling sorry for the few people in the plot who were genuinely happy with their lives because they die violently for really no reason. It's such a jumbled mess that the ending is actually perfect and expected considering how nonsensical the rest of the book is. Also, Collins needs some work in learning to illustrate scenes and people with detail... use more appeal to the senses and the imagination instead of being so technical and boring. Another thing that kills me is every time she doesn't know how to describe an event, she just conveniently has Katniss black out for a while. I guess that's a perk of being the author, but it sucks to be the reader. Don't waste your time getting involved in this series because they get progressively worse.
