After hearing so much about this book series for a great while, i decided to  give it a go. I expected so much from this, especially after reassuring myself by looking over all the reviews, and purchasing the entire set in one go. I read the books over a period of 4 days, waiting and hoping that something fantastic and marvelous would eventually happen to create the "unforgettable" and "revolutionary" memory of these books in my mind. I finished each book, not out of the pure excitement and suspense of the next turn in events, but out of anger. I was mad because the book was in my mind, another Twilight. Everybody raved about it, and when it came down to it, really had no depth. The main character was an unrelateable teenager who constantly made poor decisions in attempts of fulfilling angsty wishes and made the book a frustrating read. I have made an active duty in attempting to stray people away from the surface-level characters and poor and unimaginative descriptions. It is understandable that this is for teenagers, and it may have a better moral compass than Twilight, it really just wasnt worth the hype.
