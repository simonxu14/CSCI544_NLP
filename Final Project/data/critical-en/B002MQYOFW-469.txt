This book was an utter disappointment!!!!  It seems the author got tired and just stopped using her imagination!  We follow the plight of Gail all through the trilogy and form an emotional bond with him only to have him land in a foreign district with a really good job - gone without saying goodbye. Everyone who was anyone in the book ends up gone from her life without any fanfare!  I wish I had saved both my time and money with this book!
