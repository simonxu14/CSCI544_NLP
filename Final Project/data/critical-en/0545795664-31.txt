I bought this book for my son less than a month ago and it is falling apart. It started with one page about three days after receiving the book and I just taped it back into place, however, it went down hill from there. That section has grown to 100 pages that have fallen out, as well as two other smaller sections that are growing daily. This is very disappointing for my Pokemon loving boy and I!
