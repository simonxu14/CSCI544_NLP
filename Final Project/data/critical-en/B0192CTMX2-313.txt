This book is full of violence and bodies falling right and left. Ironically, with so much sadness expressed over the death of Harry's friends and classmates, the book also promotes death as a good thing. The dead Sirius tells Harry that death is "Quicker and easier than falling asleep." Dumbledore, also now dead, tells Harry that there are far, far worse things" than dying. Other pro-death messages are in the book as well, coming from sources Harry admires or respects. This ties in with the first book when Dumbledore tells young Harry near the end of the book that "to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure." This is not only an unethical message, but also a dangerous one to put in books for young people.<br /><br />As usual, there is a double standard for Harry. Harry can lie and cheat but is infuriated when others do it. For example, Harry and Ron plan to double-cross Griphook, but they are incensed when Griphook double-crosses them first! Hellooooo, Harry, look in the mirror! But this is typical of all the Harry Potter books - and since the books teach that the ends justify the means, this is consistent with that theme.<br /><br />There are a total of ten references in eight consecutive pages to Hermione screaming in pain as she is being tortured. The Gray Lady, a ghost who used to be Helena Ravenclaw, tells Harry how another ghost, the Bloody Baron, when alive, had stabbed and killed her in anger and then killed himself. A story is told about Dumbledore's sister who was driven insane when her "magic . . . turned inward . . . it exploded out of her when she couldn't control it," apparently causing her to kill her mother. This certainly makes for gloomy reading for children!<br /><br />Some have made much of the two Bible quotations on tombstones but these have no Christian context, especially since Harry does not understand them and since the context of the book is so un-Christian. Spells are cast almost on every page in this book and the magic arts, condemned by God, are strongly promoted as good. It is somewhat amusing to see the lengths to which Hermione and Harry must go to cast protection spells as they travel around - no prayers for protection to God as a Christian would do, just complicated spells with a lot of waving wands and incantations.<br /><br />As for the famous protection of "love" from Harry's mother - it's not really her love but that her blood in Harry becomes a magical charm for him and extends to his Aunt Petunia, which is why he's in her home. This charm's protection ends when he turns 17, however - so much for charms!<br /><br />Morality in Harry Potter is defined by what is good for Harry Potter, and what he wants and does. He is the quintessential postmodern, postchristian hero.
