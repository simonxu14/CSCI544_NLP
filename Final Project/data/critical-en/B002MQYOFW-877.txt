I know, the Hunger Games is a big deal. But is it really? The idea of fighting for your life on a reality show is exciting. And that's really what drove this book; the idea. The characters are good, as is the writing. The plot isn't too egregious, either - if you can get past the idea that in order to keep citizens under their control, the government forces children to fight each other to the death on TV.  There needed to be a more valid reason to carry this annual tradition out. It reminded me of the short story The Lottery, by Shirley Jackson. Except that story was written in the 1940s, and is full of symbolism. I'm not sure if Collins was trying to make a similar statement, or if she just liked the idea and figured she'd toss in a dystopian reality TV program to help it catch with a new audience.
