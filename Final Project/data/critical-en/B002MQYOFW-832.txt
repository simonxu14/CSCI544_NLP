The movie may be better that the book. Bought this for my kids, it was as ok read. Does not compare with Harry Potter (5 stars) or Artemis Fowl (4 stars)<br />A lot of it sounds just like run of the mill kid's movies - like Brave, etc.<br />Read all three, then gave away the books. My kids did not read it, and no place in my library for books I only want to read once.
