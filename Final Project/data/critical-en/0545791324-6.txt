It has some very pretty characteristics. However it is a bit creepy and dark. Jim Kay is a wonderful artist but his interpretation on this one versus the Sorcerer's Sone is much darker and much much more bkeak. He did a good job but the lack of color and the amount of decay makes me not want to read this version with kids. I know it would give them nightmares. Don't get me wrong he is a good artist though and you will enjoy it if you like the dark sort of Halloween thing. It doesn't shed the world of Harry Potter in a bright and magical light.
