Ugh!  So disappointed!! =[  The only good part that I liked about this book was who she ends up with in the end. I do know that all stories cannot have everyone live, but jeez.  It seems like everyone I liked in this book died! It just wasn't fair.  Then at the end it's hard to tell what was real and not.  You do eventually, but while you're reading it it gets very confusing.  I was annoyed at the fact of how stupid Katniss became and could not decide basic things.  I guess I just wanted that happy ending, which I do know that all the stuff she went thru would make anyone go a little off the deep end but yeah, majorly disappointed..... =[
