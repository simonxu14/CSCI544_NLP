First off, I adore the first 2 books beyond words.  I love those books and recommend them to anyone who will listen.<br /><br />Mockingjay seemed like it was written by a completely different author.  I couldn't put down the first 2 books, but it was so odd that I dreaded picking up Mockingjay.  The book was a lot of "huh?" "what?"  "now who is that?"  "what just happened?" "where are they again?"... then the last chapter tried to tie everything into a pretty little box.  It was bizarre!<br /><br />Sorry to be harsh, but if you loved the first 2 books, don't read this one.  It will ruin the series for you.
