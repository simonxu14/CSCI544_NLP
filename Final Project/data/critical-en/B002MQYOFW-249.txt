The dystopian future YA novel is something I enjoy reading. This series was meh at best. I couldn't get behind Katniss and her lack of any real emotion towards either Peeta or Gale. Ever. She never shows any emotion towards either of these boys that supposedly love her. She doesn't even really want to free Panem from the cruel President Snow until she really has to. I was super excited to read this series after all the hype and I was left lukewarm towards it in general. Kinda like Katniss. And I hated how she ended up with who she did in the end. One guy just went away so she stayed with the other. Talk about settling. She was a weak heroine and far too wishy washy. The only time she ever showed any kind of emotion was when it came to her sister Prim or her own survival, which she even stops caring about in the end. Check it out from the library and see for yourself, but I'm not the hugest fan. I didn't hate them, I've read much worse, but they definitely weren't my favorite.
