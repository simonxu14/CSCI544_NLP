i was really looking forward to reading the hunger games books because i keep hearing how good they are,well i tried to download this book on my kindle and it wouldnt,it would only download what the chapters were but none of the literature was there,so i returned it,i called kindle support hoping to solve this issue,i tried to download it again,it would only show the book for a second but then when i went back to my home page on the kindle and tried to get back into the book again and i was having the same problem as the first time,the chapters where there but none of the story was...so once again i returned it,tried to download it again later,it still wouldnt work,so i bought 4 other different books by different authors and it downloaded just fine,so i dont know if there is just something wrong with the downloading process of that particular book or what but i wont be trying to buy it again anytime soon until they fix this problem...im sure this book is a great read,i was just having problems downloading it=-(
