Like the others who have given this trilogy a 3 star rating, I loved the first two books but was seriously disappointed in the last one. She obviously wanted to hurry up and get it over with. (spoiler alert) So many good characters that I grew to love in the second book were killed for no reason in the third. It's like she just didn't want to have to write more about them so she got rid of them in the easiest way she could think of. It's really too bad. There was a lot of promise in what it could have been, but her heart wasn't in it, so it naturally failed as a result for me. I would give the first book a 4 and the second one a 4.5. But the last book's gruesome and depressing end ruined my love for the whole trilogy, putting them at a 3 for me.
