The ebook was great.  My only problem was that I was charged twice for the same ebook and only got the one copy that was a gift for my daughter.  Not sure why the double charge but they don't seem to believe me that I only got it once and will not refund the extra charge.  I would probably not buy from Amazon ebooks again.
