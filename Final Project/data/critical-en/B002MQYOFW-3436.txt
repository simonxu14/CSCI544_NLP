If I could give these books 0 stars I would.  The plot line was disgusting and violent.  I would never in a million years let my adolescent children read it.  I am an adult and the themes gave me nightmares.  You leave these books feeling depressed and without hope.  Evil and violence win.  The main character goes crazy and is suicidal.  What is the author trying to teach children...that hope is a bad thing?  That love never overcomes obstacles?  That killing is ok and a form of entertainment?  I would rather burn these books then donate them to my library for some kid to read.
