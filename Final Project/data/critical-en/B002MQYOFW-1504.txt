Writers must never resort to a 'god from the machine' to solve issues with their plots. In Latin this is called deus ex machina, and refers to plays that use a god-like character lowered from a crane onto the stage to resolve a difficult problem by casting away the story's internal logic to solve said problem, thereby deflating all of the tension that the problem creates. It demonstrates a lack of creativity on the writer's part, and Suzanne Collins uses this weak technique no fewer than three times in this book. The first one seems almost completely intentional, because it is literally a booming voice from the sky, and it's at this moment where a good story becomes trite.<br /><br />Except even before this moment, the book has problems.<br /><br />I thought that I had seen the worst adverb use in dialogue attribution when my eyes happened upon "...I said frostily" in Stephanie Meyer's abysmally bad Twilight, but then I saw "This is it? I think grouchily", and I was astonished yet again at how something so awful could have been either written by an author or missed (or worse, suggested) by an editor. The Hunger Games is not as bad as Twilight, but there are times when it is difficult to take seriously. The writing is weak, it's careless, and as far as I'm concerned, it rips off the reader. Great writing is crafted and honed through multiple passes. Much of what lies on the page here is slipshod. We deserve better for the time we invest in your book. The STORY deserves better.<br /><br />It's fast paced, which keeps the pages turning despite its numerous problems, but at times the pace is so fast that it feels like some really great moments could have been made better by a more careful, lingering squeeze of the scenes.<br /><br />There is no good reason for this book to have been written in first person, present tense. This is a story that screams out to be written in third person, allowing for better development of all of the characters involved (not to mention the possibility that the protagonist might not survive).<br /><br />Subplots are created and then ultimately left flailing in the margins (what purpose do the muttations serve?). Why does Gale become such a non-character once the protagonist is taken away to fight? Here's an idea: What if he was so worried for her safety while watching the games, that he commits a crime to get the funds to get her a parachute drop of something she needed in the woods to survive? She could learn this when she got back, that he was ultimately caught and arrested (possibly executed) as a result. At least he's no longer an empty character.<br /><br />This book is ultimately a disappointment because so much of its potential is ruined. The promise The Hunger Games makes to be great in its first half is ultimately broken.
