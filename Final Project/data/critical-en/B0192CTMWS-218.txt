The story was excellent!  If you enjoyed the previous books in the series, this one will be loved as well.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in the copy I received from Amazon.  Approximately 10 pages were blank or printed so lightly they could not be read.  Every page of this story is filled with details, so in order not to miss them, I had to get an electronic copy of the book on my son's kindle fire.  Since the electronic copy did not come with page numbers, I had to search within the chapters to find the text that was missing from my copy of the book.  Very frustrating!  I planned to order the new book on Amazon, to be released this summer, but I'll wait until I can buy it locally.  No reason to waste my money on a copy of the book that cannot be fully enjoyed.
