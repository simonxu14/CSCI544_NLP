The product arrived late and was so damaged as to be partially destroyed. The tapes were very worn. Some of the titles on each cassette were worn off. The tapes had been repackaged in a soft vinyl packaging which was badly bent so that two cassettes were broken<br />and could not be played. The tapes that could be listened too were not rewound or only partially rewound.  I will not be purchasing from this vendor again. The product was misrepresented, only partially useable and not fun to listen to if it could be listened to at all.
