Compared to other dystopias, such as 1984, Animal Farm, Brave New World, Lord of the Flies, or Fahrenheit 451, The Hunger Games is mediocre at best. I saw the film first and was underwhelmed, so I read the book to see if that was an appropriate response on my part. The novel is only marginally better, providing more details and a deeper character study of the heroine, Katniss Everdeen. The other characters in the novel were sketchy, in my opinion, but I awarded two stars for the depiction of the tenacious Everdeen. As for her two love interests, there is insufficient chemistry to create interest on the part of the reader. The most interesting part of the novel for me was the preparation for the games. The games themselves were anticlimactic, lacking in suspense, and even ho-hum at times. The most egregious flaw in the novel is the depiction of the futuristic society--or should I say lack of depiction. It doesn't come alive for me and I can find little satirical intent other than a skewering of reality tv shows. There is evidence that the society has advanced technology, but as to the people who live in it or run it, they are amorphous to the point of almost lacking identity. In the final analysis, the novel seems to be nothing more than an excuse to set a group of teenagers at one another's throats, periodically throwing obstacles in their path.
