I really enjoyed the first two books in the trilogy and was eager to read this one. The first half was great but the plot slowly degenerated. It was as if the writer wasn't sure where to take the story. Fantastical creatures, an unrealistic mission and the resolution seems too sudden after three books. Too many questions left unanswered. Ms Collins lacks the control demonstrated in the first two novels. Perhaps she simply ran out of ideas. Read it if you must know Katniss' future - as I did - but be prepared to be enormously frustrated with the rest.
