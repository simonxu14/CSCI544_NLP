I chose this rating because it is more of a young adult type of novel.  I'm pretty old and jaded :))  I saw elements of &#34;The Lottery&#34; and many other post-apocalyptic story lines.  I do like that it does kind of have a message of social injustice and how societies should be structured.  I don't have much more to say about the book.
