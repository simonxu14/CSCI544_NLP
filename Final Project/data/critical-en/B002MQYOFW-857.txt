Well this book is proof that you cannot follow a really great book with a continuation of the story and have the same excitement as the first.  I found this book very slow moving and disjointed compared to the first 2 books in the series.  The characters were dim and weak.  It seemed that the author was just finding a way to end this book series and couldn't quite find the right path to take. The first 2 books had me reading all night to find out what happened but this last book took me 4 days to slog through it.  I almost put it away and thought about reading the Wikipedia explanation to find out what happened.  Wikipedia tells the story without the slogging in between.  My opinion only please don't roast me over this as I really liked The Hunger Games.
