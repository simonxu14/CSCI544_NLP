I ate up The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, so naturally i was eager to start on Mockingjay!  Well, BIG disappointment!!  It was all jumbled and thrown together and confusing at a few parts.  There were a couple pieces i had to reread to understand what was going on because everything was being thrown together without something to lead up to whatever was happening, like in the first two books!<br /><br />I could have been happy and content with JUST reading the Epilogue.  It was a total waste to read those 27 chapters!  I actually wasnt sure how i felt about the book, but then i got to Chapter 25 and that did it for me!  HATED IT!!
