This book was definitely not as good as the first two for me. I felt that it dragged in a lot of places and that some of the characters didn't seem as true to form as the other two books. Katniss seemed to go from strong female lead to a snivelling cry baby that hid from everything and kept needing to be saved until the very end. It was overall okay but a dissappointment in reference to the fisrt two books. It's a good read but not great.
