The first two books were so good but the third was so disappointing.  I feel like I wasted my time and the trilogy seems to incomplete.  I think the third book was so rushed when written, there are parts that jump around or important people are killed off with little explanation or in an unrealistic way.  Katniss seemed so strong in the first two books but in this one she was nothing more than a selfish whiner.  All I wanted was to get to the end so I'd know what happened at the end of all of this ... and even that was a disappointment.
