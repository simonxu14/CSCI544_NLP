After all those positive reviews concerning Susan Collins's series I was really eager to read her books. I'm not disappointed - these books really ARE interesting but there is not much more to them. The final book of the trilogy did not stand out from the other two.Overall, it was a well spent time. I guess teenagers, for whom the books were primarily written will appreciate them more.
