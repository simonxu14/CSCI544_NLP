I won't give out any spoilers, but this book was such a disappointment. The first of the series was amazing, the second was good, but this one really sent The Hunger Games series into a downward spiral. I don't think I cried this much since all of the deaths in Harry Potter! Just read the first book and assume they all live happily ever after.
