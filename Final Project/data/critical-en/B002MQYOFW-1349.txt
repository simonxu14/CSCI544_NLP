I've read these books because I wanted to read them before I saw the movie. The first book of the trilogy is my favourite. The other two, not so much. They are the natural continuance of the first one, but they are very political for my taste. The love triangle and relationships between Katniss, Peeta and Gale are way too complicated for adolescents. By the end of the trilogy, they are too psychologically damaged to feel like functional human beings and to allow us readers to relate to them.<br />On the other hand, the possibility to purchase all three books at once is very comfortable for Kindle owners. I hope you guys at Amazon come up with more books series to buy all-at-once.
