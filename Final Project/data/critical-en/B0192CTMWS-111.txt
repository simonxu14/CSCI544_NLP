Pre-ordered the book and was waiting in anticipation. What a let down!<br />It seems like JKR has written a book for the sake of it and nothing more. There is no coherent plot. Before I read the book, I was pretty sure I'd cry at the death of whoever it was that died, but honestly after reading it, there is only indifference. OKay, so she HAD to kill someone and the pages were running out. So, Sirius, off you go. The HP charecters did look one dimensional so far. By trying to develop a darker side to each personality, she still has not managed to convey depth.<br />Why does fudge suddenly show up and start believing?<br />Totally lame.
