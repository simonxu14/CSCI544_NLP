I had considered this book in the past and rejected it, but when all the hullabaloo came out about the movie I figured I'd go ahead and read it. This book will never be confused with great literature, but then I don't believe that is it's intent. I enjoyed reading it, but did feel it lacked substance. It was, simply put, just entertainment, no underlying "meaning" to it. When I think about the book after having read it, it's characters were underdeveloped and not really believable. The premise of the book, a future world where children are chosen to fight to the death, is unbelievable if you really think about it.<br />However, the bottom line is that I read it quickly and was entertained. I may get the sequels, but I'm in no rush for them.
