Loved the first two books, in which the character development and treatment were excellent. Mockingjay created characters and disposed of them with nary a care to the reader impact. I could go on and on about this, but scores of other reviewers already have. This has nothing to do with the major shift in gears to make social or philosophical points, or to depress with the fact that war is indeed hell, that good and evil, right and wrong often present difficult, and ambiguous choices. My problem is that you do not need to rush through the book, obliterate caring about characters, and write patently absurd, quickly scribbled, battle scenes in the pursuit of making a statement. This book could have easily joined the first two as a wonderful part of a continuing saga if the author, for whatever reason, did not abandon what she started and write as if she were under a newspaper deadline.
