I really got into the series when book 3 came out and I LOVED them! I thought J. K. Rowling did an excellent job of taking ordinary ideas and twisting them into wonderful works of fiction. But in the years that I waited for 4 and 5 to come out, I've read a lot of books that have stood the test of time, and I am beginning to realize just how much Rowling has borrowed from other works.  I still really enjoyed book 4 but book 5 seemed uninspired.<br />I felt the tone of the author was much different than in the previous books. The character development was weak and too predictable. It seemed that the author was rushing even though the book itself was dragging along painfully slow.  This book seemed more like a draft that needed to be worked with to get the story to crystallize into a well-crafted and clearly thought out story. The quality of the writing was certainly not what I have come to expect from Rowling.<br />I hope Rowling has not exhausted her supply of tales she has been drawing on to create this series.  I also hope that becoming a multimillionaire, writing screenplays, marriage, and adding to her family will not distract her from finishing this series with 2 superb books.  If book 6 is as bad as 5 was, I may not read book 7 - even though I was a rabid fan not that long ago.
