Having just completed the entire series in less then 3 days you could easily say I was fascinated with the books. I couldn't hardly put them down and was drawn into the plot. That is until the third book.<br /><br />When I started the first book I said to myself, finally a strong heroine thats not too stupid to live or incapable of taking care of herself. Her inital strength and resiliancy even in the face of all the opression and hardship was uplifting. Katniss was less then perfect which made it even better, I envisioned her growing and becoming the face of the revolution, just not the mouth piece puppet for it.<br /><br />Without going into much detail as to not ruin the whole book (which really if you have stuck with the series up to this point you had just as well see it through)I found the book a bit of an anti climax. I understand what Katniss went through would haunt her, it would change her in alot of ways. The one thing I didn't expect was her almost recession from being a strong willed survivor to a fragile, cowering (at times), shell of the warrior she once was. I was fighting for her to become the woman that would lead and not just act for the revolution. She spent far too much of her time hiding away from everyone and everything, allowing herself to be used by so many people and in my opinion, becoming a literal "Mockingjay". She was nothing more then a well trained bird parroting what she was told. Now don't get me wrong, she did break through so of that, just not to the extent her first character showed promise for in the previous books.<br /><br />I was left with a bad taste with the way Katniss' and Gale's relationship ended, there was no closure there for me. For me, it just seemed cold and unfinished in so many ways. I knew who she would end up with pretty early on but I expected more from the final goodbye as well as when she obviously made her choice. Endings are a big thing for me in a book (as I am sure it is for most readers), no matter how poorly a book starts or if it faulters in the plotline, it needs a strong ending that gives me closure on issues and this one just left too many open sores.<br /><br />I loved the first book, liked the second, tolerated the third.
