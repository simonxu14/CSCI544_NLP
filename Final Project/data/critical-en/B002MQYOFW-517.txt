I knew early on in this book that I would always think of the first one as the best. However I couldn't find many reasons to like this one at all. The two biggest scenes are cut short and confusing to the point that there is no true climax in this book. The author missed a great opportunity to save this book and series but punted and ended it leaving us all feeling unfulfilled. I give it two stars because it is worth reading if you are invested in the series, but the writing is choppy, confusing, and void of the true suspense that could have been.
