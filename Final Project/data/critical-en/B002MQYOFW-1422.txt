I was SO excited to get Mockingjay. I had been wait for about nine months. When I first got it, although I was very excited, it was actually hard to get into, very unlike the other two. Katniss didn't seem like her real self. Although this would have been a bit much, because the 1st and 2nd books feature this, I actually missed the arena's suspense and exhilaration. It seemed like the book was blah for 2/3 of it and finally got ok at the end. I really wish this would have been better because I love Suzanne Collins but she just didn't come through on this. I have to give her credit though, it's hard to follow an act when the first two books were such great sellers. All in all, disappointing but at least we know what happens.<br />Corinne - 13
