First, let me explain that I was not looking for a fairy tale with a "happy-ever-after" ending as some have suggested to other reviewers. And I found the way the story ended quite good, I felt it fit with what happened in the story, mostly.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the first two books but was very let down by this one. We waited a long time for any action to occur with most of the book feeling simply grey with no color, good or bad. Some of the charactors pretty much flat lined and lost any interest that was generated in the first two books.<br /><br />I felt the story ending was good and brought home the way war changes people and that once those changes occur life goes on, but it's never the same. My problem with the ending was the way it was presented. The action had finally picked up but then suddenly Katniss was pretty much in a coma (or her own personal brain fog) for the last chapters and we only got the rest of the story after the fact in a quick synopsis of "this is what happened while you were out of it." When authors do this, and it happens too often, I always feel like they suddenly realized the book might be getting too long and so they tried to wrap up all the loose ends in a neat little package in as few words as possible. Show me the trial and the uproar that occurred as a result of her actions.<br /><br />I agree with some about the way the two men in her life ended up. I don't think she would have lost all interest in the one she didn't end up with or that he would step completely out of her life, either. They shared the war as comrades just as much as she did with the one she ended up with (sorry, a little cryptic, but I don't want to spoil the ending), just in different ways.<br /><br />I'd still recommend reading it just to wrap up the story, but don't expect the same exciting "I can't put it down" feeling that the first two invoked.
