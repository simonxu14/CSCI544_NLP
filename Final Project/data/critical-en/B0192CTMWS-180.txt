I love Harry Potter and wanted a replacement for my battered second hand hardback copy of "Order of the Phoenix".  I was really disappointed in the quality of this book and no jacket cover.  It's much smaller than the one I own.  This book has a hard cover but the quality of paper is equal to that of a paper back book.  So if you want a quality hard back Harry Potter book, this isn't it.  If you just want the book to read but not save, then save yourself some money and order a paperback copy.
