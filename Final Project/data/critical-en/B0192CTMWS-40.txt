Well, I wrote a review some years ago, when I first read this book. Same number of stars.<br /><br />My opinion hasn't changed much, but I deleted my original review. Why? Y'all can't handle a dissenting viewpoint. The second someone pipes up with &#34;I identified with Draco and wished Rowling had given him a halfway happy ending,&#34; you guys jump down their throat and downvote every defense they offer.<br /><br />You don't want a discussion. You want an echo chamber.<br /><br />I'm leaving that here. Peace and out.
