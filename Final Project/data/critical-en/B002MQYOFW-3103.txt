I'll keep this short.  I've spent the last few days re-reading the entire series.  But while I've read HG and CF probably 5-6 times each, I find it a struggle to read MJ for the third time.  I just can't get as swept away in the story as with the first two books.<br /><br />SPOILERS *** SPOILERS *** SPOILERS *** SPOILERS *** SPOILERS *** SPOILERS *** SPOILERS ***<br /><br />This could be due to many reasons:<br />* didn't like that Katniss's story wasn't followed for most of the story<br />* didn't like how Gale turned out to be cold, even if it makes sense for his character<br />* didn't like that there weren't as many truly moving passages (I loved Rue's death scene, the song, the rope song; I lose count of how many times I wiped away tears in the first two books)<br />* Katniss ending up with Peeta made sense, but the conclusion with Gale wasn't satisfying<br /><br />But really, I think the main problem was that I never got as emotionally invested in the third book as I did with the first two. It just didn't pull me in.  I just didn't care so much; and when I finished the book for the first time, I was simply disappointed, which says a lot given how much I loved the first two.  FWIW, I rarely reread books.
