I don't have much to say except that it was very disappointing. She had a great story going and totally messed it up with book three. It's as if she ran out of creativity and just wanted to fill the pages to get a paycheck. I am sorry I paid for the book and even more sorry I wasted time reading it. It was better when I had imagined my own ending.
