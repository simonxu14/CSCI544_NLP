first was fascinating a great idea kept you on the edge. Secound was interesting and not as expected but the third was boring like any trilogy writer struggles and over do the story and forget the message or the purpose of the whole story .Still one starts reading book one and wants to keep on reading and then struggles to forget it. Not a great read but okay.
