This book ruined the series for me - I had to drag my way through it.  The author didn't maintain the integrity of her characters, the pace was dreadful, and the ending abrupt.  I loved, loved the first one - so sad that this one left such a bad taste in my mouth.  I will have trouble recommending the series to anyone because of it.
