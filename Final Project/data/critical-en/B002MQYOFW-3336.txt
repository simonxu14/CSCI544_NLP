Yet another book that I decided to read because of the Hype surrounding it. Really people!? Really?!<br /><br />I cannot believe the hype surrounding this book.  It was very predictable I honestly knew everything that was going to happen. Anytime something went wrong, bam! There was something to fix it. Everything, just like that, fell into place.<br /><br />I will say that if I were a 9 year old child I would probably give this book a 4 star review but being 22 this book was such an easy read and makes me wonder why there are adults acting like it was such a good book. It has a Twilight feel to it.<br /><br />I'm not writing a deep review on this book and I won't be reading the rest.
