The long-awaited fifth novel in the Harry Potter series hit stores recently to much hype but what is the truth about this novel?  My question is, did JK Rowling really write this novel and if so, did she simply forget the previous four?<br />The basic grammer is, in places, atrocious and leaves one to question if the novel has been edited but the most annoyingly evident fact that leads one to believe the story was pushed through without thought is the change in characters.  First, Harry Potter has become spoiled and can, in the beginning, be compared to what Draco Malfoy must have been like at an earlier age.  Lord Voldemort who, in the first four novels was know as He Who Must Not Be Named has mysteriously become You Know Who with the supporting characters showing more fear at his name in this novel than all the previous ones combined.<br />Personally, I feel as if I paid for a brand name and got generic. I can only hope her next book, if indeed there is one, after waiting three years for a book that was supposed to come out in one year, it is reasonable to wonder if I will see it in my lifetime, will be better than this one.
