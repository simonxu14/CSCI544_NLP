I believe this book was intended for much younger readers.  I do not like the violence and the story line.  I wonder what this generation is coming to.  considering my age I would not recomment this for most readers.  just don't "get it". I would not purchase the other two books in this series.  I talked to my grandson so I know the ending BUT.......just not to my liking!!
