I loved the hunger games trilogy, however I felt let down at the end of Mockingjay simply because I wanted more from Gale's character. You cannot tell me that Gale, someone who loved Katniss through all of the books, would just up and desert her to live in district two. His character seemed to just vanish into thin air for me. I loved Gale and followed him throughout the whole series and the let down would be less great if there were a fourth book in the series to explain all of the loose ends. Peeta doesn't have to win her over, nor does Gale; they both just seem to stop caring and Katniss just ends up with the one who follows her to 12. This book was VERY disappointing to me largely because I felt the other two books far exceeded this one in plot, character relationships, and most importantly the reader consciousness of the story. Half the time I couldn't follow what was happening because the story would just drop off and would be explained later, but then somethings were never explained! I ended the Trilogy with many questions that will never be answered. I hope that Mrs. Collins decides to write another book to this series I think it will help the reader's understanding IMMENSELY! Lovely books though. Enjoyed the adventurous read!
