Obviously, Harry Potter is amazing. However, if you're looking for a collectible , don't waste your money with this cheaply made knock off. I bought the original at Barnes and Noble, and it looked perfect. This version, however, was no where near that. The paper book sleeve was off from how it should be on the actual book, and the texture of the gold embossing of the title was completely cheap. The colors were more faded than the original, and the corners of the book were bent in. This is good if you're looking for a cheap version just to read, but not for a collectible. Spend the extra $15 and get it from B&N.<br /><br />Also, notice in my pictures how the legit version says $26.99 and the cheal one says $19.99. The jacket art credit is also missing from the bottom of the cheap version.<br /><br />The legit version from B&N is on the right in my pictures, the one from this site is on the left.
