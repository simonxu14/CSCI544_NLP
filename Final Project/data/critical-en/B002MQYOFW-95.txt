I'm nothing like an expert - or even really slightly knowledgeable - in the YA area, but this trilogy seems reasonably good to me. Collins poses some important questions, like how do we handle the power new technologies permit? What does it mean to be a human being? How do we establish values? Does the past have something to offer contemporary sensibilities? And here's one I really like concerning a governing theme in the third volume, Real/Not Real, related to Hungry/Fed: How do we avoid creating a society wherein a small elite (unreal/fed) is sustained by the (real/hungry) forced labor of the majority? She also asks young readers to query the notions of love and friendship, responsibility and guilt.<br /><br />The three-star rating, as opposed to four or five, has to do with writing/literary merit. Collins's language is not memorable. However, there are good nutshell aphorisms that may help young readers/future leaders access concepts quickly, especially with regard to management of power, for example: 'If we burn, you burn with us.'<br /><br />Other objections include the substitution of escalating violence for real tension - there's so much of it it becomes wallpaper - and a video-game trope for how violence is carried out. I know using video game machinations - it's right there in the title - helps Collins reach her primary audience. For that audience, it's relevant. But for me, it's too easy, cheap, and the army of bad guys to be killed off too much a poverty of dimension, even granting the concept of cyber-infinity, and the perils and paradoxes involved in entering it.<br /><br />I like the convenience of the boxed paperback set, and am glad i chose to purchase this particular edition.
