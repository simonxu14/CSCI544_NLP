I have to admit that I am still slogging through this book and I'm not sure if I'm going to finish it.  I felt like the first book started out so strong and then things started really going downhill when we hit this book.  It's very slow paced and the environs of the underground world are very sterile and boring.  I personally haven't spoken to one person who has liked this book.  I'm told that the later portion of the book is where the reader hits pay dirt.  Even so, they tell me that the ending is kind of disappointing.<br /><br />If I finish it, I will edit the review.  However, I felt there was some relevance in reporting the fact that it's such a chore to read and that's why I'm reviewing at this time.<br /><br />I'm a teacher, and my students tell me that I just have to stay the coarse to the end and then things get better.  That's not exactly the kind of endorsement that inspires me.
