Don't read this book - It is a literally a waste of your time.. So depressing and at the end the writer leaves so many loose ends that you cannot even comprehend what is going on.<br /><br />Painful to read as my expectation of this book was a little more that what we got. If you really want to read it don't get to fixed into details because they wont be closed or related at the end.
