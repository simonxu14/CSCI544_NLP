Bought it because I thought my friend was going to &#34;make&#34; me see the movie and I wanted to compare...still haven't seen the movie...and I don't think i'm upset about it. Book 1 is by far the best of the three. If you only want to know what all the hype is about I would suggest just getting that and leaving the other two out of it.
