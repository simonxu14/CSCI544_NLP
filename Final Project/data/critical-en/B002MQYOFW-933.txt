First off let me state without reservation that Suzanne Collins is an amazing author. Mockingjay is a well-written, fast paced thriller. It’s the plot that I actually disliked. I can’t give much detail because if I did, I would have to issue a spoiler alert. I think Collins is a victim of her own talents. In books one and two, I became so attached to the characters, I was really looking for a more positive path for some of the characters I grew to love. I can’t see how they will be able to make this one into a movie without some major changes. There must be a dozen different outcomes that would have been better than the disappointing path the author chose.
