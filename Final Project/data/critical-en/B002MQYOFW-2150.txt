I was glued to my kindle for the first two in the series. The third book starts off a little slower, but was a good read. Was disappointed with the last book as it appeared the author took bad advice from the publisher to get the book out. Appeared rushed at the last third of book and then there was an odd twists that didn't fit the flow of the book. I would read other books from the author.
