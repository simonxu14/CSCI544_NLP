There are just too many problems with this writing. Collins can tell a story and make it suspenseful, but it seems at least one-third the book is devoted to reminiscing and recalling scenes from the first two novels. Then there are scenes where Katniss can't express how she's feeling. As an author it's Collins job to do that. It doesn't have to be eloquent or universal, but you can't rely on cheap workarounds by saying, &#34;Peeta would know how to say it&#34;. It's nice to conclude the narrative, but the writing just isn't great.
