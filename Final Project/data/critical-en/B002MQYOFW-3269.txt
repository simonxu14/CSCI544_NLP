Suzanne Collin's flippant application of gore, violence, and senseless death is an affront to humanity.  This series is like watching someone trapped in a burning car wreckage.  You wish there was something you could do to put a stop to it, but at the same time you can't look away.  It leaves you feeling sick inside.<br /><br />The cover on this book is light blue with what looks like a dove on it.  This symbol of peace belies the brutality within.  I literally tore this hardcover book to shreds when i was finished with it.  If you've read the first two and are considering buying this to get closure, don't.  There is no redemption for the horrors it contains.  The ending is dissatisfying beyond belief. Please spare yourself the pain and don't get attached to this series.  If you have already bought a copy, please dispose of it.
