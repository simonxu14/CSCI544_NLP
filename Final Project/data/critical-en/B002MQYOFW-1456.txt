I have to say that I did not like these books as much as I thought I would. I had read so many good reviews and expected a rich complex story. I thought the concept was great and even original (??). However the story was not well developed. I found the story to be too simple, predictable, clich&eacute;, and unreasonably heroic for my taste. Even the supposedly dark moments in the book were not described well enough to be felt dark or disturbing. This not to discourage anyone to read these books. Many people have read and truly enjoyed these stories. YOu may be one of them which is great.
