Bad! It's all bleak and nothing really happens. I couldn't continue this book, Katniss is now annoying and I can't make sense of why the survivors are living like they are, they are basically like the villains in the capital I don't want them to win their revolution and I can't believe that KAtniss is going to change things or become a valid political leader.  Bad
