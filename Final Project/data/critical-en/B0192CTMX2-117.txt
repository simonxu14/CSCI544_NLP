I've read all the books, and enjoyed the first four a great deal. However the last three have left me feeling flat. So many questions are left unanswered, the plot plods along, and none of the characters seems to undergo any real development.<br /><br />It ends the series reasonably well, but there are no real fireworks in my opinion. It was a solidly okay book, but no more than that.
