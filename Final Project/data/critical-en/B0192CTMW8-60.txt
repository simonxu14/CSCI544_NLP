Very disappointing.  This looks nothing like the original hardback book.  I have the original paperback and was hoping to obtain a hardback version so my son could have the collection. This book is not only child size but cheeply made with thin paper. It is of no use to me and will propably through it in the trash. Words cannot explain how disappointed we are.
