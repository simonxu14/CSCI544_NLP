Mockingjay, the final book of The Hunger Games Trilogy, was again, one that I read in one setting. I had so thoroughly enjoyed the first two books that I had really high expectations for the finale. Unfortunately, I was not as thrilled with the final book. I liked the plot line for the most part. I felt let down by the main character Katniss. Through the first two books, Katniss had really been angry with her mother for how she got depressed following the death of Katniss's father. However, in this book, Katniss seems to follow in her mother's footsteps and just didn't seem to have the same qualities that had seemed to be portrayed throughout the first two books. Still, as this is the end of the trilogy, it is an essential read to finish the series, still I was disappointed.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the trilogy and I am a new Suzanne Collins fan. As with the other two books, I would give this a PG-13 rating due to the descriptions of the battle scenes.<br /><br />Kristi Burchfiel, author of applicable Bible Studies and devotionals
