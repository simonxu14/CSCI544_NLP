This is the first time that I'm reviewing a book that already has over 13,000 reviews; though I doubt that anyone will ever read this, writing is how I decide what I feel about a book. It has been a while since I read the 2nd book in the Hunger Games trilogy, and perhaps I had forgotten how gruesome the themes can be.<br /><br />This book dwells in the dark and foreboding aspects of the competitions and wars between the districts. Katniss is drugged, injured and depressed for most of the book. She is forced to think about and perhaps choose between the two men in her life - Gale, her childhood friend, who taught her to hunt and has been so supportive; and Peeta, who she partnered with during the first games she participated in. Their every move was recorded, watched and orchestrated by the administrators of the Games.<br /><br />All of the odd, yet familiar characters from the previous 2 books appear here, but their characters are not really expanded upon. A feeling of dread builds throughout the book, and the climax is more devastating than I could have imagined. I couldn't stop reading, always hoping that the next chapter would reveal an upturn in the prospects for Katniss, Peeta and Gale. The ending was not what I expected, and it almost seems as if the author has set us up for a sequel. We shall see....
