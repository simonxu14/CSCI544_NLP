This book might as well have been written by a TOTALLY different person than the first two. The story takes a few crazy turns, the characters COMPLETELY fall apart and show no signs of themselves as we've grown to know them, and the last few pages just stop. There's no GOOD conclusion and the Epilogue is used to wrap up the entire series in a few measley paragraphs!<br /><br />I spent every waking minute of the past week reading through the Hunger Games trilogy only to be severely underwhelmed. I just feel bad for all those people who had to wait for this book to come out. Luckily, I read all three at once and don't have to deal with the agony of impatience met with the total feeling of disappointment.
