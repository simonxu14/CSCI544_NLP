If you've read the first two books (which are very good), then you sort of have to read this one as well.  I'm sure that most readers would also feel that they know what to expect after reading the first two books.  Unfortunately, that isn't the case.  This book has a completely different feel from the others.  It's depressing, honestly.<br /><br />I'll try to be vague enough to avoid any SPOILERS for those that want to read this book.  One of main characters in the story seems to spend half the book sedated.  Another character, due to a plot twist, is completely "out of character" for the entire book.  How was that supposed to work?  Collins takes a character that she's spent the last two books making us care about, and then strips that character of all those traits.  Bravo!<br /><br />Another issue I have is that these books were introduced to me by my 10 year old son.  These books are very popular at his elementary school library.  There is no reason for 10 year olds to be reading these books!  They are extremely violent (especially this last book), the characters are dark and moody, and a great deal of the subtext is probably beyond their scope at that age.  I'd think twice before letting my kids get caught up in this trilogy.
