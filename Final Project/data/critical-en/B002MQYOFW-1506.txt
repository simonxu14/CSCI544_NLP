I loved the first two books, so when I picked up this one I expected to love it as well... I was sorely mistaken.<br /><br />WARNING SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />The book started out ok, with Katniss understandably trying to get over what happened in the Hunger Games, but I expected her character to grow.  With all that she's been though, you would expect her to grow stronger and maybe even start becoming a leader against the Capital, but instead she spends the entire time hiding in corners and passing out!  And she goes from being used by the Capital, to being used be the rebellion!  She never becomes her own person!<br /><br />Also, The way she treats Peeta is unforgivable!  It's almost like the moment he stopped giving her affection and adoring her, she abandoned him!  If she truly loved him, she would have tried harder to help him; instead she considered, more then once, to just kill him!  It showed how selfish her character was and I grew to despise her!  Even in the end it just looked like she settled for Peeta because Gale was no longer in the picture!<br /><br />And what happened to characters like Haymitch??  In the previous two books, even when he was drunk, he was there for Katniss and offered her sound advise.  In this book he's just another face in the crowd.  What happened to his attitude and his humor?<br /><br />Another thing that upset me was that when Katniss was on her mission to kill Snow, she didn't make it!  All those characters that died so that she could get to him and kill him, died in vain!  One minute she's about to reach Snow's house and the next she's passed out in district 13.  I found myself very confused and disappointed.  And I again was very disappointed in her character development when she voted to have another Hunger Games with the Capital's children.<br /><br />All in all it was a bad ending to a great story.  I was very disappointed with this one.
