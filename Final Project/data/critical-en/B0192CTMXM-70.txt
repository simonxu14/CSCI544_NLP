The universal opinion I'd heard before reading this was that it was good, but had a more serious feel and was too long. Now that I've read it, I agree. I'm glad I read it and I'll certainly finish the series simply to find out how it ends (I'm not 100% sure about a happy ending after this read) but I won't reread as with the others. I could go into pages of specifics, but the truth is I simply didn't feel good during long parts of the book or after I finished it. 200 pages shorter, and I might've felt differently.
