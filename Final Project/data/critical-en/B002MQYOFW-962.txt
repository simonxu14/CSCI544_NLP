Writing a book review is hard without giving away any of the storyline. I'll just say the final book in the trilogy did not pan out the way I thought it would. It was so depressing and there were way too many "blackout" periods where Katniss would be unconscious and when she woke up the reader needed to caught up with everything that happenened. Prior to this trilogy I haven't read anything else Suzanne Collins has written so it may be similar to her prior work; however if you are like me I wouldn't waste your time. Just read how it ends on online somewhere or ask someone you know whose read it.
