I love this story, but the translation is not good. Several passages were changed from the English language version. The cause of a tantrum was alterted from a lack of ice cream to a too-small sandwich. A pet toad was changed to a tortoise/turtle. There were several other liberties taken in addition.<br />This is a good book, but a poor translation.
