I will first confess that I did not read the first two books, only saw the films. After seeing the second one I was left hanging so badly I immediately purchased the kindle version through amazon and spent the next 10 hours doing nothing but reading the book. I just had to find out what conclusions the author brought to it all - Peeta, Gale, Snow, Haymitch, Finnick, Katniss, all of them really. I was in the Peeta corner at the end of Catching Fire. I was hoping Collins would make him more manly but keep the same kindness and selflessness he seemed to possess in the two films. You know, the way she caused Katniss to go from teen heroine to complete basket case by this last book. I hated the fact that she turned him crazy... I was so disappointed that I spent 10 hours reading the most hopeless drivel, that I could have handled if there had been a decent ending.<br /><br />Upon reaching the end of chapter 26 my heart fell as I realized there was only one chapter left to tie everything together and give me some sort of conclusion to make me walk away at least fulfilled, but I resigned that there was too much left untold to be able to do that.<br /><br />What a cop-out to the story. It's almost like the author got tired of writing and had nothing left to give to the story except some very gruesome battle scenes that I'm not sure can make the cut in the film version. What a horrible, stupid, ungratifying ending!! To think it can all be summed up with a half chapter and a 4 paragraph epilogue?? And to turn Katniss from this amazingly strong character in the beginning to this selfish, I don't care about anyone but myself crying baby was so entirely wrong and fake to the story line. She could have at least written her to be happy about being with Peeta. Haymitch was right in catching fire to say she didn't deserve Peeta. She doesn't deserve Gale, either. I wanted her to end up a better character than that. To actually deserve one of them, not just wind up with who was left standing!! Infuriating!<br /><br />And to the people who say this is what war is like, forget the love stories and supporting stories and deal with it, we don't read FICTION novels to learn about real life!!! If I want to know the horrors of war I'll read about it in a non-fiction way.<br /><br />I am dreaming of a complete re-write to this story or at the very least hoping for the first time the movie will NOT be true to the book!
