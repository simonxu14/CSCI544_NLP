The hardcover set packaging is not of the highest quality, but I did not expect it to be, the bindings are also not of the quality of other youth books like Harry Potter, but they should stand up to a number of readings if you so desire. These books are very easy reads, be it the font size, the simple wording, or the relatively simple plot, most readers will be able to make it through the series with relative ease. This review may contain spoilers.<br /><br />The first book in the series, The Hunger Games, is well crafted, It is far and away the best book in the series. It is a story of a dystopian world in which a girl who in an effort to save her little sister is pitted against seemingly horrific odds in a gladiator style battle to the death. The choices she must make help define her humanity. As the book progresses there are mushy moments, which make it clear that this book is primarily aimed at teen girls. I would give it 4/5 stars, because it does not have the universal appeal of many youth books.<br /><br />The second book in the series, Catching Fire, while not as fluid as the second book deals more with the  consequences of defying government in the dystopia that was unveiled in the first book. I felt like this book was more of an effort to extend the success of the first book, and perhaps not truly necessary. This book has some interesting concepts such as a clever arena in which the tributes must fight, but ultimately it fails to feel like more than a sequel. Once again this book delves into relationships and thus loses some appeal for most male readers. I give this book 3/5 stars, as this book brushes over the complex issues that arise in gladiator type battle and still fails to appeal to more than half of the population.<br /><br />The third book, Mockingjay, is in my opinion the worst book in the series. This book focuses on social revolution led by Catniss' actions in the previous books. this book ends melancholically at best and is really depressing. the entire reason for the sacrifice the main protagonist made in the first book is rendered moot, as is the revolution since the power hungry, government is replaced by one with equally sinister means of obtaining power. This book hardly falls into the happily ever after, and leaves the reader frustrated more than satisfied. I give this book 2/5 stars, because the ending makes the entire series feel as though it was all for naught.<br /><br />When averaged my reviews of these books work out to be 3/5. While the series is worth reading, it is not for everyone, and is not light hearted.
