I bought this to find out what the buzz was about this book.  I still have to wonder.  I found the writing style to be uneven, particularly in the beginning.  The tenses shifting made much of the first book quite hard for me to take in.  Generally if I read a first person account I expect it to be either in the present tense, or the past tense, but here the two tenses were alternated while still remaining within one time frame.<br />  As it progressed some of the tense usage got better and the writing a little more even, but I found it generally difficult to empathize with some of the characters by the end of the story.  I won't put in spoilers for those who actually want to read the book, but I wasn't surprised by one big &#34;shock&#34; event.  I also had no real emotional attachment by that point.
