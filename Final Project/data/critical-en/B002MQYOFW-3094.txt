I saw that the novel would be made into a movie and a co-worker said he enjoyed it so I bought it for my kindle.<br /> In fairness it is promoted as a teen novel, maybe I just need more.<br /> The premise was solid and for me novels written in the 1st person are always tricky. I felt the storyline (relationship) between Peeta and Kantiss was odd at best.<br /> Its a quick read and I don't regret reading it but as for now I don't think I'll be reading 2 or 3. Just not my cup of tea.
