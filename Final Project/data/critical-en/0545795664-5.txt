The book itself is awesome and my Pokemon loving kids have really enjoyed going through it, but pages started falling out the day after we received it. After that it seemed to be a waterfall effect. Now the first 30 pages of the book are tucked loose in the front and some have been lost. I wish they would make a hardcover version!<br /><br />Also of note is the book is alphabetized so if you don't know the name if the pokemon character get ready to start flipping through pages.
