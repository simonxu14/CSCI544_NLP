With such a bizzare story line, there could be no real happy ending here.  The &#34;conclusion&#34;  of the story didn't stand a chance of being casual reading.  The author provided a what-happens-next ride filled with horror and sadness, with a so-called ending that suited the world around it.  I was glad when it was over.
