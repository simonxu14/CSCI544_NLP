The first person present point of view made for a compelling first book, fast paced and immediate. By the second and third books however, the thread unravelled, as if the author didn't have a resolution in mind.  Also, in the end, I did not care for the main character! The protagonist does not seem to learn much about herself and is in denial about cruelty and injustice, love and humanity. A strange and deranged  heroine.  This trilogy feels like a single good book stretched into three for the sake of a sales package.
