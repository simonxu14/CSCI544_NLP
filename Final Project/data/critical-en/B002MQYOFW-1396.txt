I have to say I was really disappointed in Katniss.  So much for realizing what Gale was ranting about when they'd hunt in the woods.  So much for understanding what Peeta said on the rooftop about "dying as himself". She let herself by played by District 13 just as much as she was played by the Capitol.  I'm glad I finished the series, but I really did think that it would end differently.  Rather than becoming the Mockingjay, she let herself be pushed and pulled by circumstance and other individuals' agendas.  Katniss never became the individual she strived to be in that first book, and I have to admit, it was dissapointing.<br /><br />That being said -- I'm glad I finished the series.  What's a hero, if not flawed and not necessarily doing what I think they should?!  Welcome to real life, right?<br /><br />I like the message of the series, but I think the mark was missed in the end.
