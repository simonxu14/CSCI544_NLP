I have been looking at the reviews of Mockingjay by Suzanne Collins. So many others seem to share the same opinion on the ending. One even says he wishes he could re-write the end himself - wish I'm tempted to do. Closure. That's what I need. You can't write a Trilogy and end it like that. The whole book more of droned on, I kept reading - hoping for something different, a change in plot...something interesting. Collins left me hanging. She killed Finnick in a sentence, as well as many others, who played heartwarming roles, as well as humorous. Why kill off characters, as if you were picking berries from a bush? Collins picked one too many berries. And we were left with a bush - with only two real berries left. Katniss and Peeta. And even then - they were bland, boring berries at the ending.  Although she may have wrote Mockingjay a bit more realistic - realistic is not the material captivating readers wanted. We wanted adventure, we THRIVE on the adventure, and love triangle. A ending - a clean ending. And Closure. This was not closure.
