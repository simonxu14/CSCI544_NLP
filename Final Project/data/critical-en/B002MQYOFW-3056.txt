I bought this book and read it just to see what the hype was all about... doing so lessened my faith in humanity somewhat.<br /><br />It's not a good book.  It is written in a witty and modern style that moves super quickly, kinda like the TV Commercial version of a novel.  I hope this isn't the future of writing...<br /><br />Yes, it had me turning the pages really quick, and could be hard to put down at times.  The author does a lot of technical things very right.<br /><br />But at the end of the day, the main character is annoying at best and simply not believable at worst.  And not just the the main character, but most every character behaved in a way that just didn't seem believable.  They behaved in a way that advanced the plot very well, but not how you'd expect real people to behave.  I grew to dislike almost every character because of it.  And I also found myself shaking my head and facepalming throughout.<br /><br />(and yes, I know it's for a younger audience, but so was Harry Potter and many other excellent books... that's no excuse)
