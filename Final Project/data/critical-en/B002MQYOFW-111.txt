There are some books that jump off the shelf because their creativity is an easy disguise for a sign of the times. When my wife first suggested the Hunger Games, I thought it was too overtly brutal to become popular. Boy was I wrong. However, the reason it is becoming the next pop-culture book and movie series appears to come from our sense of connection to the plight of the characters. That should lead us to ask: Are we as Americans so desperate in our current recession that we can identify with the Hunger Games? As I read the first book, the link became clear. I could feel the pain of Katniss. She exists in a world where the few have everything and the many suffer in silence. While our current situation as a country is nowhere near the desperate times experienced during the great depression, there are a lot of people suffering in silence.<br /><br />I watched the movie before reading the book but it did not change my opinion of the underlying drive. You can't help but to feel for the main characters as they face each obstacle before them in what appears to be an impossible environment. How many of us are looking at our small businesses and dwindling paychecks while trying to plan for a future that appears so uncertain. As long as I struggle in my own life, I'll feel the need to follow the adventures of anyone who struggles so mightily in theirs. This is one reason why we love fiction so much. This is why I'm now invested in the Hunger Games. I need to believe that no matter how bad things appear, there is still hope.
