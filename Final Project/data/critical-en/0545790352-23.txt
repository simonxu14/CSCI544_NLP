The wands themselves are heavy and fairly high quality. The necklaces, however, are terrible. All four necklaces broke the first day my daughter wore them. I would have returned this, but my daughter loves them, so we just purchased new necklaces for the wands. Annoying and disappointing for my daughter, but they are great for any Potterphile:)
