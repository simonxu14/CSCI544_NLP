I'm going to start my review much like the other reviewers by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed the first two installments in this series. The Hunger Games kept me wanting more and Catching Fire, though I was slightly disappointed in its ending, was full of intrigue as well. One of the major components that kept my attention was the relationship between Peeta and Katniss. The love triangle felt oddly familiar (Twilight) but in this series I remained strongly loyal to Peeta.<br /><br />**Possible Spoiler Alerts**<br /><br />This brings me to how I feel about Mockingjay. I was really hoping for an awesome climax to Peeta and Katniss's relationship. The kissing scenes in the other books were descriptive and left you feeling like you were the one kissing a crush for the first time. Mockingjay took all of that a threw it away leaving you with a big dud at the end. I ended up being really confused and annoyed with the entire book with all of its back and forth...who do you trust?...crap. Plus, contrary to the first two books I ended up disliking Katniss and felt that she didn't deserve either Peeta or Gale. She pretty much transformed into this indifferent, self-preserving, empty shell of a person who, not only drove herself crazy, but drove everyone else crazy too. Her defiance became annoying instead of endearing.<br /><br />I can't give any technical opinions on the underlying theme and the way the book was written but I do agree with other reviewers that the ending (and possibly this entire book) was rushed and felt completely different from the other two. I read a review that said something along the lines of we all know war is terrible but that's why there are fiction books, so we can get away from the reality of the already awful things that are happening around us. I understand why the war in Panem was such a large part of the book but instead of ending it with an emptiness that is depressing and removing all of the relationships that kept readers locked into the story --those stolen kisses, or short moments of affection-- it ends up just being a war story. I don't agree that everyone expected a fairy tail happily ever after but the ending was incomplete.<br /><br />I could possibly go on forever because I have about 10 other things I'd like to elaborate on but I'm going to close with saying that I am disappointed in the book - left wondering how in the hell they are going to translate into movies that kids can watch - and wishing that there was some alternative to this trilogy.
