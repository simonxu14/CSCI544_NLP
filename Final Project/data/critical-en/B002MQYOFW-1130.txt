I enjoyed the whole series, but the final book was really different in my opinion.  I think I wanted her to be more happy she was alive. There was an underlying current in the 3rd book that I can't put my finger on, but it wasn't in the first two books. I loved the whole story, and it was impossible to read only one in the series. Go ahead and read Mockingjay, because you need to see how it ends, but to me it just wasn't as enjoyable
