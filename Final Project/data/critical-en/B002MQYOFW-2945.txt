First, it is a clever plot set in a well crafted fantasy world.<br />Second, if you are a teenager, you'll love the story.<br />Third, if you are an adult, you'll be bored.<br /><br />I'm glad I read the story, but I have no interest in the 2 remaining books in this trilogy.  Problems are just too easily and conveniently resolved to hold an adult's interest.
