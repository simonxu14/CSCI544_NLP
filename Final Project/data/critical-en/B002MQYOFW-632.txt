As many other reviewers, I feel like this book is not as compelling as the beginning of the &#34;Hunger Games&#34; series.  I'm not sure why so many writers feel compelled to write trilogies, but they do, and they stumble.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins did good work with &#34;Mockingjay.&#34;  In general, this is solid and imaginative writing, and she brought the series to a thoughtful and logical conclusion.  So why isn't it quite satisfying?  Maybe some things are just best when left to the reader's imagination.
