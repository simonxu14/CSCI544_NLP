i am not a big fan of sci fi which this is but it was recommended to me by several people; i did read all three book, enjoyed the second book the most of the three, while i did enjoy more than i thought i would, it is a lot or reading for someone who is not an avid fan of these types of books; i did see & enjoy the movie but again i would not highly recommend either the books or the movie; they are okay
