Unlike many, I confess that I am not a rabid fan of the "Harry Potter" series.  However, nor have I subscribed to the Professor Bloom school of thought, which relegated "Harry Potter" to the garbage heap.  Indeed, the good Professor feels that such trite prose is deleterious to youthful appreciation of literature.  After having read this final installment, my attitude has altered; for the worse.<br /><br />I find the sentence structure clearly amateurish and plot development shoddy, at best.  At times, I felt as if the author was writing a screen play, rather than a novel. One aspect was especially striking to me:<br /><br />Near the end, the two main protagonists square off in their expected duel; nothing wrong with that.  The audience has expected and hoped for such a confrontation over the course of approximately 3,000 pages.  However, the plot (such as it is) had become so convoluted and negligently developed, that Ms.Rowling was forced to have Harry engage in a lengthy summary and explanation, in order that the reader(s) not be lost in space.  This must be one of the few times that Cliff's Notes has been incorporated into a work of literature.<br /><br />My final concern is the impact that such a poorly crafted  novel has on young readers.  I do not subscribe to the overly utilized rationale that so long as young adults read, it matters not what the literary diet is.  It does matter.  Quality, enjoyable works of prose and poetry are readily available; one need only consult your local librarian.<br /><br />I shall return the book to Amazon and accept whatever credit is given me.
