For as long as we waited for this tome to come out, it was disappointing.  I just couldn't care about these characters as much as I did in the previous books.<br />If you are already a Harry Potter fan, this won't matter - but if this was the first one of the series you had ever read, you wouldn't be chomping at the bit for the next one.<br />More than anything, it just felt as if it could really use a good editor.
