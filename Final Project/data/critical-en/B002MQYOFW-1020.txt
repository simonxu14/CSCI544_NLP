I think the writer is very creative and kept to the plot pretty well.  The problem I have with this book is that it seems like whenever there is a climax someone gets hurt or goes unconscious and so there is a lack of depth, when a difficult situation is handled by unconsciousness and waking up somewhere where everything is being taken care of...it makes the story less believable, more like a children's story.
