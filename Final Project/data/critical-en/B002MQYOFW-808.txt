In the first half of the book our heroine is bitchy, morose, and self absorbed. It's a bad case of PMS. By the end of the first half you pretty much know how the book will end. There are the usual twists and turns in the 3rd quarter which was a nice relief. I won't ruin the last part of the book except to tell you that the only person still feeling sorry for Katniss is Katniss. I wanted a heroic ending and what I got was tedium and self pity.
