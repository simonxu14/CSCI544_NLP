I think you either loved or hated the way things were all tied up. However there are a few of us that were just very "meh" about it. I chalk this up to my need to have a pleasant end for someone and this book just doesn't give that to us. I see no hope or joy just sadness and acceptance. Which might have been fine if I wasn't already to the point of not caring who else Suzanne Collins killed off. There is a fine line between killing characters for emotional impact and just killing. Really only 3 deaths moved me in the book and 1 of them was unnecessary (unless you cared about a tidy way to wrap up a love triangle). In fact, I think that is why I just didn't buy how this was wrapped up. The first two books were about fighting (to survive, to live, to spend with family/friends, to keep family/friends alive) and this book was about ________? Seriously most of it seemed to be about revenge and settling. Most of all I think Suzanne took the strong Katniss that I loved in the first two books and turned her to person I just didn't like. So when I began to dislike her, it just made the whole point of reading the book kind of moot. I think that is where I stopped the first time I tried to read it. I did eventually pick it up and read the last part but I had never done it at one time till the last few days. Even the 2nd time (which was better than the first) wasn't enough to change my feelings about the book.<br /><br />I thought the writing was as strong in this book as the others and the imagery was outstanding. I didn't see a few of the curveballs thrown coming my way and in the end I am glad I finished it. The things that bothered me others will love!<br /><br />Final Thought : I think overall this series did what it was supposed to do: make the reader think and feel
