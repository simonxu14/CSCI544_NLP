Just finished the series which was a great read overall.  Collins writing style in all three books is not what makes them great.  It's the originality of the concept and the world is what really makes them page turners.  I'll echo most of the comments regarding the fact that this book is definitely the weakest of the the three.  I felt like the author was tired of writing her story.  The overall storyline could have been interesting and evocative, but she just summarizes key plot points and leaves out so much you stop caring. I feel like Collins was about half way through Mockingjay when someone came into her office and offered her an ice cream sunday if she would finish the rest of the book that day...and...she did it!
