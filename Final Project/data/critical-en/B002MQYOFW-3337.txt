I find it quite a stretch to call this a "Collector's Edition". Only the first book of the series is included (why not sell the entire trilogy together as they all have already had initial releases?), the mockingjay artwork is less than impressive, the cover of the slipcase was peeling upon arrival, and there is no dust jacket. Compare this to the deluxe edition of the final installment of the Harry Potter series, which was packaged in a high-quality slipcase and contained a dust jacket with full-color art. I'm very disappointed in Scholastic and this product.
