When I started this story I knew I would like it. I settled down with my Kindle and began a four-hour trip (just can't speed through books like I used to!) that started in a fantasy and ended in a media-imposed awkward romance.<br /><br />Girl power! Wow! Katniss kicks ***!<br />Or... Not.<br />It started out that Katniss is this girl-power kind of girl who does most of the hunting for the entire 12th district (Don't...ask...) and she does this with her best friend Gale.<br /><br />See, I really liked Gale. I was TOTALLY ready for them to have a romance, would've been fine. That was because he wasn't someone who would smother or outshine her, but would be her comrade in arms and her lover. But then, Katniss is dragged off to "The Hunger Games" where 24 children or so are put in an "arena" to fight to the death. The last one living is a hero of sorts.<br /><br />Katniss' little sister is called up, and Katniss immediately volunteers herself to go in her sister's place. Wow! What a self-sacrificing, loving, strong young woman!<br /><br />But then, Peeta (something) is also called to fight. Peeta and Katniss, naturally, have a bit of a history. Once, after Katniss' father died and her mother was in a deep depression, her family was basically dying. She was so desperate she searched the rubbish bins behind the bakery where Peeta's family worked. She found nothing, and then Peeta threw Katniss two loaves of bread. As her family was on the brink of starvation, those loaves of bread really saved them.<br /><br />Because of this, Katniss considers herself forever indebted to Peeta.<br /><br />First of all, I'd like to add that I abhor the name Peeta. It sounds like someone is trying to say Peter, but is failing miserably.<br /><br />But that's irrelevant.<br /><br />Even here, the story isn't too bad because you can imagine Peeta and Katniss teaming up and winning the "Hunger Games" together. I imagined it might be like Cedric and Harry winning the Triwizard Tournament together, but without anyone being fried by Voldy.<br />But then, while doing interviews before the battle begins, Peeta admits his perpetual love for Katniss. On live television.<br /><br />Katniss is furious, and rightfully so. But their mentor, a former winner of the "Hunger Games" thinks this will get them more sponsors (people who will send them things to keep them from horrifically dying while in battle.) After all, there have never been two "tributes" (children who are part of the "Hunger Games") who worked as a team.<br /><br />Despite this, as soon as they are released into the arena to grab whatever supplies they can, then take cover, Peeta and Katniss go separate ways.<br /><br />This was a relief. I quite hoped that Katniss would kill Peeta pretty quickly, and then the story could really get interesting. So, so far so good.<br /><br />But alas, what's a good fantasy without romance?<br />Want to know?<br />It's a good fantasy.<br />Without romance.<br /><br />Peeta joins up with the "Careers" (boys and girls who were prepared and trained all their lives to fight in the Hunger Games) and Katniss goes off by herself. At first, all is well. Katniss has snagged a sleeping bag, a sheet of plastic, and a knife thrown at her by a competitor. Katniss eventually reaches water.<br /><br />Then, there is a fire. Fireballs are thrown at and near Katniss and the other competitors, probably to make things more interesting for spectators. Katniss is badly burned on the calf of her left leg and the palms of both her hands. It's quite painful until sponsors start coming through and send her burn ointment.<br /><br />Briefly, Katniss teams up with Rue, a small but lithe and clever 12 year old girl. I wouldn't go into detail, but I'm sure you can guess what happens with dear Rue.<br /><br />When Katniss took action against the Careers, Peeta came and warned her before they retaliated. He saved Katniss' life again, but ended up being hurt for betraying the Careers. When it's announced that there can be two winners (so long as they are from the same district) of the "Hunger Games", Katniss realizes she and Peeta can band together and they have a possibility of making it. (Without having to make hard decisions.)<br /><br />Katniss finds Peeta injured and nurses him back to health. The number of competitors dwindle down, meanwhile Katniss and Peeta really cook the romance to get sponsors to send them food and medicine and whatnot. However, they do feel for each other besides putting on a show for spectators, and you begin to like them as a couple (when they aren't pushing it too far to entertain the sponsors.) Eventually there is a not-so-epic battle.<br /><br />The story leaves me saying "Where did it go wrong?" and quite dissatisfied.<br /><br />They are charging more for the next e-book in the series, which is another reason for me not to return to it.
