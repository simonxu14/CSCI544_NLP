No doubt Collins can write an incredibly compelling book--but I felt with a dystopian young adult novel, she ought to also make some deeper comments and observations. She kept trying to make the books more dramatic, to raise the stakes, and I felt that by the end, she had just introduced conflict after conflict without really resolving any of them. It even is not entirely clear if people have learned any lessons from the Hunger Games themselves. Collins builds an interesting, if implausible, world, and she manages to draw you in well...but after ward, you feel like you have eaten butter and jam without bread. There's no real substance.
