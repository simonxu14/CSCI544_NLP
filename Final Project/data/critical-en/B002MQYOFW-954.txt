Entertaining and interesting. It keeps you interested in the story's development. I must confess that I arrived to this book because of the movies and, like with many other books, the letters are better than the screen. Good for anyone looking for adventures, romance and drama.<br />The Kindle edition is well done (I really would like to see a way to read in justified alignment with my paperwhite)
