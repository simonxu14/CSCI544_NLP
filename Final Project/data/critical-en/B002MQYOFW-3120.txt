Collins has a wonderful basis for a plot and for the terrific characters she creates.  However, the book could be reduced from three to one.  The "Games" go on and on and become redundant; although the tributes are very resourceful, their experiences leave even their world to the far-fetched.  Reminiscent of Lord of the Flies, Collins could have had a wonderful teaching book here if she just reduced the entire trilogy to one book and still could have achieved her goal.  I would not recommend the book to most people because it is just too far out of the box and the message gets lost.  As a former English teacher, I would have loved to teach the book if it were condensed.
