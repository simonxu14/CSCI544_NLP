This was an average sci-fi book.  Not the most creative story and overall not that gripping.  I only learned after reading it that the book was written for a younger audience but it does not matter how old you are with this book - it's just simply not a great book.  There are so many other books of this genre that far more interesting, entertaining and better written.<br /><br />I don't recommend it to the true sci-fi buff.
