The first Potter books were awesome, but this one seems to have little to offer in the way of new experiences, new magic, or new places. Rowling throws in contrived situations that seem to have no purpose in the story other than to fill in space.  Also, she seems to have forgotten some of her own rules for the Potter world.  For example, you can't free someone else's House Elves by giving them clothes, they have to receive them from their master!<br /><br />In this book Harry has become mean and thoughtless for the feelings of his friends.  He is beyond rude to Dumbledore, something I can't believe the Harry of the prior books would have been.<br /><br />By the end of this book, I was ready to put it down.  Overall, a disappointing read.
