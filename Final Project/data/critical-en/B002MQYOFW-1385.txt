I read the trilogy along with my eighth grade son. I must say the first two books caught my attention and I enjoyed the read.<br /><br /> The Mockingjay was an abject disappointment compared to the first two books. If I ever thought a book/story was "put together" to finish a series then the Mockingjay examples that thought. Ms. Collins should be ashamed! The characters seem contrived in their respective circumstances. Katniss shows herself as a whiner; a self-doubter; as a weak link in a line of strong "tributes." Katniss does not deserve our respect or sympathy.<br /><br />My son, when we finally discussed the final book, expressed his disappointment with the book. Maybe not to extent I do or did but in his own way found the book, story line and characters as weak as I did.<br /><br />A very poor conclusion to a very good start.
