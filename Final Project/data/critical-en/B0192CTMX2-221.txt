If you like the Harry Potter series, then you will certainly want to finish it by reading this book. The story is fun as we have come to expect, but at points it is tedious in the extreme and moves very slowly. The second half of the book is much better than the first in that the plot actually moves somewhere. My main problem is that the book simply ended. The final chapter concludes with a three-page epilogue following it, which does not exactly leave much room for telling the tale after the battle. After 7 books, I would have hoped that she would have put more time into the ending, but it seems she didn't. At least at the end of this saga, there are no Ewoks jumping about.
