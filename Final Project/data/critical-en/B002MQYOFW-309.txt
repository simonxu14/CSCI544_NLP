I struggle to find an arching theme here. The third book feels more like a tired stopgap then the climax to a story three books in the making. If there is one topic that is consistent throughout this book...it's the same tired old tale: love struck teenager tries to decide between two boys. What team are you on-Team Edward or Jacob? I mean team peter of team gale?  Who cares!  I wish I bought the paperback so I can burn all three in disgust.
