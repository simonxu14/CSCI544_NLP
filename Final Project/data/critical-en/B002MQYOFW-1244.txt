(I address all three books in the trilogy, because I doubt anybody will stop after this first book.)<br /><br />First two books draw you into a constant fight for survival, with intriguing dynamics of personal relations: enemies, allies, friends. This dynamics is what I liked most in the book, I think the author did a great job making you feel it and empathize. The adventure is engaging when reading, although somewhat falls apart in retrospective (the author leaves loose ends and does not really connect some events or show their consequences, even for important ones).<br /><br />The last books is different. Major action happens in the background, and you do not really see it, just learn the brief news. Most of the time you are tracking conditions of mental hospital patients, going back and forth in their madness. And their conditions do not really feel only violence-induced, they are heavily intermingled with psychological complexes from ordinary life, hurt feelings, hurt consciousness. There are a few episodes of really engaging action, but they fall apart and fail to connect into a coherent picture even more than in the first two books. It seems the author is piling up events just to put her heroes through something, and then let them analyze this.<br /><br />General impression: I enjoyed the book while reading, but it feels very incoherent and somewhat disappointing after I finished it. The story falls apart and is so unconvincing, that it fails to lead you into retrospective thinking, like most good books do. I did like the friend-enemy dynamics.
