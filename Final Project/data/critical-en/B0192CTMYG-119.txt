The story is well loved and I was excited to buy this and present it to my neighbors daughter.<br />I could not believe how cheap this book is made.  The pages are onion skin thin and will tear very quickly.  The paper has a dull grey recycled look.  There is no artwork.  The cover is poor quality.  The entire book is about the size of 2 Reader's Digests put together.  I was expecting the large edition books that everyone had when the book first came out.  I was honestly embarrassed to give this as a gift.<br /><br />So disappointed!
