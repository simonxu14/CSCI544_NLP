While enjoying the four previous books immensley; I was rather disappointed in this long awaited sequel. It might be the longest book thus far, but feel it was unduly inflated (perhaps to assuage the readers long wait). To many undeveloped area's and repetition  of thoughts as though just adding filler. Perhaps the editing process is what let the author and reader down. Or to much time in between writing efforts to maintain a continuative thought process.<br />Nevertheless, will wait to read book six and hope for the best. Four out of five is a great average!
