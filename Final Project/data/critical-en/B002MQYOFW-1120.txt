This book is kind of just a dark, violent mope-a-thon.  It seems rushed and poorly planned.  The story seems to go on and on without progressing.  This book doesn't give the reader the same satisfaction every ten pages or so that I got out of the previous two books. That said, it is nice to see how the story ends, so I would never discourage somebody from reading the book.
