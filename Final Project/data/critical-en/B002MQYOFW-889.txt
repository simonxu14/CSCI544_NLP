I did enjoy the hunger games trilogy. The tale was compelling and the characters were well formed. However, the writing style was rather distracting.  I described to a friend that it read as if written by a teenager. Having said this, the charalcter of Katniss is sixteen/seventeen and the book is written from her perspective so in reflection this may have been the intention. I found the first book to be the best and the second similar but a little too much the same.  I was disappointed that the last book dragged towards the middle but the conclusion was satisfying and wrapped up the story nicely. This isn't a particularly deep read but it shines a light on our current culture and the dark turn our fascination with reality entertainment could take in a dystopian future.  Something to think about.
