This book did bring closure to the trilogy for me.  However, it fell a bit short for me.  I think the story line was a bit contrived and was a stretch.<br /><br />I think the story line could've been a bit more developed and I don't think the author did her readers justice.<br /><br />The only reason I'd even consider recommending the story is because it is the end of the trilogy.  Other wise I wouldn't recommend this for reading
