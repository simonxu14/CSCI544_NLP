Much like the second book, the final book in The Hunger Games trilogy, Mockingjay, has a slow start.  The conditions and situations are so different from the first two books (in my opinion anyway) that it almost seems out of place.  It takes some adjusting, but you finally get a grasp on what is happening and it's not as hard to follow.  Some of the things happening in the last book with enrage you and you'll want to stop reading, but keep your cool and read on.  I have to agree with a lot of the other reviews stating that the author didn't quite know how to end the trilogy.  At times, nothing makes sense and all you can do is read until you understand what is going on again.  A great example of this is Chapter 25.  Chapter 25 was so confusing and jumbled and that's the point where the author started rushing.  After all the confusion at the start of 25 everything happens in a flash and at times it's hard to keep up.  It's like the author didn't know how to make any transitions and therefore everything is thrown in your face at once.  There are some good points to the book as well, not all of it is bad.  The whole action sequence of the taking of the Capitol is a good example.  Although I wan't too happy with the quality of the last book, I'm glad I kept reading until the final chapters.  For once, I could smile about Kantiss's decision when it comes to Peeta.  If Mockingjay hadn't ended the way it did, I don't think I could even look at the final book again.
