***WARNING SPOILERS***<br /><br />Mockingjay is the final book in the Hunger Games trilogy and I must say ultimately I found it disappointing and disturbing even though it keeps you engaged. The final push towards the Capitol is anticlimatic when everyone seems to get to the President before Katniss and her team. Along the way and at the final step, the slaughter of innocent children and adults becomes quite extreme. The shaky mental state and nightmares of Katniss and Peeta becomes quite tedious even if it is understandable in the circumstances. I am at a loss to understand how this series can be marketed as children's books. The violence is so extreme. Is it because there is an absence of any real sex? So any level of violence is OK but sex is not?<br /><br />Suzanne Collins has said that she is interested in the effects of violence on young people but she really seems to celebrate it in this book. She makes you care about the characters then kills them off carelessly. Only the central four characters continue to pull off remarkable escapes. It may be realistic when compared to a real war but do kids need this level of slaughter now to be entertained? I don't think I'll be reading it again.
