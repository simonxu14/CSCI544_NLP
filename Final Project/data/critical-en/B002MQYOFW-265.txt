This volume brings the hugely popular Hunger Games story to a somewhat rushed and not entirely satisfying conclusion.  It is a fast-paced page-turner like the others, but it lacks both the adrenalin-pumping drama of the hunt that characterized the first book, and the modest layering of political intrigue that was added in the sequel.  While the series is enjoyable (in a morbid kind of way) and it is easy to see why it was a hit, the problem with producing a compelling work, whether a movie or a novel, is that it is notoriously difficult to follow up with equal strength.  In the case of the Hunger Games, Collins has not been entirely successful in finding a success formula that would prevent each book from being a bit weaker than the one before, even as she adds a modicum of greater political and social complexity.  Still, even if the denouement seems rushed, there are many things about this concluding book that readers of the other two will enjoy.  The main character, Katniss Everdeen, remains a conflicted, reluctant hero.  The body count is high, and while the different ways of killing don't quite rival Homer, they nevertheless show grisly imagination.  And there are a few characters who don't make it to the final page that you really wish had survived.  So that's saying something, isn't it?
