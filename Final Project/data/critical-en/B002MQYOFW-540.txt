***Minor Spoilers***<br /><br />I absolutely loved "The Hunger Games" and "Catching Fire" but "Mockingjay" was a huge disapointing conclusion to the series. I completely agree with the other One-star reviewers that Collins' writing in this last one was very sloppy and confusing. I had to re-read paragraphs over and over, just to understand what was going on. There were way too many deaths and all were emotionless. The triangle between Gale, Peeta, and Katniss seemed like an after thought once you get past all the deaths and the action that was way too rushed. The ending was the most disapointing thing in the book (That's saying something.) The characters are seperated,(most dead)and Gale's character seems like a side-thought. He just "leaves", as if Collins wanted to get rid of all the characters and end the series as quick as possible.<br /><br />Stick with "The Hunger Games" & "Catching Fire". I just pretend this book never happend.
