I can't adequately express my disappointment with the final installment of this triology, it was really disappointing, and uninspired...and this is coming from someone that loves this story so much that I scheduled month in advance to have the release date off of work, just so I could sit around and soak up the story.<br /><br />I'll admit that the series has always been a rather dark one, but it had that underlying promise of hope for a better future, good will triumph evil in the end, etc.. and characters so real that the reader was really invested in their individual stories. However, that aspect was completely missing in this book.<br /><br />It was almost as if the author wanted to destroy everything and everyone just to make a philisophical point..and I'm not sure what point she was trying to make. We all know that war is terrible, but in every great tragedy their is always something redeeming or hopeful to hold on to. Not in this war; everything of beauty was taken away, everyone is destroyed physically, mentally, or emotionally, and in the end you are just left empty.  Katniss isn't strong, she's dull. Gale isn't down to earth, he's vengeful without a hart. Peeta isn't peace loving, he's broken The last ten pages of the book, meant to be a happy ending?...just aren't enough to redeem the characters, or repair the damage and heartbreak, the reader has experienced.  I fell sad and empty a day later after reading the book
