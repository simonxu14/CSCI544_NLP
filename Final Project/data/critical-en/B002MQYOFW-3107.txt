I am a HUGE fan of the Hunger Games books and as much as I love the series, this book unfortunately fell short from my expectations. Collins did such an amazing job in building up the story line in the previous books that this book just did not seem to do justice to the story. Mockingjay had a really great start but then by the end of it, it felt like the author was trying to condense, what could have been another book, into a chapter. I really felt that the book was rushed 2/3 into the book. Collins could have ended this book with Katniss, and the other rebels, infiltrating the capitol and started another book with that. It was still, however, a great read and I highly recommend reading the entire series to other people.
