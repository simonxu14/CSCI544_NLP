Before I read this book I glanced at the ratings and saw that this third installment had much lower reviews then the previous two installments of the Hunger Games Trilogy. I chalked it up that perhaps people simply didn't like the ending.  After reading Mockingjay I found myself surprised at how disjointed and uninteresting the third book was.  It simply doesn't work as well as the previous two. It's not as well written nor as creative.  The writing seemed rushed and a bit thoughtless. I only gave the book three stars because I simply loved the first two books and the characters and the world that Collins created.  The book is readable and moves along with a decent story it just doesn't keep pace with the other two. I wonder if Collins had given herself more time to write the final book if it would've came up better.  Not sure, but over all I enjoyed the series. The ending? Meh, again it seemed rushed and disjointed.  I'm definitely hungry and excited to see what they make of the movie.  I wonder how they will present this series in film version.  PG 13? It really should be an R rating because of the violence.  Also I think that a Premium Channel Tv Series would've better suited The Hunger Games series.<br />Hunger Games is definitely an interesting and unique read. Mockingjay for me, just didn't sing.
