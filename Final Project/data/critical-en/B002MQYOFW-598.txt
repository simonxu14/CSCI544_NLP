I thought the Hunger Games was easy and fast to read and is a good action story, but its not a book that I fell in love with.  The Hunger Games has some good things that I liked but I also found things that I did not like and that were a problem for me. The things that I liked where the hunting activities. Katniss being a good hunter and providing for her family and taking her sisters place in the games. I really liked Rue and was sad when she died but i was touched when Katniss covered her with flowers.<br />I did not like the romance angle of the Hunger Games because it just felt unreal and forced. I also did not like the mutated wolves and the changing of the rules.
