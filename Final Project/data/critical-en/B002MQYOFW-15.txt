Book 1 was five stars...an outstanding satire on war. Book 2 was bridge to the ending...not quite a repeat of Book 1 as it was much weaker worth 3 stars. Less impact on the gut. Book 3 was a disappointment...as the finale it should have been better thought out. The message was that war is hell is an old one. The message that survivors, the Victors, will be forever changed is an old one.<br /><br />I grew tired of Katniss being perpetually hospitalized, unconscious, or catatonic whenever something bad had to happen. What kind of artifice is that for the protagonist? And again, the love element was just not there. Katniss was too ambivalent. At the end, you have to ask...what happened to Mom?... what happened to Gale?... what happened to the country? did anything change or is it the same thing to be continued?<br /><br />Not an ending that will be memorable or popular.
