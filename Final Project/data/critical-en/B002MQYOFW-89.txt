After reading about this book in the New Yorker, I was really looking forward to reading the book. After reading it,  I have to say that I am perplexed by the cult-like following that it seems to have attracted. This is probably the highest ranked book on GoodReads and I am quite sure that it does not deserve that. Although this does not really affect my rating, it is hard for me to write about the book without mentioning it.<br /><br />The good<br /><br />I found the book well written and easy to read (in a good sense). It makes good use of the first person narrator (Katniss) who is telling us her story with some perspective. The character is interesting and engaging. She is brave in the face of challenges that nobody should have to face. And she is  talented and smart. I can see how she is attractive to many readers. In some ways she reminds me of Bilbo or Frodo Baggins (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/J-R-R-Tolkien-4-Book-Boxed-Set-The-Hobbit-and-The-Lord-of-the-Rings-Movie-Tie-in-The-Hobbit-The-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The-Two-Towers-The-Return-of-the-King/dp/0345538374/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">J.R.R. Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings (Movie Tie-in): The Hobbit, The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, The Return of the King</a>)-- who started out innocent and weak and were forced to adapt to many challenges. Granted the hobbits were quite a bit richer than Katniss!<br /><br />I also appreciate the use of dystopian world to criticize some excessed in our world. A good book should talk to us in a meaningful way.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />However, the story itself is some predictable. Of course, lots of stories are and are still fun. But since the world and character seem quite unreal to me, the challenge also does not seem real. There is nothing wrong with making up a world and this does not normally bother me. But  the best fictional world have a certain internal logic to them. Panem (the country where Katniss lives) does not. It seems to be in our world and yet the economy does not too much sense (10,000 people living in a district mining coal in a rather primitive and inefficient way in a futuristic society with a lot pretty amazing technology).<br /><br />I don't believe that there is a girl like Katniss or a world like Panem. They just seem too perfect (the former) and imperfect (the latter) to me. Although there are a lot of really good heroes in the literary world, it is pretty normal to give them a flaw or two. It makes the story more interesting and all the more satisfying. I guess Katniss has her arrogance, her poverty, and her absolute devotion to her family.<br /><br />Yes, I get the idea of the adolescent rage at the system or the need to rebel or something. And the book shows a strong and spunky protagonist who is doing just that. And yes, I understand the need to scream about all of the commercialism and "reality" shows out there. But somehow, I think that if these are the main issues, the story should have a setting that one can relate to.<br /><br />And I find the violence a bit disturbing. Some books are able to have to great battles without actually showing the blood. Think about the Hobbit (the book, not the movie!), there is lot of fighting but how is it described? I suppose if you want to make a point about the horror of wars or something, you might want to show the pain and the blood and so on. But I don't think that this is the case here at all. In such stories, the ending is not predictable. Also the gratuity almost stands in contrast to the book's anti-commerical and reality show message...we are the ones enjoying it.<br /><br />If you want a spunky girl who has to show unexpected courage (courage beyond the call of anybody's duty), what about&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/To-Kill-a-Mockingbird-50th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/0061743526/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">To Kill a Mockingbird: 50th Anniversary Edition</a>? This to me is a story that is every bit as exciting and not particularly predictable. And a heck of lot more profound.

Both of these points manage to make their points quite effectively without any of the violence.
