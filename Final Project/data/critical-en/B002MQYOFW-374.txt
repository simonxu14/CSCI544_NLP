Yes, I do find it entertaining.  Yes, I find myself getting swept into the thrill of it.<br />And then I look at myself and see how easily I become just like the citizens in the story.  After a moment or two of horror at these &#34;games&#34;- children being forced to kill children- after an initial moment or two, I find myself falling into the mass hype of it, the fun of it, the fact that everyone's eagerly anticipating it and wanting to share the experience.  So it's okay, right?  I see children and parents flocking to it together with great smiles and excitement.  ~And yes, the story does have a few moments of real lessons, about real compassion.  But when I witness myself deep-down cheering for Katniss to kill someone, or for anyone to die (as long as they are not Katniss or Katniss's loved ones) l really need to stop. I have to take a look at that, and register the horror of how easily I have just slipped into such feelings, barbaric, hateful, dangerous feelings, that I dedicate my life to opposing.  It is not in line with the person I aspire to be to think even for a moment that I hope someone suffers harm.  The fact that it's only a story, or only a movie, does not matter; this is where we get our heroes, how we practice who we will become.  ...So, just because a story is powerful and thrilling and makes me feel alive, doesn't mean I should honor it and follow wherever it leads me.  Suzanne Collins is a powerful storyteller, and Hunger Games is a thrilling tale.  For myself I can say: This is not a good thing.  ...I'm surprised that when I talk about this with friends, I can't find one single person who has these thoughts. Wow.  What is going on?
