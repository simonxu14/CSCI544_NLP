Of course everyone is going to order and read this installment of the Harry Potter series, so why write a comment about it?  Because it might be worthwhile to parents of younger children.  If you want a relaxing and fun read, this is definitely NOT it.  I am going to try and hit on a few points without giving the book away.<br /><br />For one, too much politics!  I understand that Rowling had her hands full with the ending in "Goblet of Fire."  But still, I was so sick and tired of the constant whining going on that I got a headache!<br /><br />Secondly, when did Harry develop this sudden attitude problem and rage?  I know Harry turned 15 in this book, but it's really too sudden and shocking.<br /><br />Third, why all of a sudden is Ron breaking out from under Harry's shadow?  It seemed like Ron was the major upbeat character in this one while Harry was off being angry at everything.  Why now?  We never found out. (Yet, anyways.)<br /><br />Fourth, the entire Harry and Cho scene (without giving anything away) was simply ..., odd, and disappointing.  Why even bother?<br /><br />Finally, we come to the ending.  Could someone please slap me?  I suffered through the entire book for that?  Has Rowling run out of imagination?  That's the best she could come up with after four years?  Ridiculous!<br /><br />Needless to say, I was quite dissatisfied.  I am hoping it was a set-up book for the next one.  (You know, like the last "Star Wars" movie.)
