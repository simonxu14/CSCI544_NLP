Like many others I started dedicating a good portion of my life to the Hunger Games trilogy after the engrossing first and second editions. The third starts out where the others left off, but about 40 pages before the end it is like a completely different book - full of anti-climating sap and needless prolonging of non-events.<br /><br />I have seen the word "betrayed" in other reviews, and I think that is the perfect word for the feeling you will have after reading Mockingjay. I would say if you are looking to purchase the third installment, just dont. Stop at Catching Fire and retain the excitement you felt reading the first two.
