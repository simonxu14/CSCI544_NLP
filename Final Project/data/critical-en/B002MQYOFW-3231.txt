I have read this before on a loan and bought the 2nd and 3rd book brand new. I wanted to read the first one again then go through the series. I couldn't fine the first book in store so I found it here and have no problem buying used when in good/great condition. I was given a date  to receive. Well....that changed and just about 3 weeks later I'm still waiting at the mailbox. I've already read 2 other books just waiting for this one....if it ever gets here. Never have a problem with Amazon sellers with good star ratings but I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THE SNAIL PACED SELLER AGAIN!
