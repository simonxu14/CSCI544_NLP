I was looking forward to reading the last book of the Hunger Games Trilogy because the other two books were so good. While the story is interesting, I was not as impressed with it as I was with The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. The ending left me a little flat and confused. With that being said, it is a must read after having read books one and two, to follow the story full circle of the girl named Katniss.
