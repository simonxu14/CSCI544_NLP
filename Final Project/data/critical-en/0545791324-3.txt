I ordered this for our daughter, who is home from college for the first time since early August. She's in school 9 hours from home and just flew in today. She opened it and it is ruined! Pages are torn in the top of the book and many stains throughout. It's a terrible waste of money. I wanted her to be the one to open it, and missed the return date. I'll not preorder again.
