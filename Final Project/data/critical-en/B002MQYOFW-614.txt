I was tempted to give a 4-star rating but the smart pods and other traps lurking at every step were too much of an exaggeration.  But I liked the conclusion  and the way the heroine managed to settle the score. I guess one would like to think that our species will eventually progress to more civilized and humane forms of society but that may just be wishful thinking.  Overall, I enjoyed the trilogy and I would recommend it to any true fan of Sci-Fi .
