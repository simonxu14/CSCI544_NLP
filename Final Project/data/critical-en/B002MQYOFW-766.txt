Hunger Games and Catching fire were fantastic. I sped through them as each chapter ended with its own little cliff hangers. They were very hard to put down.<br /><br />At first, I did not care for the first person narrative, but it seemed to make sense the further the story evolved. The first two books were centered around Katniss. So, the story from her point of view made sense.<br /><br />My only gripe is the required suspension of disbelief needed for some of the plot devices. For example, unless a wire is insulated, once it touches the ground, any electricity passing through it is "grounded".  So, the whole tree thing didn't quit make a lot of sense to me in terms of their planning to electrocute the others.<br /><br />Now Mockingjay... yikes!  That was truly an awful book. The Katniss, Peeta, Gale love triangle was sophomoric. I get these books are intended for teen girls. But come on!  It became an annoyance every time the subject was brought up.  Katniss is a survivalist who turns into a simpering child anytime she's around them.<br /><br />Also, it was evident the Collins has not done ANY research on archery or the military. Pretty much every moment Katness spent with the 13 military was painful to read.  And that moment that she shoots down a bomber (that's in range of her bow) had me actually laugh.<br /><br />It seemed mockingjay was rushed and sloppy.
