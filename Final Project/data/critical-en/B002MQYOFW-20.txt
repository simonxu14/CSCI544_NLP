While I will say that I wanted to keep reading, it just is not a great book.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a mix of Roller Ball, Death Race 2000, and The Running Man.  The plot is well-documented in other reviews.<br /><br />My issues with the book are few, but are significant enough to justify a two-star rating.<br /><br />The Ending.  I believe it was too abrupt and almost 'tune in next time for the exciting conclusion of.....' aka 'buy the next book'.  The book lacked complete, or at least adequate, resolution.<br /><br />The Psychology.  The story centers around children, most being randomly chosen by lottery, who fight to the death in "The Hunger Games" as a penalty for a past rebellion against the ruling Capitol.  They are dressed up, trained, and prepped for the spectacle which is broadcast to the nation on television.  Speaking for myself, being placed in this position, I would be in a state of stunned shock - even if the games had become an accepted but despised evil in society, as I'm sure many readers would argue.  The author set the main characters off on psychological tangents, such as admiring how good they looked in their costumes,  how well their interviews went, how good the food was, etc...  Being placed in the same position, did not ring true to me.<br /><br />The Morality.  The book creates a very strong moral dilemma: "as an unlucky participant in the Hunger Games, I'm going to have to kill innocent children, like myself, simply to survive".  The book sets up a horrible situation for the main characters and then, I believe, lets them off too easily.  This is especially annoying when the 'rules' of the Hunger Games are changed (three times!).  I could give many examples, but want to avoid spoilers.<br /><br />This really is a Young Adult book, which unlike many, will not satisfy the majority of adults (but apparently I'm in the minority).<br /><br />I will say again, the book was compelling enough for me to look forward to my nightly reading sessions, but has some major flaws.
