I am STRONGLY ambivalent about this book. It is either a 5 star book (I did indeed love it and could not put it down), or it is a 1 star book (I hated it, and found the story and violence despicable).<br /><br />I am very glad I read it, but I am very sorry it was written. Let me agree, as did President Snow with Miss Everdeen, I will not lie to you. (IF you can believe THAT!) The story is exceptionally well thought out. The games, blown large to involve rebels vs capitol, are revolting, nauseating. The story made me want to find a place to hide and bury myself in silk! (I think Ms. Collins intends that effect, that she is out to manipulate the reader's mind, just as President Snow is out to manipulate and terrorize Katniss' mind.)<br /><br />The story is ominously a sign of our times. Are we indeed approaching such and end, Ms. Collins? that such a story needs to be written? I would guess our own president would do well to read this cautionary tale, as we emulate our enemies in willingness to take out civilians, our own as well as theirs, to achieve tactical and psychological victories.<br /><br />This is indeed a psychological twister of a thriller, and Ms. Collins leaves no doubt as to how she intends the reader to work through this maze of a literary minefield. Mentally exhausted at the end, I personally find myself wanting to emulate Katniss, and just count (and contribute to a list) of the good things I see people do each day. There are indeed worse games one could play.
