I liked the Hunger Games, but I wish I'd skipped the second two books. The first book has just enough closure at the end, you could probably be okay.  The second book isn't terrible, but it does not have closure, it leaves you hanging, and it propels you right into book 3.<br /><br />I hated book 3.<br /><br />SPOILERS BELOW:<br />--<br />--<br />--<br /><br />A WASTE: One of the fascinating things to me about Book 1 was the way it made me wonder about our own society's fascination with reality TV and violent entertainment.  It made me think of "Survivor", the Roman Colosseum, of British colonies, of slavery, and the way we follow the deaths of our celebrities.  It was exaggerated, but it seemed like an interesting commentary on us as a society.  It was also a good read, suspenseful, creative, and full of interesting characters.<br /><br />I enjoyed the major characters, but I really wondered about Cinna, the news folk, the people in the Capitol, the people in other districts, the government structure, and so on. How did those people tick?  How could they support these kids -- and watch them die?  How do you become a fashion designer for the games?  Why?<br /><br />There were many other intriguing moral, philosophical, and social issues raised by the book.<br /><br />Unfortunately, books 2 & 3 seemed to turn President Snow and President Coin into cartoon-like villians and let all the other people off the hook. This seemed to conflict with the fact that the games were 75 years old, and that the viewers had enough power to stop Peeta and Katniss from committing a dual suicide with the berries. These facts suggest larger societal forces that go beyond Snow. But in books 2 & 3, Snow and Coin were suddenly responsible for everything. By focusing so heavily on District 13, I think the truely intersting story of the Capitol was wasted.<br /><br />The main characters suddenly changed beyond recognition, and the side characters were lacking in depth and many of them were killed off. Too many to really keep up with.<br /><br />I think that Collins started out with a good set of ideas.  I am not sure why she abandoned the Capitol and her initial characters.<br /><br />POORLY WRITTEN and SILLY:<br /><br />I started getting distracted when President Snow showed up at Katniss's house in book 2. I did not understand Snow's fixation on Katniss.  The whole bit about the berries starting the entire revolution was far-fetched. It could have been the straw that broke the camel's back, but obviously there were big problems --problems much bigger than Katniss's berries.<br /><br />In 70+ years of Hunger Games, no other contestants had ever fallen in love? Or pretended to? Or cared a bit about each other?<br /><br />Furthermore, Snow could have handled Katniss --with all the tools at his disposal (cameras, his knowledge of her sneaking out, any contrived or trumped up accusation, one of his poisons, an accident). But why waste so much energy on her?  His obsession with her seemed childish.<br /><br />I kept thinking of the scene in Austin Powers--between Dr. Evil and Scott:<br /><br />Dr. Evil: Scott, I want you to meet daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers<br />Scott Evil: What? Are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?<br />Dr. Evil: I have an even better idea. I'm going to place him in an easily escapable situation involving an overly elaborate and exotic death.<br />---<br />Dr. Evil: All right guard, begin the unnecessarily slow-moving dipping mechanism.<br /> [guard starts dipping mechanism]<br />Dr. Evil: Close the tank!<br />Scott Evil: Wait, aren't you even going to watch them? They could get away!<br />Dr. Evil: No no no, I'm going to leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, I'm just gonna assume it all went to plan. What?<br /> Scott Evil: I have a gun, in my room, you give me five seconds, I'll get it, I'll come back down here, BOOM, I'll blow their brains out!<br /> Dr. Evil: Scott, you just don't get it, do ya? You don't.<br />---<br /><br />After I got this image in my head, everything just started to seem really stupid.  Why the pods?  Why the really complicated death traps? Why did everybody think Katniss was so much more important that she would be in such a situation?  And who would waste that much money on the Hunger Games? Unless the whole society was really economically supporting it. And why would the rebels spend so much energy--risk so many lives--to get their "symbol" out but leave the other 50% of the symbol behind in a way that would weaken Katniss? Why couldn't the rebels rescue both Katniss and Peeta?  Why would the game designer of want out?<br /><br />Why could Cinna (a clothing designer from the Capitol) be so heroic, while all the Victors seemed to be falling apart?<br /><br />Why did President Snow bomb everybody -except all the people Katniss cared about?  Especially if he wanted to "get" to her.  Snow wasn't convinced she loved Peeta.  So why didn't he just take Gale, Prim, and Katniss's mom in for questioning and wisk them off to the Capitol before (or instead) of bombing?  No--he bombed the whole district, but conveniently missed all the key people.<br /><br />And why did Katniss need a soldier's uniform by Cinna?<br /><br />Instead of really exploring the Capitol, we were forced into "District 13."  The book suddenly reminded me of "A Wrinkle in Time," when they go to the plant controlled by It.  Or "Watership Down" --but those books had already been written. They didn't need to be rehashed.  And it was a way of avoiding what I really wanted to see--the way everyday folk lived in the Capitol--the way the people of the Capitol would react to Katniss's destruction of the Arena.<br /><br />I really didn't like that Peeta got his mind so messed up, but if you are going to do that do it right.  It was handled in a very sloppy and way. It was far from compelling.<br /><br />As many others have noted, many of the charaters changed significantly.  I didn't recognize them.  They didn't change the way people naturally change--it felt like a team of ghost writers who didn't know them was writing book 3.<br /><br />When the pods came in, I was wondering if they were more focused on the video game version they hoped to sell than they were on the actual book.<br /><br />I believed Katniss in book 1, but I stopped believing her in book 3.<br /><br />Many of the side characters were 1-dimensional and confusing.<br /><br />DEPRESSING and VIOLENT:<br /><br />The very long list of Katniss's injuries and recoveries was straining belief.<br /><br />I am not a huge fan of violence, but I can tolerate it when there is an important artistic message.  I did not find there to be any sort of artistic message to the 3rd book other than "oppression is terrible" and "war is terrible." True enough, but these messages entirely squashed the characters, and they aren't new.<br /><br />Emotional abuse: Why beat down and beat down and beat down on a character like that? What's the point? Especially when it becomes so repetive, unbelievable, and uninteresting?<br /><br />It seemed to me that the author (along with Katniss, Snow, and Coin) totally forgot that Katniss was just one teenage girl.  Most people (let alone a traumatized young person) don't single-handedly start, lead, or end revolutions.<br /><br />It wasn't all about Katniss anymore.<br /><br />I got horribly depressed the way Katniss seemed to blame herself for so many injuries and deaths.  Yes, I know there is such a thing as survivor's guilt, but Katniss seems like she would recognize the limits of her own ability to impact things.  She is not devoid of power, but so many things were outside her control. She routinely took on guilt for the bad actions of the Capitol, and was unable to see that her inability to stop the cruel, calculated, and powerful forces of the Capitol was not something she should feel responsible for.  Do your best, hope for the best, but lay off the guilt trips, Katniss.  It wasn't her idea to invent the Hunger Games, to start a revolution, to fight for her life, or to fight for her family.  I am not surprised that she felt some guilt--but the crushing guilt over everything seemed too much.<br /><br />The way she kept blaming all the deaths on herself seemed to diminish the fact that many grown adults made grown-up decisions.  Cinna knowingly chose to do what he did. Finnick chose. Magda chose.<br /><br />Many other people chose.<br /><br />And most of Katniss's choices were designed by the Capitol to be impossible choices--like "Sophie's Choice." I think she could have seen that.<br /><br />Even if I was curious about the love triangle, I wish she hadn't wound up with either Gale or Peeta. She didn't have to end up with either one.<br /><br />Once Peeta tried to kill her, I wanted no more romance.<br /><br />I could go on, but I won't.<br /><br />I was so disappointed.
