************************SPOILER ALERTS*************************************<br /><br />  Like everyone else, I loved the first 2 books: the female protagonist was strong and resourceful, the stories were clever and engrossing...but what on earth happened with the 3rd book?? It was almost as if this story had characters with familiar names, but completely different personalities. What is worse is I did not like any of these newly written characters. Katniss became weak and nothing more than a puppet that spewed a few angry diatribes aimed at the government and President Snow. And she did not get to display the skills and cunning that had made her so strong and thrilling in the first place. Gale, always loyal and protective, (I always rooted for Team Gale) did a 180 degree turn and became a hollow, uncaring militant figure. And Peeta, don't get me started on Peeta's character. I was very disappointed with how his part in the story was written. Whenever he was part of the story.<br /><br />  The deaths of Finnick and Prim, important driving characters in the first 2 books, died to add drama and angst to the story, yes, but they died in a couple of descriptive sentences. And then they mattered no more. What?<br /><br />  Why wasn't President Coin mentioned before this book? That might have made her appearance in the story less jarring. Otherwise, she was completely unnecessary and would had made more sense if written as an evil military figure.<br /><br />  Why on earth would Katniss even think to vote for another Hunger Game?? She was fighting the government to end them! How could it be revenge for Prim? Perhaps a distraction for Coin?  I was not able to read Suzanne Collins' mind for that answer. It certainly was not in the book.<br /><br />  Then there's the ending. Gale goes off to another district with "a fancy new job"? Even if he and Katniss do part ways in the end, his former character would have gone home to rebuild District 12. It was hard to see how Katniss could marry Peeta after spending more than half the book ignoring him, fearing him or wanting to shoot him. The way this book was written, Peeta should have died. Plain and simple. His new character would have become a martyr. None of this makes sense.<br /><br />  I waited so long for this book and I knew it be bittersweet. But, dear God, I did not think I would be so annoyed and truly disappointed by it.
