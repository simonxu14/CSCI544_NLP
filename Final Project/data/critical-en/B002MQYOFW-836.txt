This book was a big change from the other two books in the series and i must say i loved the first one and this one wasnt my favourite, i hated the choices that Katniss made in this novel, they were prety hasty and some made no sense, she ended up in a real state in this novel, i am not going to metion what happened in the end but i felt as if the ending did not fit onto the begining. It didnt seem right and it was soooo sad, i found myself with wet eyes sooo many times, wishing that i was there to help Katniss make her decisions. On the other hand the auther has a very nice talent for writing fiction, she has lots of ideas and it could seem as if she had experienced the type of living, her sentence construction is so perfect yet so confusing at times though she writes beatifuly. Thank - You for this book that inspired me so much.
