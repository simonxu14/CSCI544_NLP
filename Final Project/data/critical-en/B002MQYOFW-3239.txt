As a fan of books that allow me to escape the work a day world, I had heard much about this series.  It is certainly a quick read--easily read in about six or seven hours.  The book merits special recognition for a novel plot, but I must admit that I was disappointed.  The writing was terrible, or maybe it was the editing because someone should have fixed the annoying switches between first person and third person narrative.  For example, in the first chapter, it reads "I prop myself up on one elbow."  It seems to me properly this should have been written "I propped myself up on one elbow."  I could have wrote this off to style, but later in the book this "style" switches between the two forms.  I find it very difficult read something from a "writer" that has such poor grammar.
