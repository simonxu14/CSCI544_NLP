I received my audio book yesterday. I started listening to it with my 1st period class and it started skipping. I looked at the disc and it is all SCRATCHED up!  I looked at a couple of other discs and they are scratched too. I have already started reading this with my class and do not have time to return it. I'm very disappointed.
