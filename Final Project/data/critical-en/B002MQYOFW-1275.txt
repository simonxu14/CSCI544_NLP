I must admit I was expecting more. After watching the first movie I bought the trilogy hoping to escape into it but found myself getting a little frustrated at times with the book. Not that I don't think it's a great story, I actually love the plot but I honestly got bored with the attention given to the relationship saga between the 3 main characters. It felt all too similar to the Twilight trilogy!
