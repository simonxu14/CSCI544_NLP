After having devoured the first two books, I greatly anticipated the conclusion of the trilogy.  I noted the rating of the book was lower than the other two, but wanted to know of the conclusion of this great series.<br /><br />The ratings didn't lie.  The first two books follow a similar exciting formula of participants in a gladiator arena.  The third book breaks from this and takes a great deal of time to get its feet under it.  It really isn't until the final 1/3 of the book, that the action really takes off.<br /><br />Kaitniss also spends a great deal of the book in a funk and moping through the novel.  This is very different from the frist two books that show her to be a fighter of amazing strength.<br /><br />If you've read the first two books as I had done, you can't help but want to finish the series - and I would encourage one to do so.  However, know going in that had this book been on its own and not the conclusion of the trilogy, it would be unlikely to gain much acclaim or interest.
