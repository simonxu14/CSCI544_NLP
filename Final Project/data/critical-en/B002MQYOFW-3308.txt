If you're reading this, is because you want guidance before purchasing these books. Just let me tell you these books are completely not worth it.<br /><br />The story telling is by far the worse I've read in my life, first person is interesting and compelling when well written, and this is not the case. Is just plain boring and it never gets to the point.<br /><br />The character development (as for the 1st book) is just unexistent, the characters are threated like doornobs basically the whole book, except for maybe 2 or 3 people. The 2nd and 3rd book DO have a lot of character development  for everyone besides the protagonist, and that's the only reason I could finish the books.<br /><br />The story ONLY gets a bit interesting in the second book, and even then, it feels like you're going nowhere while reading. I have to admit that it was worth it by the end of the book, where everything starts to make sense. (Not that slow stories with great and shocking endings are not bad, I love them, but Catching Fire was barely interesting).<br /><br />And the third books makes up for ALL the slow pacing in the 1st and 2nd books, everything happens fast paced and basically the plot is bananas, nothing really makes sense.<br /><br />Besides that, the protagonist is either just plain stupid or she has some mental problems, which would make sense in the setting of the book, but I think is the former. She is given clues about basically everything during the whole saga and she never realizes any of the clues. It makes me feel offended as a reader to have such to stand a character so dull and unintelligent.<br /><br />Out of all the books I've purchased and read in my life, this is the one I regret the most. They have no re-read value whatsoever. You'll be better off reading better written books with similar, deeper and more intelligent plots. Just don't go to "Related Products" or "Customers read this also bought" because all you get is Twilight and 50 Shades of Gray (which, I can say it with confidence because I read them both in order to properly critize them, are the same). Instead, you can pick up Battle Royale, which you can just get really cheap in a bookstore.<br /><br />TL,DR<br /><br />Go ahead and read something else, don't waste your money or time
