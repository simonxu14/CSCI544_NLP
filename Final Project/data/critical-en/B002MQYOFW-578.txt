I found this book lacking some personality in Katniss she seemed more annoying and less strong... And with gale why would she kiss him if she loves peeta.. the Old katniss in the first book didn't want to get married but then she goes on kissing gale just because she was lonely. With the peeta thing i was soo sad i really liked Peeta. In the end i was kinda hoping for a fairy tale ending but really they had to face reality katniss ended up with peeta but the end seemed almost kind of rushed to me.. so overall least favorite book in the series.
