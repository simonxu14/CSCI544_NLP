Mockingjay deserves a 2 1/2 out of five stars for myriad reasons.  First, the writing is sloppy and rushed throughout, especially in the last third of the book.  For example, several potential plot points are foreshadowed and then left unfinished.  Before Boggs dies, as an example, he tells Katniss to "kill Peeta and don't trust them", meaning Gale and her other companions.  The end of the story neither fits with this statement nor makes sense because her companions- including Peeta- turned out to be trustworthy.  Why did Boggs say this and how was it integral to the story?  This statement would have been more appropriate and the story would have been much more interesting if one or more of her companions- such as Gale- had been moles working for the Capitol.<br /><br />Then there's Gale and her mother.  At the end Gale takes a 'fancy job' in District 2.  Really?  'Fancy' just doesn't fit his personality at all and nothing in the book would suggest he developed into a materialistic person.  Cold blooded, yes. Fancy, no.  The author clearly rushed to wrap up the love triangle.<br /><br />And, what mother would abandon her sick, broken daughter and choose to never see her or her grandchildren again?  The mother supposedly had grown from her earlier ways of abandoning Katniss and to have her revert back to that behavior was out of place.<br /><br />Finally, Katniss herself seemed to understand that violence has no place in an advanced, civilized society yet she willingly voted to continue the Hunger Games and she shot Coin, which were out of character for someone trying to stop the cycle of violence.  It didn't make sense because she seemed so sick of violence and fought so hard to stand up against it.  With more character development the author could have come up with a better way to illustrate her problems instead of just turning her into a 'crazy lady'.  In fact, with better character development the author could have created a much more intriguing story.<br /><br />Not a good end to a magnificent series.
