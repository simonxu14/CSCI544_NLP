The whole series falls apart in this final episode. Katniss truly becomes someone you can hardly stand much less root for. The author goes for the shock value of losing everyone in war as though it is some integrity badge found in reality of war, when the books premise is a complete fantasy to begin with.<br /><br />The ending makes little sense of what we watch in character development. Was this book written in two weeks??? and edited in one????<br /><br />Talk about ruining one of the potentially great heroines in recent fiction. Katniss is turned into a bumbling fool and the pawn of everyone.<br /><br />Extremely frustrating read in almost every chapter. I decided the author was so committed to being unexpected that she ruined the whole thing.
