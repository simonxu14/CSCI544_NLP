First I need to express that I do love this trilogy regardless of what I am about to write. I think the author is an exceptionally talented writer and I am only making a complaint out of personal frustration with the end. I still have not been discouraged to tell people to read this trilogy. I feel every character has their own identity and Suzanne Collins shows that she offers a lot of talent and brilliance to her readers. I know that many people will not agree with what I am about to write but I feel the need to express my feelings.<br /><br />Now to the subject of my review...<br />Why I am annoyed with Peeta's character!<br /><br />...SPOILER REVIEW...<br /><br />I became annoyed with Peeta when he openly admitted to all of Panem, during national live television, that he's always had feelings for Katniss. Peeta's declaration for love was a form of entrapment.<br /><br />Peeta delivers his news during a live national broadcast which in turn leaves Katniss exposed and vulnerable to his secret. Katniss never actual has time to consider her non-existent feelings towards the estrange Peeta. This news engulfs Katniss into a whirlwind of scandal. This is the foundation of my frustration. The rumors and allegations are all for the sake of more sponsors and a hopeful advantage that one will return from the Hunger Games.<br /><br />What about Gale?<br /><br />Granted Katniss is not at all Gales property but Peeta rightfully knows Katniss and Gale obviously have more than just a friendship. Katniss deserves a chance to confront her feelings for Gale prior to being pinned down by Peeta's devotion to protect her.<br /><br />When Peeta voices his feelings for Katniss he automatically puts her in a situation FORCING her to play this "star cross lovers" ROLE.... "real or not real?"<br /><br />Peeta doesn't even consult Katniss regarding whether this makes her uncomfortable, which it obviously does at the time, and brings me to the question of... "turn on or turn off?"<br /><br />....In my opinion this is a big turn off.<br /><br />I feel like this makes a big impact on Katniss because now she has to appease what the people of Capitol want. Instead of being able to distinguish her true feelings she is forced into having unknown feelings and mixed emotions. The effects of his announcement leaves Katniss preprogramed to have feelings for Peeta. Is this for the sake of the game? In my opinion Katniss is hijacked long before President Snow ever hijacks Peeta.<br /><br />Eventually her feelings become more solid as the story develops but the whole storyline of there love makes me feel uncomfortable. Peeta, Haymitch, Capital, President Snow, and many others force a relationship and build on feelings that Katniss never truly had before. It starts off as an act and a tactic for survival and develops into something much more.<br /><br />The games make Katniss and Peeta's bond grow stronger and during these certain circumstances Katniss and her love for Peeta start to unfold develop and change. Leaving Gale without a fighting chance to prove his true feelings for Katniss.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is what causes Gale an unfair disadvantage. Katniss and her forced relationship, has taken away from Gale getting to show what he is truly capable of offering her. Gale will not be able to prove the lengths he can go for her. Katniss is barely even thankful that Gale will be willing to do anything to provide for her family, even if she is never to return.<br /><br />Finally Gale is given his chance, while Peeta is held captive by Capitol, but Gale doesn't hold a candle to Peeta. Peeta's safety is all that Katniss can think of.<br /><br />*When Peeta finally returns I had this extreme happy feeling when Katniss almost has to shoot Peeta dead- while having to try to escape the underground. To be honest, all of Mockingjay I had found myself hoping Peeta can not recover.<br /><br />I do not feel satisfied with Katniss and Peeta's bond. It is because the ending came so abruptly and I was not given a sense of attachment for Peeta after reading the first two books. I had the feeling that Katniss and Peeta's relationship was never as emotioinally developed it was not as natural as She and Gales. Katniss and Peeta's love always reminded me of an arranged marriage, something that was forced on by current events and other people. The influence of tragedy they endure is what molds the road ahead. I never truly connect with this bond though. Katniss and Peeta go through a shared personal experience from the twisted games. Capitol leaves scars that will never truly heal because of its brutality. This still did not give me enough reason for Katniss to have a change of heart towards Gale.<br /><br />Although Katniss and Gale share a devastating history of events, its as though Katniss loses all her past important moments with Gale. In this last book, Katniss completely pushes Gale out of her mind, basically making their past becomes a lost memory. Both Gale and Katniss fathers die in a mining accident. This devistating event forces Katniss and Gale to become their family providers at such a young age. They find each other because they start to hunt for game, this leads them to become hunting partners. After years, because of their closeness they develop a strong friendship and a possible blossoming romance. Katniss and Gales previous experiances is what has help to mold and make the relationship grow. Setting up a feeling of comfort for the reader. Their situations have force them to become stronger individuals. This bond is some how forgotten after the return from the hunger games and the relationship is forced to severly suffer.<br /><br />I don't feel like the relationship between Katniss and Gale should have drifted apart the way that it has. In the first and the second book Katniss always thinks of Gale while away at the games. As the trilogy comes to an end the author gears Gales personality to really get involved with throwing over Capitol. It is as though his life goals change more than half way through the third book and the perception of who he is dramatically changes to the reader with in the last quater of the book.<br /><br />The reason I became so attached to Katniss and Gales relationship is because she always worries for his feelings and doesn't want to disappoint him. Gale is always a thought in the back of her mind. She has an apparent love for Gale. The bond from growing up in the Seams and having to be the livelihood for their family. This gave me as the reader a sense of common ground. Even though ultimately Katniss decides to be with Peeta. Gale has to give up because he realizes Katniss lost her desire of affection towards him.<br /><br />The ending of the book happens so fast that I felt left off in anger and frustration. I felt heart broken for Gale. He is forced to give up his bestfriend, his love, and now must feel forever guilty that he most likely was the reason for Prims death. This was the hardest part reading the end of the trilogy for me. Not only does she choose Peeta over Gale, Gale is the person that causes Prim's death. It was entirely too unreal for me. Gale made for an outstanding protector of the Everdeens. The ending was like a carpet being ripped from underneath me.<br /><br />Not for nothing, I felt a whole lot of empathy towards one character. Their was never any clarity of what had become of Gale. Not only this but Gales character was left with an unresolved and heartbreaking goodbye. I feel I would have much rather read Katniss ended up alone if not with Gale.
