It finally has ended and with that comes the conclusion so many of us have been waiting for... for personally it was a disappointment in many ways.  Her set-ups are not as strong as in the past, there is way to much information given in this book that could of been planted better in other books and the deaths that do happen don't feel like they should have the most impact that they could of.<br /><br />3,4,5 are her best books to date - 6 is good but lacks in time as does this one.  The opening action is good and when they do make a movie I think it might be a cluster mess like 3 was unless it's split into two halves.
