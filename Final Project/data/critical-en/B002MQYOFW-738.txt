While I must admit that, as an instructor, I had to read the first book in the series because it is a required reading for our Freshman Success Seminar, I quickly moved on to books two and three.  Suspense and curiosity all tied together with a messy little love triangle, and unanswered questions kept me going.  What will happen to the districts?  The capitol?  Who will Katniss choose?<br /><br />Book three started out with the same up-close experiences that we enjoyed and feared throughout the first two books.  The districts move in on a revolution behind the reluctant leadership of a heroine who knows the struggles facing the poorer districts,and is willing to sacrifice her life for her family, friends, and the betterment of Panem.  As readers, we were right there in the trenches with the rebels, Peacekeepers, and laymen alike.  Sharing their hunger, their pain, their fear and hope.  And then, bang!  Everything stops.  We are removed from the first hand, close up feel of the battle, left gazing through a fog at the lives we have come to learn so much about, and left gasping for air somewhere along the perimeter of the story only to come back chapters later to find that it's over.  The choices we so eagerly anticipated, the heart wrenching decisions that we should have been a part of were taken away from us and decided somewhere in the periphery by someone other than the one person (Katniss) to whom the choices actually belonged.<br /><br />I felt cheated; as though someone stole the most essential chapters and left me with an incomplete copy.
