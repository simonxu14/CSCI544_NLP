Well, I have very mixed reviews on this series.. I didn't want to get involved from the beginning knowing the plot somewhat, but for some unknown reason I had to finish the series. It was very depressing from the beginning an  I just kept waiting for something, anything good to happen, but that never did happen. I was disappointed even at the ending. I expected Kaniss to become this great leader but she seemed very weak until the end. I think I will stick with the love stories next time.
