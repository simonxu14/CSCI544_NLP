Bought it, read it, completely unimpressed.<br /><br />This book is an unrealistic rip-off of Japanese thriller 'Battle Royale' ("In the future, the Japanese government captures a class of ninth-grade students and forces them to kill each other under the revolutionary "Battle Royale" act." - IMDb) plopped into the setting from Scott Westerfield's "Uglies" trilogy (also disappointing).<br />Unlike "Battle Royale", however, Hunger Games has a plot hole so enormous it threatens to swallow you whole - while the Japanese government is taking hostage a group of about 30 children and threatening them with weapons as a means to population control, there's never a clear reason why the eventual "uprising" that is so momentous in the HG series doesn't happen right from the start. Their pathetic "government" has no real method of threatening the villagers, and no real population would be so blunderingly obedient in the face of blatant neglect.<br /><br />Overall this book is horribly predictable, unoriginal, and certainly not worthy of yet another delusional teen fantasy film series a-la 'Harry Potter' and 'Twilight' . Let a good book be a good book; let bad books die. One star because the writing wasn't horrible and MUCH better than a lot of the other teen trash kids are reading these days.
