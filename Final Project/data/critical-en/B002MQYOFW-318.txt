This book is the final and darkest in the Hunger Games series. I think the author added too many things for shock value and the end was a bit rushed and contrived. I wanted to learn more about Katniss and Peeta's future as well as the futures of others. Finally, I regret the fact that the author brought a huge element of mental illness into this version. I thought that was very insensitive and also forced her to miss out on an ending where the main characters are actually contributing to society, not living on its edges. Overall, a disappointing end to what could have been a phenomenal series.
