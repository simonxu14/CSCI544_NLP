When I read other reviews for this book I was a bit put off by the vast number of negative reviews for the book.  I found the first half of the book a bit slow versus the first two books but perhaps it was necessary for character development for the amount of trauma and development all the characters went through in the first two books.  I absolutely loved, loved the first two books.  This one took quite a while to develop, the second half of the book is quite a whirlwind and I won't spoil it for anyone but now that I've read it I found the end quite fitting for the story line.  Others might not think so, and might find the end a cop out but Katniss was a character pushed out to her limits and while I did find her litanies a bit monotonous by the third book I'm really glad where her character finally went in the third book.  Other characters not so much but you can't everything in a series such as this, thanks Susanne Collins for a mostly great trilogy :)
