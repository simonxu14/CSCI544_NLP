I absolutely LOVED the first book in this trilogy.  The character development, the insight, the details, all fascinating, I couldn't put it down.  This trilogy started going downhill with the second book, Catching Fire, then totally collapsed with Mockingjay.<br /><br />Spoilers<br /><br />The book began with some promise, a new life in 13, the past, etc.  But I never felt connected with Katniss the way I had in the other books.  Sure, she's shell-shocked, but goes through long periods of time being drugged up, unresponsive, uncomprehending, etc etc. and Collins takes the time to describe every boring detail of these periods.  The final 1/3 of the book seems cheap, like Collins needed to come up with an ending.  Main characters are killed off with no purpose, the plot stops, then goes again, then stops.<br /><br />When it ends, it seems like Collins took the easy way out of the long love triangle and political thriller she's weaved, and we don't know if things are better now or worse for the people of Panem.  I was hoping for and expecting more.  I don't know how the heck they're going to do this one as a movie.
