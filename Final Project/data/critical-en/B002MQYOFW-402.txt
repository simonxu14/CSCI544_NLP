So many reviews, so many differences of opinions on why SC wrote the book the way she did. I'm not giving a synopis, as so many have already been given. I just wanted to post my opinion. Me, my husband, my daughter and her fiance have all read the series (LOVED the first two books!) and each of us, at the end of this last book, agreed that it was a MAJOR disapointment. From beginning to end, it is totally unrelenting in a mire of hopelessness and despair. After reading the epilogue, I burst into tears and sobbed for a half hour.  It left me completely depressed.  Who wants to re-read a book that is that depressing?! I certainly won't.
