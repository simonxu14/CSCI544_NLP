Without giving anything away, I just want to say that I was really unhappy with this book. The first one was exciting to read, but this one was a struggle to finish. Katniss got on my nerves, I didn't like the love triangle between Gale and Peeta and Katniss, and the epilogue sounded more like something the author had to write instead of something she wanted to write. I should have stopped after the first one.
