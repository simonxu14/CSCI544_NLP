The weakest of the Harry Potters, but still fun none the less. It lacks the depth of characters of the later books, and the new innocence of the first book, and never quite finds its place in the series. While the first book is effectively an introduction of the series and the characters and the third book introduces the true, dark plot of the series, the second gets lost in between.<br /><br />That having been said, its still a wonderfully entertaining book and more than worth your time.
