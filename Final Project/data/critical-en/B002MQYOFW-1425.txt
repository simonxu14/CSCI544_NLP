...and a miss!!  What a truly pathetic ending to what could have been a classic.  Collins shifts her tone so fast in this book to a preachy, in-your-face war story that all of the characters that were wonderfully fleshed out through the first two books simply fade into the background never to be seen again.  Her first person POV that flourished in the first 2 books, flops miserably in the final rendition.<br /><br />This book is demoralizing and just down-right depressing.  I can appreciate and didn't expect a fairy tale ending.  That would have been a cop-out, imo.  But this book follows down the opposite path so much, that it as equally unbelievable and unsatisfying.
