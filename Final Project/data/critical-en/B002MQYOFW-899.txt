The book was good, the plot wasn't something you normally find, so bonus points there. But in my opinion the book lacked depth, that thing that makes you want to keep reading. The characters seem slightly empty in the way they are described. The emotions of the characters was not there to me. You couldn't feel Peetas love, nor Katniss' desperation with Prim and the games. Not many things were described in detail which would give you a better understanding. It didnt make you feel as  if you were watching the games or maybe even part of them. You couldn't feel that.  Now granted this is coming from someone who's only fourteen but thats my take.
