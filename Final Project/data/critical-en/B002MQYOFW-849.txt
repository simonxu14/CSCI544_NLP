I personally believe this is a very fitting end to the trilogy as a whole. But it has serious problems handling the more traumatic segments, and very little seems to be thought out in regards to the mission to kill Snow. The destruction of the Nut is made out to be a very important event in the plot, but it is not even alluded to at all ever again. And If it was, it was so weak that I can't even remember it. And why does Katniss not have serious guilt issues over the death of all her friends? The absolute only reason Finnick, Messalla, Castor, and like 5 other people were brutally murdered is because Katniss wanted to kill Snow that badly. At one point she even tells them they can go back to the camp and let her go alone. Their deaths are ENTIRELY her fault. And this is not so much as acknowledged by anyone! Nobody cares Katniss dragged over ten people to their deaths!
