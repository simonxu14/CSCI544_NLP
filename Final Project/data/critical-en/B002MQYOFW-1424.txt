The first two books were amazing!  I could not wait for this one to come out so I could find out which guy Katniss would end up with.<br /><br />Sadly, this book did not touch my heart like the other two.  This one was predictable and dull.  The ending was incredibly unsatisfying.  It's as if all that I invested emotionally in the characters through the entire trilogy was wasted so that the author could preach to me about the evils of war.  While it was a technically "happy ending" there was no romance and passion in the book at all.
