The boxset was wrapped in an air tight plastic cover but there was some time of glue or residue on the spine of one of the books and all of the books corners seemed to be dented/damaged in some way.<br />The books are perfectly fine to read but I was expecting them to be in brand new condition with no exterior flaws.
