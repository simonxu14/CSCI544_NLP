I just can't handle this kind of brutality. I started reading this book at night after I went to bed. Read about half the book. I turned off the light to go to sleep, but I could not go to sleep. I was up all night.  I'll admit the writer is really good, because I could picture everything so vividly. But if God gave you the talent to write this well, write something  uplifting & joyful.  I will not read any more of her books, unless she calls me personally and tells me she has written something that will make me so happy that I cry with joy.
