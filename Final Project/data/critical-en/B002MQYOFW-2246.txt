Is proof that we are more concerned with being 'in with the cool thing' than actual quality.<br /><br />If you have not read any one of the following I would recommend going here first:<br />Frank Herbert<br />Louis L'Amour<br />Steven Erikson<br />Gary Jennings<br />Anne McCaffrey<br /><br />The literary quality of these books is negligible, it's moralistic overtones are thrown on like so much cheap cologne, and you'll spend all your time in a state of agitation because of the irrational urge to choke the life out of the idiotic twit that passes herself off as the main character.
