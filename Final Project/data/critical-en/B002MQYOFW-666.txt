The final book will really knock you out and ruin the whole series. I've finished the two books about three days ago and I'm a fan of this mockingbird thing until I read this finale. Long and dull battle things, forever narrations without taking too much actions. You don't feel much emotions behind this finale but boredom and plainness.
