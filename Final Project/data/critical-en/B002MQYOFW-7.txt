The first book was excellent because of the depth of well developed characters who drove the plot.<br /><br />The second book was good, but you could tell the plot was starting to take over<br /><br />The third book....well, here's what you get for characters<br /><br />1. People too physically and mentally broken to continue<br />2. Corrupt people in a lust for power<br />3. Likable people who die pointlessly and without detail or emotion<br /><br />and the plot isn't that great. Predominantly, it's hospital rooms, crying, and fake promotional war footage. What's happening with the real war? God only knows, it's not like it's driven by the main characters. But, you understand by reading the book, it's cruel and pointless and lots of people die for no reason apparently...oh yeah, and there's a half-baked happy ending tacked on so that message doesn't make you want to give up all hope for humanity and jump out of a window...
