It finally had to end.  The first book in the Hunger Game series.  It's a pretty simple story... take one of the oldest and most popular stories (The Most Dangerous Game), and update it.  Change the name of the characters and the story location... and boom!  Although I had higher hopes for this one, the writing to wrap it up still left me plain and wanting.
