It is the first book/movie that takes a realistic depiction of violence and its effects on a person. If you want a great adventure and a happy ending, this book is not for you. This book is a real life depicition of survival, violence and the effects that it has on a person's soul. Most characters are either tortured souls, violent agressors, or are unable to sympathisize with others due to their status. There are some that do sacerfice their lives but that is even questioned after so much life is lost.  I found myself really wanting it to be different/really wanting some characters to live but this book mimics real life...not always a happy ending.
