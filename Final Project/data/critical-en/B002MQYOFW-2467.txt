Horrible disappointment. I LOVED the first two books. Read them both twice. Recommended the series to everyone I spoke with. I was afraid to start Mockingjay b/c I was afraid I wouldn't want it end. I wish I had never read it. It was dark and depressing and nothing else. Terrible conclusion to what started out as a great series.
