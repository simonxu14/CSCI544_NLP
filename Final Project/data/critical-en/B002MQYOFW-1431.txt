The third part of Suzanne Collins "Hunger Games" trilogy.  Although I enjoyed the story it didn't flow as well as the first two books:  Hunger Games and Catching Fire.  It took me 100 pages or so to "get into" this story in part because of the change in the some characters particularly Katniss - whom the book revolves around.  Ultimately the seeming change in the story line and characters does make sense.  I would recommend the book if you have read the first two.<br /><br />I am glad to hear that some high school English classes in our area are using this series with their students as I think there are many  ideas worthy of discussion in the trilogy and the author's writing style should appeal to teens.
