Suzanne, I really loved all of the hunger games. Until this. I don't like it, at all. Everyone is saying Katniss breaks down, I'm saying why didn't she break down more? I'm not giving away spoilers, but when that bomb dropped, I started hating this book. I know this isn't Harry Potter, or Twilight, it's a lot better than that. But no. I really don't like this book at all. I might think different if I read it again but I doubt it.
