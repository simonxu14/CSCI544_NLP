I mostly read this because everyone on Quora seemed to tbe talking about it.  I'm a big fan of post-apocalyptic fiction/dystopian fiction in general.  However, it appears my interest in more intellectually demanding fiction probably dominates, and my main interest in post-apocalyptic fiction is "how characters use a realistic environment to survive".  The situation in the book is totally contrived, and aside from Lord of the Flies style violence, pretty limited.  Apparently the later books in the series are supposed to be better, but the first book already lost me as a reader.<br /><br />This felt like Harry Potter (which I also haven't read), which is understandable given that the book is written for young adults -- of which I'm also not a fan.<br /><br />So, while I really didn't like this book, I wouldn't necessarily steer others away from it.
