The first two books in the Hunger Games Trilogy were kick ass and punched me right in the emotions. But this? Uh-uh. It seemed like a REALLY bad fan-fiction, especially the epilogue. All the characters seemed whiny. The occurrences in this story were random and not tied off very well. There were twists in the plot that left me with a big, fat, question mark hanging over my head and one of those dumb cartoon droplets on the back of my head. Maybe Collins was rushed into getting this written, and if that's the case, I feel fer her. As a writer, I know full well how much more my writing can suck if forced to do it within a time crunch. But still, this was just too disappointing of an end.
