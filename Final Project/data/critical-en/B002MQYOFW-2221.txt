I'm not sure what happened to Suzanne Collins as she was writing the 3rd Hunger Games book, but I think she completely fell asleep.  I got very angry the more I read and it did not end the way it could have.  If you haven't started reading it -<br />DON'T - create your own ending.  You'll be so much happier!!!
