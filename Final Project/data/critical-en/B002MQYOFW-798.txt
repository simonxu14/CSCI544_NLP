After reading book 1 and 2 i had to find out how the trilogy ended.  although book 1 and 2 were staged in fantasy land, book 3 took on the tone of sci-fi.  It totally took off in strage directions both with the plot, characters and setting.  I read all types of books but I have to say that I felt lost at times in Mockinjay.  There were scenes that I had to re-read in order to make sense of them and I found myself going back to try to re-trace the origins of significant references.  The last third of the book was confusing and quite a disapointment.
