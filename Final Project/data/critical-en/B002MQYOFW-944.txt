I read this after seeing the movie (out of curiosity more than anything else...I wanted to see if the similarity with Battle royale stemmed from the book or the movie).<br />It's an entertaining read, but is definitely aimed at young adults. The writing style is, at times, overly simplistic with the writer appearing a little lazy, but the speed at which you can read the book makes getting over this easy enough.<br /><br />Read if you're looking for an easy read that wont take up much of your time.
