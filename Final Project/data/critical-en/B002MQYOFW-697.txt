SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS<br /><br />Being that it's been a while since I read the other books and I finally got around to reading the last one, I had forgotten how gory these are. One of the reasons I hate them. I don't want my children to ever read these books. No one under 16 should read this series but especially this last book. As an aspiring author I think that is what the most difficult for me to stomach. That someone came up with such a gory and twisted story. And it only makes it worse that it's geared to teens.<br /><br /> I've found it hard to find a book with a main character I really love. I can't think of a book I have read since Harry potter where I don't find the main character dreadfully whiny and annoying.<br /><br />I had to re read the beginning of chapter 25 a few times to try and grasp what was going on but it never completely made sense. What was going on there? Seriously.<br /><br />The ending wasn't as depressing as people painted it out to be. It has a relatively happy ending - mostly - she ends up with Peeta and lives mostly happily ever after - begrudgingly becoming a mother. Honestly I wish she had just killed Coin and Snow and then just killed herself. Or at least grew a pair, moved on and wasn't a mopey mess.<br /><br />And the entire book really drags. I had to force myself to read it not just skip to the end and read the last few chapters, which I wish I would have done. They are really splitting it into two movies? How? Part one will be boring as hell. Don't waste your time reading this book. I at least hope they change the story for the movie and at least paint Katniss into a better role model...
