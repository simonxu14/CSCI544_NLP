I absolutely disliked this book.  As other reviewers wrote, it is distasteful. And to me, pointless. I read a lot and love a good science fiction story but absolutely did not understand the allure of reading an entire book about children running around killing each other. I read half the book and I am sure there is a deeper story in its pages but I'm not willing to grit through the gruesome deaths to get to it.<br /><br />I will not deny that it is a page turner.  It is.  What I did read, I read in 3 days.  And then I skipped to the end (just because I wanted to know what happened) and then deposited the book in the abandoned magazine pile at the gym.  If you like the idea of the story, then you should absolutely read the book.  But if the idea turns you off, like it did me, go with your gut and do not read the book. I wish I had never read it in the first place.
