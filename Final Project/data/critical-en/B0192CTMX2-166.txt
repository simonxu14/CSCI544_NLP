This one isn't my favorite, but once it got rolling I enjoyed it. The first half of the book could have been pared down a tad - found it tedious, and found myself getting irritated with Mr. Potter's teenaged petulance... it felt overdone - there could have been less and the point still would have been made. As with the other books, loved the details and the some of the side stories - these are the elements that keep this book together. Once things start to roll in the book I liked it - although it's essentially the same story as the others - these kids just don't seem to learn from experience! (Something I'm going to have trouble swallowing in the next installment.) Glad to have read this - but if the next one is like this one, getting through it is going to seem like work.
