Spoilers<br /><br />Rating this in sections, I'd give 2 stars each for the first 2 sections, and 4 or 5 to the last section. SC's intent through the series -- i.e., show war bad -- demanded a less than happy conclusion... which she delivered on, while still providing some measure of hope... a nice realistic finale that pulled no punches (though I wonder after Rue's and Prim's deaths if Collins has a thing against her younger sister :).<br /><br />The first two sections were slowly paced and a bit chaotic. Collins introduced ideas that were dropped almost immediately (e.g., hallucinatory FX of drugs) and had some ridiculous plot points (e.g., shooting a plane w/ a bow and arrow.... not gonna happen, deciding to avalanche The Nut... that would have been early strategy #1). The final section, however, was typical Hunger Games style... fast paced, inventive, exciting.<br /><br />As far as the KGP triangle character & plot development, nothing seemed out of realism for me, though I could have done w/ less introspection on K's part, though that's a hard cup to measure.<br /><br />On a final, minor, sideways note, I felt like my mental image of the world was a bit off compared to SC's.... Never realized there were phones and cars in future world until the last section of the last book.
