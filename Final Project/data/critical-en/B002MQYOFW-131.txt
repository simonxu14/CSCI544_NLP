The Hunger Games is really little more than a repackaging of past stories.  There's Shirley Jackson's The Lottery, some Orwell's 1984 and even some aspects of Stephen King's Running Man (though probably more the movie than the book).  The characters are flirtatious yet chaste - yes, I know the book is for young readers but I would prefer they read about healthy relationships than barbaric savagery comprised of killing children for entertainment.<br /><br />Despite these overriding issues, the story was basically flat for me, I can't say it was horrible.  Collins has used some good material in creating her own story, and the movie, which was also just okay, has made me slightly interested in reading the next book though I probably won't spend money on it.<br /><br />Lastly, I've allowed my 9 (now 10) year old read both the Harry Potter series and Ender's Game, but I'm not letting him read this one because I don't think it's good enough to warrant exposing him to the violence of it.
