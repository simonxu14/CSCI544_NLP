By the time I read the last in the series, I was thinking, &#34;Why am I bothering?&#34;  The second book was boring enough, mostly the brave, embattled Catniss fighting for justice.  The ending was disappointing, especially who Catniss ends up with. The first book, by far, is the best of the series.
