While I'm a big fan of hunger games... I wasn't overly thrilled with this addition.<br /><br />There are a two primary  reasons why:<br />1. Suzanne switches gears on us with this book. The series had blended well earlier and flowed, but it seemed out of sorts that she all of a sudden wanted to end with a morality lesson on war and that even its survivors lose something(along with a nice little dig that no side is guilt free). That's a true point, but it doesn't sync well with the first two books that allowed the protagonist to exist in a world where frankly she would have been put down relatively quickly. If Suzanne's goal was really to accomplish what she wrote in the last book, the first two needed to be far different.<br /><br />2. The second half of the book felt horribly rushed. Aside from the stupidity of having the cqb in the city take on an element of the arena, the writing itself was disjointed and lackluster. It didn't flow well... And since it was so jerky the author didn't really have the chance to invest in the story other than to kill off a few people and wham we are standing in front of the mansion.<br /><br />It's great that Suzanne brought some life lessons into her story... But they just don't coexist well with her first two books in the series. Hopefully in future books she doesn't cram endings the way she did with Mockingjay. If you need the space, add on an extra book. I'm sure we'd all happily pick that one up as well.<br /><br />Regardless, it's still a must read as a cap stone on the trilogy.
