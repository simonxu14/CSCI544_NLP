The first book was pretty good, the second book began to annoy me and I did not care for the last book.<br /><br />I gave the trilogy three stars because I felt the last book was pretty weak and did not do the first two books justice. Also I do not believe it was the author's intention for me to be so annoyed by the characters by the end. I did not hate them, but their development was not fleshed out and became tiresome, predictable and annoying.<br /><br />Overall it was an okay read. I usually like books much better than their movies, but this is not the case with this trilogy.
