Overall it was a good read and an exciting conclusion to the series, yet there are just too many loose ends that I would prefer to be resolved. Also I thought the evolution of Katniss' character became a little too morose and, again, incomplete.<br /><br />Series such as these are often difficult to conclude, I can appreciate, however I felt too much of the side plots went unresolved here.
