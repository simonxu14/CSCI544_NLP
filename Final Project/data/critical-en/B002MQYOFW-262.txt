I have to agree with the other one star reviewers.  The first two books were so riveting and well written and I loved them.  However, this book was simply awful.  I hated practically every minute of reading it, but I had to finish  to see what happened at the end of it all.  The characters lacked the depth and personality of the first two books.  Collins seemed lost when writing this.  Several times I found myself saying, Katniss would not say that or do that.  The characters were like cardboard cutouts of themselves.  The story was not developed well at all.  Because it was so disjointed and the character development so bad, which was so different from the first two books, it felt like it was written by a different author who totally didn't understand the characters and was just trying to emulate Collins but fell way short.  The way it ended was not even remotely believable.  Prim would have never been at the front line of the rebel attack acting as a medic.  She was 14.  Ridiculous.  I know Collins was using that trying to stoke Katniss' hatred for Coin, but it was too farfetched and contrived.  And the quick fairytale wrap up was abrupt and out of place with the rest of the book.  This third book was so disappointing.
