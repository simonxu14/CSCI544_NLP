It's never easy to finish a series, but I felt with the way the first two had been set up, an equally spectacular third book was achievable.<br />Maybe I read it too fast, but everything that happened just felt way too rushed. By the end I just wanted to finish the book and get it over with.<br />Katniss's romance with Gale and Peeta was hardly an aspect of the plot. It was almost like she didn't even care about them anymore. Or anyone, really.<br />I got really lost during the trek to the capitol. I could never work out the scene in my head, and I had to go back a few pages every so often to see what had happened. Also, I didn't really get the whole point in killing Snow. I couldn't think of why that would solve any problems, and I kept forgetting why it was so important.<br /><br />Katniss seemed so strong at the beginning of the series, she did what she wanted, but in this book she hardly made any choices. I suppose that was the part of the plot, but I didn't appreciate her sense of spirit anymore.<br /><br />I didn't like the epilogue much either. She seemed so depressed, and it didn't even seem like she loved Peeta all that much, rather that she was just settling for him.<br /><br />In the first two books, there were a lot of unexpected twists, and things happened that I didn't expect. In this book, I don't know what I expected, but it was more than what I got. Two stars - readable, but in light of the previous two, unsatisfying.
