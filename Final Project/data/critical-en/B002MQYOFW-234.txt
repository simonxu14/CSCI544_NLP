I absolutely love the premise of these books, however I am concerned with the premise of kill or be killed and the violence aimed at the YA readers.<br /><br />I am worried that I am worried, as I don't believe in censoring books and encourage everyone to read. However in today's world of social media, and a generation that is so easily influenced,it is nonetheless disturbing. I dislike that being disturbed was the main thing I took away from this series.<br /><br />Now it is in Hollywood's hands, which makes it doubly worrisome. All the Young Adults want to emulate the main character, to the point of taking archery lessons. That in itself is frightening, as kids are able to purchase cross bows, what are they thinking by doing this?<br /><br />So as you can tell I have very mixed feelings on this book. Excellent writing by Suzanne Collins, she really draws you into the characters and creates a very surreal futuristic world, which has you rooting for the characters. I couldn't put these books down,but would not recommend them for YA readers
