I read the first two books in the series and couldn't put the books down.  But this one....well....I had to struggle to get through it.  It was a real struggle until about two-thirds of the way through, then the action picked up.  But the book really was a disappointment.  Unfortunately, the third book needs to be read to resolve all the issues generated in the first two books (I can't stand unresolved plots!). But if unresolved plots don't bother you, don't bother reading this book!
