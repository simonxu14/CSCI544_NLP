Spoilers!<br /><br />I was really disappointed!  The writing seemed much different than the first two books. Didn't want a fairy take ending but why kill both Finnick and Prim? It was a much more depressing book than the others as we have had an emotional attachment to these characters.  It seemed almost rushed.
