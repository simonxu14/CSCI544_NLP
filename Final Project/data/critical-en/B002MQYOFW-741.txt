Well she lost it, this was nearly not worth reading. I mean after the first and second books you are in love with Katins and all that she is and fights for, this is the only reason to read it to see how it all ends and who finally wins. Don't get me wrong it's a good story but she just lost the brilliance and standing on your toes type of writing.
