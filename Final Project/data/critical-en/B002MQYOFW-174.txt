The first book was a master piece but it seems the author had no real plans after that. The second book she gets it together and slides by with another success but not as good as the first. The third is lot the author wrote herself in a corner and had to throw something together to get on the shelves. She looses touch with the story and gets lost in politics. She kills off all the wrong characters and strips nobelity off the others. I was glad that these books were not just another twist on twilight but I am disappointed in the trios ending even though she ends up with the one who best suited her after she becomes the mockingjay. The set up for this book and the events are 50% rediculus and by now is DONE to DEATH. I could not be more disappointed and wish someone would rewrite it. But you got to finish it don't you so just buy the dang thing. Maybe the movie will be better.
