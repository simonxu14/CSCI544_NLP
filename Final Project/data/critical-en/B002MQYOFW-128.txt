I was enthralled with the first book.  Excited by the second book.  Mind-numbingly bored with the third.  I found myself barely reading it after a while... I just kept skimming through the pages, stopping once and a while for an important conversation, and then skipping forward some more.  It's not a bad book, and I can even get over all the deaths, and I don't even mind the ending, but the way the story unfolded was dull and far too long.  It dragged on and on until I had no interest in it.<br /><br />Katniss suffers from an overabundance of chaotic and redundant thinking, constantly debating how numb and destructive her entire life/world/existence is - It just doesn't have the same "spark" as the first book.  I feel most of the plot was simply "filler" to lead the reader on a wild goose chase before finally getting to the end of the story.  There really was no story, other than "Who will she end up with?" The side stories did little to distract the reader from the desperate need of the main character to get to that romantic resolution, and little attention was paid to developing the self awareness/esteem of the main character.  As some people have suggested, the third book may have had greater potential if it had been told from Haymitch's point of view, instead of Katniss'.<br /><br />I think the other problem is that authors often have this insane notion that senseless deaths add to the weight of the story, but sometimes, they are just a lead weight that sink the story.  I felt as numb as Katniss in the third book, and that was about it.  Just numb.  And perhaps that's because that is all I really felt the story had to offer by the end.  The ending didn't have enough warmth to snap me out of that numb feeling.  It's worth the read, but I feel this last book was forced and manufactured without proper editing.  Perhaps we can beg for a "redo" in the movie version.
