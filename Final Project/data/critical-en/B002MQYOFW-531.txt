Overall, Mockingjay is a great story with all of the elements that made the first two books successful. But can you say rushed? I honestly feel like there should have been four books, not three. The ending had the feeling of being completely rushed and thrown together. So much so that it felt like Collins was dealing with a page limit and had no choice but to smash 300 pages into 50. Is there such thing as a mulligan in literature?
