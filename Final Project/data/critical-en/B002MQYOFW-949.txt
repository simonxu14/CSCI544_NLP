The series is entertaining.  Got this for my grandson, who also enjoyed it.  The rating reflects how he feels about the plot and its unfolding.  No dislikes.  Would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good story that is well written and imaginative and, in a way, reflects the struggle for survival in *third world countries today.  The anxiety and necessity for food for family and self is used by the warring/competing powers that be to manipulate people. * In the U.S. & other so called developed countries, accessibility for food is somewhat modified by government programs such as food stamps.  But food stamps can be sold for cash with which to buy drugs and other &#34;commodities&#34; in the underworld economy.
