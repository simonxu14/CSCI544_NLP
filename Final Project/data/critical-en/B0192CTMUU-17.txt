Book was billed as very good condition, but had creased cover and worn pages!<br />The book is of course the 4th in the Harry Potter series. It branches out from the others in that it introduces that there are other schools besides Hogwarts, in other parts of the world. Unlike the movies, the book gives more detail of the other schools, the headmasters/headmistresses, and the students who attend. It also gives much more depth of the relationship of Harry with his godfather, which is particularly ignored in the movies.
