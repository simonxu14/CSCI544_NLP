The author made katniss weak and I didn't like it she kept second guessing her self and very overly emotional. And the fact that the author decide to kill Prim was lame when I read that part I wanted to stop reading but I had already bought the book so I had to keep on reading how this now lame ass book was goin to end  and it got no better she never talks to Gale again or seen her mother. I thought putting her and Peeta together wasn't a good choice thumbs down on that. I read the second book catching fire and jus love it goin into the three book I expected nothing less than great but it didn't compare its been three weeks sence I finish the book and I'm still disappointed.
