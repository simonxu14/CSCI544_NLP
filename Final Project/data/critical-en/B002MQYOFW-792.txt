I'll keep my review in vague terms for those who still want to read the book, though I'm warning you now you may not like it.<br /><br />After being captivated by the first two books in the trilogy and then reading this one, I got the sense that Suzanne Collins was either on a stringent deadline with the final book or just lost interest in it altogether.  Either way, I think the quality of the writing and the story suffer for it.<br /><br />First, the pacing is terrible.  I had a hard time getting into the first half of the book because it seemed to drag on forever without really going anywhere.  Then the second half speeds up to a frenetic pace, which is exciting for a while, but then it's just exhausting.  Details are glossed over. Character development is almost non-existent. Then in the last couple chapters, the author doesn't even bother to tell the story anymore... she just kind of sums it up, creating an abrupt, thoroughly unsatisfying ending.<br /><br />Second, I understand that a great story does not require the "happy ending" that we're all hoping for.  But it does at the very least give the reader something to pause and think about, a lesson learned, or an admirable demonstration of character worth aspiring towards.  At the end of this book, I felt I'd experienced none of these.  Other than the obvious "war is miserable", what kind of enlightenment did Collins intend for her readers?  What can we learn from Katniss, who--despite coming through hell and back--doesn't seem to learn much of anything herself?<br /><br />Finally, the people who will feel the most let down by Mockingjay are the ones who were drawn in by the romatic love triangle, which Collins built up so well in the first two books.  I was on edge the entire book wondering how she would resolve this.  Who would Katniss choose, if at all?  Unfortunately this aspect of the story is treated as no more than an afterthought in the rushed ending.  If the Hunger Games trilogy was never intended to be part romance story, then the first two books should have never led us to believe it was.<br /><br />This book left me feeling empty.  A story that holds so much promise deserves a better ending than what Collins gave it.
