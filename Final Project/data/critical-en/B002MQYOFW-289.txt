The idea of the the nation-state sponsoring hunger games and it's motivations for doing so are well developed and clever. The brutality of The Lord of the Flies doesn't emerge since the children in the games are thrown into it unwillingly. The games, the weapons, the motifs are perfect for those brought up on the video game format, especially in the final rush for the Capitol Center. I felt that the peculiar relationship and feelings held for Gale and Peeta should have resolved much earlier.<br /><br />In all its not that bad a book for teenagers, especially girls.
