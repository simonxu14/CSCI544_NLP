The first 2 books hooked me, mocking jay both saddened me and angered me. While the irony wasnt lost on me, I did not like the direction Collins took here and I feel betrayed by her. Without revealing too much about the ending, I will just say that I was drawn into the series and &#34;fell in love&#34; with many of the characters, only to be left heartbroken.
