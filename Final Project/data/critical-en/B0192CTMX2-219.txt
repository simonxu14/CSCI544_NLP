Perhaps a second, more careful reading will change my opinion, but this is a hard book to review.  As a standalone book by itself, it seems to be a bit lacking in some structural tenets at times, including muddied rising action, climaxes, and falling action.  As the culmination of a seven-book series, though, it comes very close to being everything it should be, delivering the final climax of a story that spans seven books, the resolution of all unanswered questions, and the final denoument.<br /><br />That said, it's unlikely that readers will be disappointed by the book.  You're more likely to get swept up in the action and stop paying attention to the structure of the story.  Rowling wraps things up neatly and satisfyingly, even if sometimes disappointingly.
