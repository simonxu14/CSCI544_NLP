I wanted to love this book.  It's a wonderful thing to find a long work that earns your respect and keeps you mesmerized for hundreds of pages.  Like Robert Graves with I,Claudius or Patrick O'Brien with his Aubrey/Maturin series.  But The Hunger Games is not even close to being in that league.  It's not even a great book for bright pre-teens.<br /><br />The author gets off to a fine start.  Great pace; perceptive and balanced character development, an imaginative description of a strange post-apocalyptic world. Too bad that fine beginning devolves into unbearable dreck after the first 30 pages.  And stays there to the bitter end.<br /><br />I assert that in the real world, post-apocalyptic or otherwise, men and women span the spectra of heroism, evil, intelligence, avarice, initiative, boorishness, wit, backbone, and everything else human in roughly equal measure.<br /><br />But in the author's self-indulgent world almost all the men have almost all the flaws, and almost all the women have almost all the admirable traits.  Jeez, give it a rest already.  This one-note samba is not the tune to which great books dance.<br /><br />Furthermore, the author is irritatingly lazy and unimaginative.  When she needs some Deus ex Machina she just plops it in, with little backstory and almost no credibility.  The heroine needs some medicine? Plop! It arrives via a little silver parachute, paid by a of a destitute populace who can barely feed themselves.  This sort of abuse of our willingness to suspend disbelieve happens over and over again.<br /><br />This book is jejune, uninspired, and banal.  Too bad, the author obviously has talent --- someone should teach her a little judgement and an eye for reality.
