I would give the first 2 books 5 stars and this one also, but the ending was just an end. It left so many questions. I hope there is another book to read about how they said goodbye to Gale. Maybe some about the wedding. And most of all, leading up to the kids. I'm waiting another book otherwise this was a big disappointment.
