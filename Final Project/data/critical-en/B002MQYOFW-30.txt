I eagerly bought the last book in this series, having been completely enthralled by the first two. And I wanted to love it. I wanted to go on that emotional roller coaster again, riding right there along with characters that I came to love. But unfortunately that wasn't the case, and it didn't take me long to figure out why.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned that the first two books weren't about a girl and her love life against the backdrop of war, it was actually all about the war and being a part of it. Except, it wasn't. The first two books have a very specific tone and feel to them, and while the upcoming war is a big part of it, the books are all about this girl, and what she goes through as her world undertakes this massive change that she's a big part of.  And the third book veers sharply away from that.<br /><br />To me, this book wasn't about her, or even the characters as a whole, it was an account of war strategy, interspersed with horrific events that leave our main character constantly drugged and/or hospitalized, in pain, emotionally damaged, and even a bit off her rocker at times. And yet you find yourself failing to care. This girl, whose character I couldn't get enough of previously, left me feeling completely indifferent, as I was when terrible things happened to previously beloved characters. That is what truly makes this book a failure to me. Not that it doesn't have the happy ending everyone wanted, or that is was dismal and depressing because of the war, but because I couldn't bring myself to care one whit about what happened to any of these people. There was absolutely none of the charm or emotion of the first two books. The 'girl on fire' had completely lost her spark, and with it, my interest.<br /><br />*SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER* To illustrate this best I'll explain it the way I explained it to my husband. In The Hunger Games, when Katniss volunteered to take Prim's place, I was choked up, literally. I could feel myself in the situation, and I ached for the characters. In Mockingjay, Prim is blown to bits while Katniss watches, and I couldn't care less.
