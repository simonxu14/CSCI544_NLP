I was rather disappointed with the conclusion of the Hunger Games trilogy.  It seems like things were happening TOO Katniss, rather than her taking charge and making things happen.  We are told, not shown.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />I HATED that the author ended up killing Primm.  WTH??? It's rare I get upset at a characters death, but this one really got me.  It seemed so unnecessary after all Katniss went through to keep her safe.<br /><br />I also did not like Gale turned sort of evil.  It seemed like a cop-out plot device to make Katniss choose Peeta.
