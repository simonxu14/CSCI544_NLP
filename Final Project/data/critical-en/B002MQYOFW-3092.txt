I liked the first part of the first book well enough to order the second two so that I could go on reading without interruption. However, by the end of the book I had some regrets about placing the second order.<br />The book is a fast read (sort of like the Maximum Drive series) and was probably a fast write, too:  there's not a lot of depth. By the end of the book I felt somewhat surfeited and not too curious about the next book.  I'll review that too when I've had a chance to read it.
