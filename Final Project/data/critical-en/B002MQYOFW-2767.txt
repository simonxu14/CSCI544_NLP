All of my bibliophilic friends in the blogosphere told me I had to read Hunger Games.  There's a reason I don't read contemporary fiction.  I think there's enough ugliness and drama in the world.  I don't want to read about it too.  So, even though I'm not a fan of Dystopian themes, I picked it up.  I'm still not sure what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />I found the premise appalling.  I know, I know, that's the whole point of Dystopian themes, the shock value.  Still, reading it made me feel uncomfortable (again, I know that's the point), but it made it hard for me to engage with the book. So it's not my genre.  Even if I couldn't appreciate the theme, I strove to appreciate it other ways.<br /><br />However, the plot was rather predictable.  I knew how it was going to end (and not because I was spoiled), it was just a matter of how Suzanne Collins would take the reader from point A to point B. For me, it was straight forward and without surprises.  It was the love story, or pseudo-love story, that finally made the read accessible to me.  Once I found a likable, character, and for me it wasn't Katniss, it did become a somewhat compelling read.  (Although, I think it was more of an 'I want to keep reading so I can be done with it,' than an 'I want to keep reading.') I didn't find Katniss to be a remarkable female character.  Yes, she volunteered to die in place of her sister, but in the end, it was her hunting skills and her comprehension of game theory that saved the day ...and she listened to her advisor.<br /><br />It was well written. Though some of the negative reviews I've seen cast aspersions on Collins' writing style, I don't agree with any of them.  I don't fault the writing, I just don't appreciate the plot.<br /><br />While I will continue to press on in the series, I don't think I'm the target audience.  If I want to read about atrocities, I'll read the non-fiction accounts, not waste my imagination on more horrifying ones.<br /><br />[...]
