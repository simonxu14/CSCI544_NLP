Although this is a hardcover book, it is not the same version as the ones you see in the stores.  It is a smaller version with no dust jacket and looks very cheap.  If you have the rest of the set and want it to match or like to keep books and display them in a library, this would not be the book for you.  I returned it and got a full refund, something that Amazon is very good about.
