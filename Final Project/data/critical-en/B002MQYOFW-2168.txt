So.... I LOVED the first book... The second book... Meh.... It was ok... Still a good read...more hunger games and stuff...love story still kind of good... This one... This one blows... Read it... I mean you have to so you can find out the end... But... Meh... It left me... Flat... And quite frankly.... Not hungry for more....
