I was excited and anxious to read Mockingjay. I preordered it from amazon.com and my copy arrived early last week. I finally finished reading it Saturday night. Which means, that while I did enjoy most of it, I didn't find it as gripping as the first two.<br /><br />What I appreciated most in the first two books was the adrenaline-pumping action of Katniss's adventures of survival during the Games. Mockingjay lacked so much of that. Katniss didn't get into real action until the last third of the book and then just when it was getting good, Katniss and the reader are left incapacitated and in the dark yet again.<br /><br />I didn't mind how the book ended. Really, it was fine. But I felt like the ending was abrupt. There could have been so much more. Ultimately, I was disappointed with Mockingjay. I didn't feel that the finale lived up to the first two books.
