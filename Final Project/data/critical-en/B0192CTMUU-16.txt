I was extremely disappointed with the condition of this book.  I have never purchased a book in such poor condition--this would not even sell at a yard sale for $1, but I paid $10, plus shipping & handling.  It was not listed as in poor condition, so be careful to read the "fine print" and not just the condition.  I failed to do that, but it should never had been listed as in "Good" condition.  The seller responded to my complaint "it is still a good read" (!?).  We had already read the book, but had loaned ours and it had not been returned, so I was just trying to replace it.  But not with one that has been written on, in ink, with no jacket and a broken spine, and filthy pages.
