Doesn't measure up to the first two in the trilogy.  Almost seemed as though it was written because of the success of its predecessors, but with very little substance.  I rarely stop reading mid-book, but I almost  did here . . . many times.  I couldn't wait to finish so I could move on to something more rewarding.  Sorry, Suzanne . . .
