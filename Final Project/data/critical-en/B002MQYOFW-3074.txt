I couldn't help but notice, the idea for this book is very similar to the Japanese film Battle Royale (where children are forced to an island to kill each other off for population control, and the victor gets to return home).  That aside, the book definitely seems to be written for an adolescent audience, but it is still an entertaining read.  I finished it in a day.  I'll probably read the other 2 books in the trilogy, just to see where they take the storyline.<br />Overall:  It's worth spending the roughly $5 and taking an afternoon to read it.  Don't expect to be blown away, but it's entertaining enough.
