The first book in the trilogy was absolutely PERFECT. I couldn't wait for the second book to be published. The second book was good (not perfect) and, once again, i couldn't wait for the big finale. I was waiting for my copy to come in the mail that I had ordered almost a year in advance and started reading it immediately! I just couldn't wait to see Katniss bring down the Capital and President Snow! Will she choose Peeta or Gale? So many questions that were finally going to be answered. WRONG!!!<br /><br />I can't even begin to tell you how disappointed I am with Suzanne Collins. First, you give us this awesome female character with conviction and perseverance, and then you completely deflate her in the end. Shame on you! To think that I was under the impression that Collins was a writer who could show young women to be brave and stand up for what they believe in is embarrasing!!!<br /><br />For those of you (like i was) who are looking forward to seeing Katniss as a great heroine against the Capital, think again. What you will find is a diminished woman who now resembles Haymitch...
