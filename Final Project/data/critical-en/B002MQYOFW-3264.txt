I purchased this book because a couple of my friends were discussing the trilogy and I wanted to see what the fuss was about.  It was an easy read - I think I finished it in a day and a half - but the plot moves somewhat slowly and predictably.  The author isn't particularly gifted.  I was willing to buy the second and third books if I liked the first, but I am definitely going to pass on that opportunity.  I would not recommend.
