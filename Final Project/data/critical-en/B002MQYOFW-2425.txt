I loved the first book, thought the second was good but was very disappointed in MockingJay. Katniss seems like she whines alot and talks about the samething over and over again. I had to finish it because I wanted to know what happened to end the series but I was honestly bored with the progession of the story and repetition by a quarter of the way into the book...it was hard to finish.
