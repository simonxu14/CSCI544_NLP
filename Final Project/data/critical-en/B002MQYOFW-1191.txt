Not quite as bad as the Twilight series, but not much better.  It's 3 books of whiny teenage narrative of wahhhhh &#34;I don't want to do it&#34; &#34;Why me?&#34; &#34;Life's not fair!&#34;  So she's the only person in the districts who can shoot a bow / hunt and that makes her a hero?  Oh, and skip the movies.  It's also almost as painful as the Twilight movies where you wish for your life back.
