I started reading this series out of curiosity and a want to see what other friends had gotten out of it. I gathered a decent amount of interest in the story and the characters and finished the book quickly. It was an easy read and as I had heard wasn't too mentally challenging.<br />Bottom line, it was good enough to keep me interested and is good enough to interest me in reading the other two books.
