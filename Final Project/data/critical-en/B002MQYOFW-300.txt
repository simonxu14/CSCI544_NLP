I had very high hopes for this triology.  I thought for sure that it would knock my socks off considering all the craziness surrounding the book and movie and the fact so many people I knew loved it.  Unfortunately I didn't.  My bf and I both read it and we liked the 1st book, but felt it went downhill after that.  We both had different reasons, so I'll just tell you mine.  I didn't like the idea of kids killing kids (just awful), but I thought for sure there was  something to it and there would be some sort of moral story at the end......  I did not expect the killing to go throughout to the end (I could elaborate here, but I don't want to ruin the books for someone else).  Just had really high hopes.  Saw movie #1 and was not impressed.  Ah well, I'm sure I'll love the next series that is all the rage!
