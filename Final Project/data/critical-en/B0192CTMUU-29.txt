This book gets a 3 from me becuse it seems like a whole bunch of unnecessary things happen just for the sake of who knows what. It's like we get a tiny glimpse of the wizarding world outside of Hogwarts, and then we never hear about it again. We never learn of anything substantial about the other two schools. We don't learn anything about the Salem Witches institute. Why even bring these things up if we never really hear about them?<br /><br />Also, couldn't the fake Mad Eye Moody have turned anything into a Portkey like the first day? Wouldn't that have been way easier than rigging 3 super hard contest? I think this book was just an attempt put in useless action.
