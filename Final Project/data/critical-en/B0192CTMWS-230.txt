The least stars I can give this is one. I'd prefer to give a negative.<br /><br />The whole planet was waiting for this book. JKR knew this, she could have submitted the Edinburgh telephone directory and people would have bought it and declared it 'Wonderful!' 'Exciting!' 'Marvelous!'.<br /><br />Plot holes you could drive the Night Bus through: An extended camping trip, just to fill up space. Why didn't Harry and Hermione simply go muggle? They go into hiding without any cash? Have they never heard of a cashpoint/ATM?<br /><br />Dumbledore give Harry a quest, with minimal information or training. Doesn't he want Harry to suceed?<br /><br />Wands turn out to be critical, but nobody carries a spare wand! Why? They aren't that expensive if the Weasleys can afford them. If 'The wand picks the wizard' then NOBODY could use another person's wand, yet they do.<br /><br />Deaths with no explanation, and no logical reason.<br /><br />The Lexicon asked if the faculty members were married. JKR said she'd answer that 'later'. I'm still waiting.<br /><br />Lupin and Tonks have a baby, and leave Teddy to go fight? That must be a severe case of postpartum depression that Nymphy had! I think she could have been forgiven for not showing up for the final battle.<br /><br />George has a twin brother, and doesn't name his kid after it when he's killed? Shows absolutely NO grief? None of the Weasleys mourn poor Fred?<br /><br />There are NO 'good' Slytherin students? Slytherin is a convenient 'black hat' for JKR, I find it very hard to believe that as soon as a student is sorted for Slytherin, they instantly turn evil.<br /><br />After all the problems Harry's given Voldie, he sends a lackey to check to see if he's really dead? Why not simply slit his throat to make sure? For that matter, Harry has a muggle background, why didn't he simply shoot Voldie? Why fight on your enemy's (magical) terms?<br /><br />The afterword is useless. Why not a 'what happened to...'? JKR did one in an interview later, and I really wonder about some of the pairings.<br /><br />This book is 759 pages. 3-400 pages could have easily been trimmed out, and if the editors were doing their job properly, it would have been a better book. Is JKR paid by the word?
