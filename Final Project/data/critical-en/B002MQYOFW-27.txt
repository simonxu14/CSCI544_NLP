I loved the first two. I anxiously awaited the third. Boy, am I disappointed. Three themes: War is Hell, the danger of our voyeuristic habits, and people will do anything to survive.  These themes are firmly established in the first two books, and then Collins beats you over the head with them in the third.<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert*<br /><br />Peeta<br />We are told he will never be the same, over and over and over and over...and then he his, though how he gets there is never really revealed in any kind of satisfying way. Katniss who emotionally keeps him at arm's length for the first two novels, with a few exceptions, gives up on him completely in the third.  This is understandable given that he wants to kill her.  However, they end up together?! What?!!! Seriously. I want a explanation. Not an interpretation, an explanation. That should have been another chapter in the book. 380 pages of the book is blood bathe, 28 is the recovery there after.  We have been short-changed.  And really, for three books, you still end up asking, what really is in it for him? It is a very one-side relationship.<br /><br />Gale<br />Gale and Katniss are finally together. YAY!  Oh, wait, nothing happens.  He is conveniently turned almost into an antagonistic by a character that admits she has no right to judge anyone, so he can go away and Katniss and Peeta can end up together.  Before this strange character shift, can anyone give me one nonsuperficial way in which Gale and Peeta are different? I like that Collins is very effective at making us unsure who she will pick for the almost the entire three books.  However, it's all resolved in about three pages.<br /><br />Katniss<br />A character that has such strong focus for two novels, here, has none. She is a mess from the beginning and only becomes more psychologically broken, yet manages a near fairy tale ending. In all the excessive violence to teach us WAR IS HELL, Katniss, 17, experiences unspeakable loss and witnesses horrors that can only be imagined. It is interesting how out of her family and closest friends, only one dies. Outside of that circle, and you are doomed. Despite this, she makes close to a full recovery.  The only sign of lingering distress is her delay to have children and the occasional nightmare. Really?  In prison all she wants to do is kill herself. Then she is placed in District 12, among the murdered bodies of thousands, in the home she shared with her now dead sister.  It's here that she begins her recovery. Yep, that makes sense. Really for all the gratuitous violence, it would be a more of a complete ending for her to kill herself or become a crazy blood thirsty killer soldier, forever broken.  This would actually be far more effective in conveying the horror of war.  Instead we have killer human/lizards that tear people to pieces and eats victims alive and a teenage murderer/soldier that lives happily ever after. Short-Changed.<br /><br />Here lies the problem.  Collins wants to lecture us about war without having any real experience with it.  Read All is Quiet on the Western Front. Real violence, less violence, much more effective. Or 1984, or...anything.<br /><br />Obviously, I could go on, but I think I have made my main points.<br /><br />Sigh, Collins should have been given another year to write this book.  I would have happily waited.<br /><br />Btw, Mad Annie is now a single mother? Anyone else disturbed by this fact?
