The books themselves are quite poor.<br /><br />Let me explain. When I first heard about this series, I was told that it was good, riveting etc. I had rather high expectations for the books. Coming from a background where Harry Potter, The Chronicles of Narnia, Lord of the Rings, the Chronicles of Prydain, Redwall etc, are considered good, riveting, well written,  etc., I think I was hoping to be able to add this trilogy to my collection.<br /><br />No dice however. Do not be fooled by the media reviews or Stephen King's praise for the first book only: this series is terrible. King hit the nail on the head when he said that the story of the first book is captivating. You will likely enjoy the story of the first book. I did, despite frequent proofreading mistakes, terrible sentence construction, and an overall reading level of 6th grade. So I pressed onwards to the second book of the trilogy.<br /><br />It only got worse. The plot goes to the pits very quickly and the whole thing devolves into a repetitive love triangle/teen angst exercise. Painful, tedious and near the end of the second book, the whole narrative unravels and just loses all sense of cohesion. The level of suspension of disbelief goes through the roof. Similar problems with the last book persist in this book (spelling, grammar, etc.)<br /><br />The last book is just as poor, nonsensical and boring.<br /><br />You want pros? Okay: the books themselves all well bound, have easy to read fonts and have nice dust jackets. That is all.<br /><br />The movie ended up being a step above (or maybe a mile) these books. Do yourself a favor and skip these books unless you are a hard core fan and just want some shiny books with no real concern about what is inside.
