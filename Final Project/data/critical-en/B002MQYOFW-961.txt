Disturbing storyline, done in a tasteful, fairly non-violent, page turning way. It is a cross between The Truman Show, Survivor, Mad Max and Margaret Haddix's The Shadow Children series. Wierd, I know- but it works. Middle school girls who like fantasy will be hooked. I didn't think I'd like it when I heard the premise, but as a bookseller who has seen it flying off the shelves, I had to read it, and wasn't disappointed. If you liked this, read Margaret Haddix's "Running Out of Time" and Shadow Children series.
