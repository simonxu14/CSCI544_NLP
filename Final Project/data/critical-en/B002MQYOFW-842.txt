I don't know what I expected. I guess Katniss to rise above, lead the revolution, save everyone, live happily ever after. Sorry, if it's a spoiler, but that isn't how this story ends. This story is like reading a real, gut wrenching war. This is what revolutions are actually like. Some people you love will die. The people who live will be so physically and mentally destroyed they will never be the same again. It isn't remotely easy. Choices are tough. Sometimes you don't know if you are doing the right thing. Neither side is all good or all bad. Some people repeat history's mistakes again. It is clear Suzanne Collins is incredibly talented. The story makes logical sense. It isn't a fairy tale. It is real raw human emotion. People breaking down. People losing everything, just like real war, and like war the story eventually ends. Everything has changed, even the people, especially the people.
