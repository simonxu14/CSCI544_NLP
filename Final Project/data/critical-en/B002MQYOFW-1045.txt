The sequel did not provide the edge-of-your-seat interest that I found in the first installment.  I will read the third volume because I am hoping that it will have a more interesting story.  The brutality of the arena no longer surprised, so there should have been less of it.  This book just seemed like the author capitalizing on the original interest of the readers, and was merely a filler between the first and third book, thus providing the author with more book sales.
