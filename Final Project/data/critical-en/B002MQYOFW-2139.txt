I guess this was just a big letdown. Everyone at work was reading it, and after finishing up all five of the the George R.R. Martin books, I picked up these and read them in a weekend. Lesson - Suzanne Collins can write for teens and those who enjoy a quick and light read - each of the three books was engaging yet lacking in real character development, pace or depth. The last quarter of the Mockingjay is a rambling mess of wrap up if there ever was one- it read like an early Grisham novel without the punchline.<br /><br />If you like light, easy and not too developed- you will love this. If you want something that appeals to a young audience buy it, but if you want to read something that might capture you, and peak your interest, and truly make you think about the character - try Tolkien, Rowling, Lewis, or even Martin. Don't let anyone tell you Suzanne Collins is the next JK Rowling, if they do, unfriend them on Facebook as fast as you can....
