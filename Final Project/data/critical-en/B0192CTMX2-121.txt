JK Rowling became very wealthy very quickly and you can tell that she didn't think this book through. It's a little interesting but not as exciting as her other books. She attempted to be clever having the main characters not attend Hogwarts but at the end it's very obvious this story line was not planned well and she must've needed to prematurely cut story lines short in order to meet Scholastic's deadlines. There is no solid explanation of why Harry survives. Generally, she's good at making solid explanations. She's still rich though so she might write something good again eventually.
