Maybe it's me, but reading the third book in the Hunger Games trilogy just got old for me.  I got tired of Katniss and her teenaged angst amidst so much more.  I no longer believed she could lead anyone, not even with stylists and p.r. people guiding her.  I finished the book, but I think the story had outlived its interest for me.  Of course, I am not a teenager or even a twenty-something, so maybe I was expecting more.
