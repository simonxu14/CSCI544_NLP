I knew this was a children's book when I bought it, but it's so popular, I expected something smarter.  I also thought it was targeted at teenagers but the reading level is actually third or fourth grade.  Even though it has fewer made up places and ideas than adult dystopian novels, it was still a chore to get through because it was just words on a page, nothing came to life.  I suppose the children who read it have richer imaginations than me and are able to project themselves into the story.<br /><br />So--I bought it, I read it and now I know I wasn't missing a thing!
