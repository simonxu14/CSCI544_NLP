Harry dies except he doesn't die.  When Gandalf died, he was reincarnated by Iluvatar.  There's no clue as to how Harry was dead enough to be rid of the horcrux part of himself and yet he sort of wakes up as if he was stunned.  None the less, Lord Thingy is like Wile E. Coyote and he absolutely insists on yet another duel with Harry.  How many failed attempts has he made?  How many times has his death curse bounced off Harry and killed him instead?  Maybe the original attempt to kill baby Harry left Lord Thingy with brain damage.
