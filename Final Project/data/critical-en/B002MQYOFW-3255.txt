I just finished the series and it is terrible. The first book is dark but entertaining, but the rest of the series fails to redeem itself.  The author creates a typical dystopia, adds a gladiatorial arena with children in it, and then drags this concept out through three poorly written books to see how badly she can mess with her characters, and disappoint her readers. Do not waste your time reading this series, and don't reward this author for writing junk like this.
