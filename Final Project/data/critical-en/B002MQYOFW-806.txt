The Hunger Games Trilogy is an interesting book - that's pretty much it.<br /><br />The plot is predictable, there is almost no character development and the writing leaves a lot to ask for. I don't get why so many people seem to be in love with it. Even though the plot idea is a good one, it could have been developed so much better. I would much rather about the main character struggles with her life and how she delas with them rather than her latest crush or her fights in the Games. The character however remains constant throughout. All characters are amazingly one-dimensional.<br /><br />Then again, this book is targeted to young adults...
