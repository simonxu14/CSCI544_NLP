I read the first two novels in this series with glee and appreciation. The author demonstrated both talent and skill, and her technique was exemplary.<br /><br />Mockingjay, however, is a failure and it is a failure on so many levels. Writers take their readers on emotional roller coasters all the time and readers usually enjoy the ride. Unfortunately, the Mockingjay roller coaster crashes and burns with its grotesque plodding from misery to misery. Katniss merely reacts, when she's not either sedated or wallowing in pain, and there is certainly no further development of her from the first two novels. The hodgepodge of scenes and contrived and pointless deaths of Finnick and Prim feel disjointed and unfocused, a blur of deaths among many until we finally reach an ending of sorts - a scrap of epilogue thrown to readers, almost as an afterthought, that offers no redemption or closure, little healing, and less hope for the emotionally dead Katniss.<br /><br />If I'm going to ride an author's roller coaster, I want to be entertained, enlivened, exhilarated, not lectured and pummeled with unrelenting misery messages.  One can only speculate about the author's motives. If it was her intent to create a dismal, depressing work and pointless ending suitable for the effete, she has succeeded. I, for one, will never read anything else she writes, because I don't trust her anymore.
