I found the plot very interesting and the hidden psychology of post war victims quite thought provoking, however, the poor grammar made the reading a bit difficult. It interfered with the flow of the story. Either the writer was a genius, and wrote it as a poorly educated teen or the publisher and editor of this book should be fired.
