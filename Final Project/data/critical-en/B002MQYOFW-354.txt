There are many other reviews that eloquently explain why they only gave this book 1 measly little star.  I won't attempt to repeat what others have said about the lack of character development, depressing and rushed ending, or the barrage of endless murders...except to say that I agree with them 100%.  I loved the first book and most of the 2nd, but the author lost me the moment the arrow went through the chink (end of book 2).  From that point forward, the main character became a confused and manipulated pawn who lost her ferocity and her morals.  She's a hot mess and who wants to read about THAT?
