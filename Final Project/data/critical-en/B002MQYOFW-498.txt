There was something about this book which didn't grab me as wholeheartedly as the others in the series. I think that Collins introduces too many characters to follow thus making it harder to keep an emotional bond with each. There were times when I had to search earlier parts to make sure I wasn't confusing any of them.  On top of that, while I felt like the other two books had plot twists which I didn't see coming, there weren't any in this which I felt had the same impact.<br /><br />Outside of that, it retained her typical style of blending action against Katniss' emotional journey - which still worked well.<br /><br />Honestly, if this was an individual story I would've probably given this book 4 stars but I feel it's more than just a small step down from the previous two.  It was a good ending to The Hunger Games saga, even if the end wrapped up a little too nicely for my taste.
