Very good book i admit, just that i think that its not at the same level as volume 1 or 2. Should definitely get it in order to complete the series or else you'll just be left wondering what is going on. The book itself came in perfect condition and came fast enough. high recommend, just subtracted 2 stars cause i didn't like the way the story played out.
