Rather ordinary story line with the author losing control and having to go to book 1, book 2, book 3, etc. (likely with pressure from a today's juvenile, sales minded publisher pushing hard) trying to find an ending of some kind, somewhere short of reader total disinterest.  Sorry Ms Collins, it might be better to write several books each book complete onto itself.  IMO, writer and reader will benefit...steamboat
