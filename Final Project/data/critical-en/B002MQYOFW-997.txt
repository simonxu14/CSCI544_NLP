This book, while keeping the reader's interest, does little in the way making it a memorable finale. I fact, it feels like the latter half of the book all ha opened too quickly, with glaring details being lefts unaddressed. For its target audience, this probably won't matter, but for mor experienced readers, this will leave you wanting.<br /><br />Read if you've read the last couple of books, but this is by no means a masterpiece.
