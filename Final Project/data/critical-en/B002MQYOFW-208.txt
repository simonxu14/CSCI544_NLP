Not sure what Collins was thinking when she wrote this final book but Catnis turns into the weakest character possible.  I can't imagine a worse way to end the series than the rushed and torn way this final book played out.  I read the first two books in a week.  This last one was a struggle and epic failure.  It was written too fast.  Shame on the publisher for not pushing Collins to write a stronger version of the finish.  It felt so forced/rushed to the end.  And the reader can't even sympathize with the deranged characters who basically stumble through the book in delusional stupors.  Pretty awful.  I can only hope the movie fixes the books mistakes.
