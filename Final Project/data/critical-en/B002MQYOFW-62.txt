After reading the first two books, I had such high expectations of Mockingjay. Hunger Games was great and Catching Fire was awesome! I felt Collins writing was so unique and breathtaking, only to be disappointed by Mockingjay. Its like the characters were stripped from the things that made you fall in love with them in the first place. I'm not sure of what Collins was thinking but she could have brought on a War without such disappointments in the characters. Honestly, I only kept reading with hopes that the book would get better! Unfortunately, it never reached the heights of talent Collins has proven in the past.
