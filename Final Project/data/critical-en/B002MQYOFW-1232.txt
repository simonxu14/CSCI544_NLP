I enjoyed the first two novels (borrowed from the library) enough that I chose to purchase the third book. However, while it was still moderately entertaining, MockingJay had very little plot. It is one of those books that seem to just expand a 2-dimensional single sentence storyline into a book, with seemingly no reason.<br /><br />I feel that one should NEVER pause in the middle of a book and wonder how nothing has really happened for the past 150 pages. Even worse, I stopped in the middle of this book and realized I didn't feel any inclination to finish the book. I could have dropped it right then and there without losing a wink of sleep.<br /><br />That said, I did finish the book if only to find some sort of closure. However, even that eludes the reader in this book. There really was no climax, book 2 was the climax. This entire book just seemed to make its dying cry without adding much, if anything to the trilogy.<br /><br />*MINOR SPOILERS*<br />No characters or character relationships were developed--the love triangle with gale, peeta, and kat goes nowhere. The previous books actually made me *feel* something while reading them, this one was just... dead, dead like the "horrors of war" it seemed to be trying to convey. Fiction novels, especially the ending book to a trilogy, should not be war documentaries. I just witnessed a lot of gore and random characters dying. There were some surprises, but those felt like loose threads, and didn't really fit into the tapestry of the story.<br /><br />I commend Collins for her first two books, but feel she should have perhaps taken an extra year to work on this one rather then rush out a painfully mediocre read.
