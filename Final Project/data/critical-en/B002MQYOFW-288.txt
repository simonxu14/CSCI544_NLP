When I was a young woman, when I loved the Greek tragedies, and when I read all the must-reads of my generation, I might have liked this book, and this series a little more. I remember my mother's telling me that she'd experienced too much of the realities of life to find stories like these entertainment, that she needed things to make her laugh. That's how I feel, especially after reading this last book in this series. I, like my mother, have seen too such of the kind of  atrocities that human beings can inflict on each other to find this other than horrifying. There is no escapism in this. There is only a sense of numbing horror. This is not a book I'm glad I've read, however well written it might be. This is a horror story.
