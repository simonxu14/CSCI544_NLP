I liked the hunger games books, they reminded me of a mix of "the long walk" and "the running man," two Stephen King short stories. However, I think because of the violence they are just not suitable for the intended target of teenagers.<br /><br />The main character is kind of droll, and there is very little character building or reason to like her, I believe. However the concept of the books and story line is what makes them page turners.<br /><br />This book, the final in the series, I felt leaves you wanting more. It feels like the author quickly wrote this in an effort to get it published, leaving the reader to fill in the holes.<br /><br />All in all I'd say its decent in its conception, but not something I'd want to read again.
