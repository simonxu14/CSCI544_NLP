Unlike many readers of this series, I did not read these books as a child. I was already an adult when I started the series in 2001 -- yet being a writer myself, I admired enormously JK Rowling's storytelling ability and the charm of the amazing world she created. In fact, I think being a writer gives one even greater opportunity to appreciate her remarkable craft.<br /><br />Having said that, and having especially enjoyed her recounting of Harry's adventures at Hogwarts, I found Book 7 a distinct disappointment -- for in this book alone, Harry does NOT return to Hogwarts as a student.<br /><br />The basic structure of the other six books -- his coming to Hogwarts in the fall, his classes and  encounters with Hogwarts teachers, the social side of his school life, etc. -- formed the basis for each book. Not to have it -- to have instead a long, meandering account of his year spent mostly on the run -- forces the series into a completely different structure, one which really does not work.<br /><br />At 759 pages, the novel is way overlong -- I can only assume author and publisher felt it had to be, to give fans their money's worth. The description of various places alone could have been cut to the bone without losing a thing -- and made the book fifty pages shorter. I also found plenty of repetition in the things Harry was finding or the encounters he was having with various baddies. It didn't add to our understanding and was just more stuff to wade through.<br /><br />Did it go fast? Sure it did. Though I think Rowling's phrasing could be more succinct, I still read the whole book in about 14 hours. But as a reader, I was disappointed that her emotional moments (and there were several), which could have been milked for several pages, were quick and dry, and the place descriptions, which bored me to tears and added nothing to the plot, were drawn out ridiculously long. The through line, which from Book Six was the finding of Horcruxes, became both the Horcruxes and the Deathly Hallows halfway through Book 7. The minute that happened, it split our attention -- which is never a good thing in an onrushing narrative.<br /><br />Other drawbacks? I hated Hermione's crying all the time -- she's never been a crybaby before, but suddenly she's leaking tears everywhere in this book. I hated the moment Rowling chose to give us a Ron & Hermione love scene -- come on, Ms. Rowling -- NOBODY goes around snogging in the middle of a battle!<br /><br />I think Harry's character in this book (and yeah, I know he's been through a lot, but still, he's our HERO) was more high-strung, impatient and tougher to like than ever, which led to his problems with Ron, among other people. It was distracting and annoying. And unlike other readers, who claim ALL the characters re-appear in this book, I noticed that two characters (one from Books Two and Book Five, the other from Books Two and Four) didn't appear once in this book, and I would have loved to see them, since we were wrapping it up anyway ...<br /><br />I too disliked the epilogue -- but mostly because there wasn't a single surprise in it. And having had two years to think about it, I was pretty sure I knew some of the backstory we hadn't gotten yet -- sure enough, what Harry discovers in this book pretty much confirms what I had thought. Given how brilliantly she carried the series off up to this point, I felt let down that I had figured it out.<br /><br />I also think the editing could have been much sharper -- Rowling's storytelling genius is no less brilliant, and personally I think it is enhanced, if the deadwood is cut away. But one of the things we look forward to in every book is the endless invention she gives us, which shows us how her magical world works. There was simply none of that in this book, I thought the additional burden of the Hallows was completely unnecessary and sidetracked the main plot, and the complex hoops she was jumping through regarding Harry and Voldemort's inevitable final confrontation, to set up her thesis for us, was a big yawn for me.<br /><br />In sum, I'm glad I read this -- but it's not even close to being one of my favorites. For sheer inventiveness, SORCERER'S STONE is unmatched, while for character and relationships I love CHAMBER OF SECRETS, GOBLET OF FIRE and HALF-BLOOD PRINCE. And perhaps, for those of us who are grousing about the series, it simply was impossible for Rowling to satisfy us -- things she set up previously could only turn out so many ways, and perhaps if we guessed her choice, it's only because she was so good at drawing us into her world after all.<br /><br />I wouldn't have missed meeting Harry, Ron, Hermione, Gilderoy Lockhart, Fred & George Weasley, Dolores Umbridge or the others for anything. So thanks, Ms. Rowling, for a long and glorious immersion in a grand adventure. While I may not re-read DEATHLY HALLOWS too often, I can promise that I'll be revisiting your world regularly -- and I'm grateful for the gift.
