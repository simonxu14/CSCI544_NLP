I think this going to make a better movie than it did a book, and I've never had that thought before. This was a great draft of a book that could have been very good, but these charactors lack depth. I don't understand how his is getting so many five star ratings. I didn't hate it, but it I just didn't feel any suspense or high emotion, especially considering the gravity of the situation Katniss was in. A lot of untapped potential here. Decent story, bad writing.
