The book had four pages that look like the photos attached and other pages in horrible condition. This was very disappointing. This was a gift for our 9yr old niece. I told her I will get her a new book but she was so excited to get the book she wanted to keep it. I am buying her another one. I also ordered a hardcover and received a paperback. DO NOT BUY !!!!
