I wanted so much more of this book and was completely let down.  I won't spoil anything but I guess I just wanted the superhero ending or the fantasic revenge is the best medicine ending or even the one that makes no sense at all but would have simply been karmic justice.  Instead I feel I got just another dose of bitter reality.  Not what drew me into this series and what kept me reaking the whole series over the course of a week. I guess I'll have to finally read the last "Harry Potter".  I've been putting it off for years but now I need a perfectly complete ending as I am still disappointed about what Susan Collins wrote for Katniss and Peeta and Gail.
