Felt a bit like the author was burnt out and had to force herself to finish this trilogy, or else someone not as good wrote this final book. Jars against the first two which were excellent. Some parts were very good but most was tedious. Readers of the previous two books should definitely complete the series but be prepared to be rather disappointed with this weak ending to an otherwise exceptional story.
