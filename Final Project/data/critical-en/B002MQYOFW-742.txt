I saw the movie, "Hunger Game," before I read the three books. I<br />thought the movie did a good job, and followed the first books<br />well with, of course, a lack of depth.  As I was impressed with<br />the story in the movie, I decided to read the books.<br /><br />The one review I read spoiled a bit of the second book for me, so<br />I'll try not to do the same to you.<br /><br />The author hits you with many twists and turns.  Some sharp<br />corners. I love to predict, and I admit I did not do a good job<br />of predicting while reading these books; though I had a couple of<br />"right-on" guesses at the end. Still, I think those sharp corners<br />may catch you up and make you jerk. So, I give the series high<br />marks for keeping the story going. It makes you want to keep<br />reading.<br /><br />One of the things I found very interesting was the author's<br />absolute dedication to first person.  If Katniss doesn't know it<br />-- you don't know it.  If she's not there, neither are you.  You<br />are never let in on any side story or private conversations that<br />Katniss isn't told about or doesn't hear.  Though I can't say<br />that Katniss' view of what's going on is always right.  She<br />certainly works at it -- in her own paranoid way.<br /><br />The politics are interesting.  I enjoyed the interwoven politics.<br />Personally, I think the author takes a bit of literary license in<br />the contrived 13 districts.  I don't believe the politics could<br />exist. And there I fall into my own trap -- I want a little more<br />reality.  I love SciFi. I grant literary license in liberal<br />doses; but this... I don't know.  I couldn't accept the District<br />concept.  And, what happened to the rest of the world?  Unknown,<br />unmentioned -- not considered and not part of the story.  Why<br />should I even be concerned? I accept that.<br /><br />I like my SciFi science to blend.  The Capitol could do so many<br />things, and yet could not do others.  Mutts!  I hated the larger<br />Mutts.  The wasps and birds were ok -- the story used them both<br />well. But the others? I couldn't reconcile them with the science.<br />Sure, they added some adventure; but, the extended science wasn't<br />there.  If the Capitol could handle genetics that well, they<br />should have been able to do so much more. The science wasn't<br />"blended."  And... don't try and tell me this wasn't SciFi!<br /><br />As for Katniss' mental state (and other character's too), I just<br />can not accept that they would get so messed up.  I can't say too<br />much --it would spoil things; but come on!  Katniss was STRONG.<br />Then why so weak?  I loved her strength and hated her weakness.<br />Her strong side was a well painted and believable character.  But<br />her weak side (and others), as often as it appeared...<br />unacceptable (to me).<br /><br />So in the end, I only give it 3 stars out of 5.  I read it<br />straight through, took little time off.  Wanted to get back to<br />it.  Was thoroughly entertained.  Got my money's worth.  I'm even<br />looking forward to the continued movie series.  But it's not<br />going high on my list of books that I've read.  I think I'll keep<br />the Anne McCaffrays Dragons of Pern series in my head long after<br />I have forgotten The Hunger Games. Treat this trilogy as<br />entertainment -- for that is exactly what it is.  (All this hard<br />hitting social commentary stuff... nope!)
