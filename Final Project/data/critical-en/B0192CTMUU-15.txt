Having thoroughly enjoyed reading the first three books with my 11 year old son, the fourth book is a disappointment. It took 200 pages for the first exciting plot twist to develop (when Harry is mysteriously entered  into the championship contest). The puzzles and clever foreshadowing that  marked the earlier books seem to have gotten lost. The final 100 pages of  the book includes a number of extended monologues which have the main  characters directly explaining how the plot makes sense rather than the  much more interesting manner of the earlier books in which the pieces fall  into place with only a few choice revelations towards the conclusion. At  700+ pages, I truly hope this series following sticks with it for what I  hope will be a fifth book much more in keeping with the first three.
