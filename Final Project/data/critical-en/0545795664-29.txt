Though my boys love this book and enjoy looking at all of the pictures of the different Pok&eacute;mon, the binding of the book is terrible. I got this book for my oldest for his birthday, he opened it last night and already pages are falling out. I'm going to have a figure out a new way to keep the book together, because tape doesn't seem like it will work for every page.
