I wanted to love "The Hunger Games," but I liked it instead. It is a life-or-death plot--that's for sure, and Collins strives for drama and suspense by the overuse of sentence fragments. However, I am aware that she is aiming this novel at a younger audience, while I am a senior citizen!<br /><br />The storyline is brutal. It is about a teenager who is forced to compete in one-person-leaves-alive event. The main character, Katniss, survives through her skills and uses these same skills to feed her family. I won't spoil this novel by saying too much.<br /><br />Still, in spite of my minor criticisms, and a few letdowns, this is and interesting read. I tip my hat to Suzanne Collins--she engages her target audience, and that's what writing fiction is all about.
