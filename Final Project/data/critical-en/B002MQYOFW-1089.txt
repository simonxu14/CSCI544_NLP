It's the last installment of the trilogy so naturally it is filled with the answers to all our questions. The action is different from the first two books and there is a sense that literally everything was crammed into the very end. The writing is poor making this only okay. For a series with so much potential, I'm left feeling as thought I read the first draft rather than the final, polished version.
