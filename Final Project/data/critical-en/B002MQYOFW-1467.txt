My twelve year old grandson had read "The Hunger Games" and really enjoyed it. He recommended the book to me. I read it and did enjoy it, but the violence protrayed in the story is pretty intense. I enjoyed it because I thought Collins was very  imaginative and describes a post World War United States that engages the reader through its use of gladitorial contests.  I then went on to read "Catching Fire" which I enjoyed but not as much as the first. I  then bought and read "Mocking Jay."  I became more disappointed as I read, because as the violence increased, the main characters became more callous toward death. In one sequence, Katniss kills a woman from the Capitol who she came upon and startled. The woman is eating a sausage at the time, and as she looks wide eyed at Katniss with grease on her cheeks, Katniss simply mows her down and then doesn't show a morsel of morose or concern. This book is intended for young adults? To me it sends the wrong message. The ending is very bleak, nothing has changed even though the rebels have taken over. My daughter won't let my grandson read Mocking Jay and I agree with her. Another problem is that I would use creative to describe "The Hunger Games" and "Catching Fire", but would label Collins last book simply more of the same so by the end you become completely jaded.
