At some point during Star Wars, Luke Skywalker's story evolves from his individual quest and struggle to being part of the Revolution as he dons a pilot's uniform and joins a squadron of star fighters battling The Empire.  It works.<br /><br />In Mocking Jay, Katniss Everdeen battles not in an Arena for her individual life, but joins the Rebel Army in District 13, first as a rally-symbol (the Mockingjay) and later as infantry when the rebels make their final assault on the Capital of Panem.  It doesn't work as well.<br /><br />The author was better at portraying the individual combat in the Arenas in the first two books than she was at fitting Katniss into a larger enterprise.  I thought the battle scenes were not as clear in my mind in this book as the very engrossing pictures she painted of the individual contest zones in Books 1 and 2.  The Rebel headquarters seemed awfully small, as did the population, for it to be successful in battling President Snow's army and rallying the other districts to an uprising.  It just didn't work as well for me.<br /><br />Not that this book isn't interesting and worth the time.  If you enjoyed Books 1 and 2, this is fairly enjoyable and carries forward the themes of what freedom means as well as the relationship between the individual and the state.  The love triangle is also brought to a conclusion and loose ends are tied up and resolved.  Readers are introduced to a heretofore unknown District 13 population that has checkmated the Capital since the revolt seventy years before.  Hidden from the rest of the country, Katniss' rebelliousness and connection with the oppressed citizens of Panem as a result of her success in the Hunger Games sparks an uprising that allows the District 13 forces to literally come out of their holes and fan the flames of a budding uprising.<br /><br />Katniss is largely a spectator to that process in the first part of the book.  Anointed the Mockingjay, she is used as a propaganda symbol to rally rebels to the cause.  She continues to struggle with Gale and Peeta and what each means to her as well as her place in her new world for most of this book.<br /><br />While the book is entertaining in parts, there is much less action (save for the final chapters) and more pondering than in the first two parts of the series.  Still, the author does successfully broaden the themes that span her first two efforts and conclude the story with surprises and plot turns that do make it overall a satisfying experience.
