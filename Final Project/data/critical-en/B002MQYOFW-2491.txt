I just got a Kindle for my birthday and started loading up on books that were high on the NY Times Bestseller list as well as the Kindle top-sellers.  I guess some lessons have to be learned the hard way - just because it's a top seller doesn't mean it's good.  The description had me enthralled, but there is very little actual violence.  It is in fact a love story cleverly disguised as an action novel.  Brutal it is not.  I kept waiting for an exciting climax, but one never came.  Just the words "END OF BOOK ONE".<br /><br />To be fair, Suzanne Collins does have a way with words.  Despite my grumblings on plot I found it nearly impossible to put the book down.  The setting was well drawn out and you really did feel like you were "there".  From District 12, to the Capitol to the Arena where the games were held I felt like I was a spectator to the Hunger Games myself.<br /><br />I just hope book 2 is better! (which I will be purchasing)
