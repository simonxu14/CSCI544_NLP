I was very disappointed in this book.  I loved the first 6.  I came to the series late, after all the books had been written. So I read them one after the other...none of that pesky waiting for years in between volumes.<br /><br />Hallows is slow, repetitive and half baked for so many of the reasons that other reviewrs have pointed out, so I won't repeat them here.  This was the weakest and worst of the series.
