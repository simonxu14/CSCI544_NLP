What do I think of this book..hmmmm. let's see. I was on Chaz Bono's blog and he said that this book was really good. Yeah, right. It didn't make any sense. It wad nothing like 'The Help'. I don't even know why anyone would like it. I'm "hungry" for more action. Quit playing "games" with me. The Left Behind series smokes this book series majorly. Note to reader: don't take book recommendations from Chaz Bono unless you want a book that sucks.
