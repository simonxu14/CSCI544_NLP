No spoilers! Cross my heart!<br />I am apprehensive about writing this review. This will be my third attempt at creating a review in which isn't angry word vomit in which I have thrust unto an unsuspecting Amazon buyer. However, I have some things that I feel said buyer might want to know before they subject themselves to this absolutely horrible book.<br /><br />The first thing that irks me is that fact that this book is for young adults. Suzanne Collins gave the series, what I find to be a very dark and disturbing premise in which I find to be borderline, unsuitable for the age group in which this series was directed. My fear is that Collins also realized this and attempted to dull down the gritty horrors, which would have made this last book amazing. Yet, she couldn't take all of the death away, that just wouldn't be fair would it? No. Collins then proceeded to slaughter characters for no specific reason. If somebody is going to die (no saying who) the author must provide a sufficient explanation of both how they died and the aftermath of their passing. I do not appreciate a character that had good character development being killed off and then everybody being like "Well ______ is dead, oh well! Let's keep going."  Not okay folks! I was livid to say the least.  Then there was a little problem that the two main characters, Katniss and Peeta, were both incoherent throughout 99% of this book. I'm sorry but isn't the entire reason the reader has continued to read this series is to find out what happens to Katniss and Peeta? If I'm mistaken I would love to hear why you are rejecting reality. Add to that a horrendous, anticlimactic plot and the fact that the Katniss, Gale, Peeta love triangle was resolved in the epilogue is unacceptable!<br /><br />Much like stopping Marley and Me before the dog dies because we all know what's going to happen, turn away now, remember the love you felt for the other two books, for this book is the metaphorical death of the Hunger Games.
