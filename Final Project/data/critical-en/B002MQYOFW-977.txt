I enjoyed reading this trilogy.  it was intense at times and a little romantic.  I had a strong feeling of where the books were going by the end, but I was a little surprised by one of the ending incidents.  Over all it was a fairly quick read and held my attention.  I also like books that make you think about the issues it brought up even after I have finished the series.
