I get that Collins was probably trying to make a point that war is bad and in many ways, pointless, but when I read a book, it's ALL about the characters I fall in love with. That said, the 'girl on fire' fizzled out (yes, I get that she was abused and exhausted) and ended on a whimper. In fact the end hobbled along instead of with Katniss doing what needed to be done, as always.<br /><br />She should've gone out with  ablaze of glory--even tho that might be unreal in life, it would've wrapped up the book satisfactorily.<br /><br />She should've ended up with Gale. He was her choice. Peeta, while his love was genuine and self-sacrificing--it wasn't asked for, it was foisted on her via the games. And Katniss's last words are about games, so in some ways, that doesn't change. Snow wanted to be convinced of the love between she and Peeta. Did he get what he wanted? Seems like it.<br /><br />Yes, Gale became hardened with a ruthless streak, and yes, he designed the bomb that killed Prim BUT Katniss's fire would've brought him back over time. Her fire should've remained and they would've been so tight, so complete with each other. He took himself out of the love triangle when he realized she would always equate him with Prim's death, and she let him go. I was on Team Gale from moment one.<br /><br />A couple of other points: Katniss killing Coin was brilliant (and gave us the reason why Katniss said yes to more games), but she should've gone from strength to strength, not wasted away for weeks in and out of consciousness only to have everything done when she came to.<br /><br />Finnick deserved more of a eulogy--more of a tribute (if you will). He was a supreme favorite of every reader I know. His death felt insignificant. Especially when I could tell Collins was setting Peeta up to be the one with Katniss at the end, Finnick and Anne's love became THE romance in the book that I was rooting for, because their love was pure, without outside manipulation.<br /><br />All in all the books were well-written and exciting but I feel the author decided to end on a homily about war instead of allowing the character arcs to complete in the way that was the best for all involved.
