The third book of the series did not capture my interest as did books 1 and 2. My son argues that Mockingjay is mostly falling action to create the ending and didn't require the action that the first books needed.  I got the same feeling I had with the last Harry Potter Book movie Harry potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1.  However, there where still moments in Mockingjay that I didn't expect and was pleasantly surprised.
