The book was something of a disappointment.  There are<br />many bells & whistles near the beginning indicating that<br />something great is going to happen, but at the end it is<br />not a great event.<br />Fred & George Weasley's humour is perhaps the best part<br />of the book.  Zacharias Smith also intrigued me, but<br />Rowling apparently forgot he was there after a few<br />chapters.<br />Professor Umbridge is funny and (nastily) interesting.<br />But the real conflict is not between Harry & Voldemort,<br />but between Harry's friends who know Voldemort is a real<br />threat, and the corrupt and incompetent politicians in<br />the Ministry of Magic who want to deny that, because it<br />might upset their own comfortable applecart.<br />I don't think JKR was quite in control of her own<br />materials for some part of this book; perhaps too much<br />fame too soon, or maybe the story I heard about dis-<br />covering a character who shouldn't be there yet and<br />having to revise the book from the beginning.  (Not sure<br />if that's a true rumor, but I heard it.)<br />Anyway, I hope books 6 & 7 will be better.  In my opinion,<br />books 3 (Prisoner of Azkaban) & 4 (Goblet of Fire) are<br />the best in the series so far.  Also, I love the charac-<br />ters, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, Hagrid, McGonagall,<br />etc.  I wonder what the books would be like if they<br />hadn't achieved so much fame so early on?  I suspect they<br />would all 7 be published by now, and they might be a bit<br />shorter.<br />Anyway, all good wishes to J.K. Rowling.  Is she perhaps<br />just a bit similar to Sybill Trelawney?
