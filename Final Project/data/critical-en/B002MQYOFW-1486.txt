I'm with all the other readers here. It was a HUGE disappointment.  I was really hoping for some resolution to Katniss' feelings between Gale and Peeta especially after Peeta was taken by the Capital. This didn't happen at all. Instead Suzanne Collins decided to show us what a little PTSD really does to people, which was horrible. There was NO resolution to any of the previous story lines, especially the romantic ones. If she had had Peeta and Katniss have any interaction that seemed remotely touching this book would have been worlds better, instead she shows us what love can twist into in the middle of war. There were also many pointless deaths. It's like she decided to take out every secondary character that you may have had any attachment to and kill them all so she could keep her dead main characters, even though they didn't do ANYTHING.  I felt really depressed after this book, there were no happy endings, no resolution, and no attachment.  What a disappointment.
