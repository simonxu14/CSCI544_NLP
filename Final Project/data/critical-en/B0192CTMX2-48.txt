I chose this rating because I was unhappy with my purchase.  The seller portrayed this book as shown..with dust jacket and in like new condition.  It arrived without the dusk jacket, and had staining on the cover.  I contacted the seller about this, and she basically told me that I should be happy I got it for so cheap, and that she doesn't make much money selling on Amazon due to all of the fees.  I read a few bad reviews like this of the sellers prior to buying, but still went through with it.  I guess I learned my lesson and vow to heed any negative feedback in the future.  If my daughter hadn't wanted the book so badly, and it wasn't such a bargain, I would thought it through better.  I just wish it had been portrayed properly.  Do not recommend.
