It was exciting and I was very happy to have some resolution. But I was getting a little bored with "Katniss passes out and something incredible happens and she wakes up and gets the full account of all the action we missed." I lost count of how many times it happened in just this book, but having just read the first two within the past few weeks, it got old...quickly.
