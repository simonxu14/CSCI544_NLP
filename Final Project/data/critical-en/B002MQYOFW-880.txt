There was quite a bit of action in this last book - but it seemed to me that the characters - especially Katniss - were very wooden.  In the first two books they came alive and we could identify with all the characters.  That was gone in this book.  The plot was a little predicable too.  Don't think the characters would have put up with that stuff in the book.  But still a good read.
