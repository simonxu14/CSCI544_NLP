Loved the Hunger Games and enjoyed Catching Fire, but found the final installment a real let down.<br /><br />The are two main reasons for this. The first is that there were story lines and characters developed in the first two books that were destroyed in a sentence or two, or simply ignored as though they never existed. Finnick, Johanna and Gale come to mind, as does the mission to get Snow. The second reason is that so much of the action happens away from Katniss. In choosing the first person narration, the author ought to have been conscious of how leaving the narrator out of crucial events can distance the audience from those events, from the main character and from the story itself.<br /><br />I hope the movies can improve on the lacklustre ending to a trilogy that began with such an interesting premise and so much promise.
