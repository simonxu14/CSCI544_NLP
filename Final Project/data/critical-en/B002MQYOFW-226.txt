Mockingjay by Suzanne Collins<br />'''''<br /><br />In the final book of the Hunger Games trilogy Katniss fought back against President Snow. She was the Mockingjay, the symbol of the rebellion. She had to be an example and lead the rebellion while also dealing with her emotions. The Capital had captured Peeta and the number one thing she wanted was for him to be safe. The second thing Katniss wanted was to kill President Snow for all the pain and destruction he had caused.<br /><br />I was very disappointed with this book, after being so excited to read it after finishing Catching Fire and loving it. I felt the story lacked real emotion. It was more like reading a series of events, without really feeling emotionally connected to the characters, like I had with the other books. I read things that should have pulled at my heart but I only felt disconnected from the story.<br /><br />I don't mean to be harsh but after the beautiful work the author showed with the first two books this was a huge let down. I'm perfectly happy reading books that aren't all happy and have fairy-tale endings. I read a ton of books that do not have happy endings. With that said I need to feel the emotion that the characters are supposedly feeling. I did not feel that in this book. This book gave me the feeling like that author was done with the series and just wanted to end it.<br /><br />I also didn't like how the future was tacked on. When I was reading it all I could think of is Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. It was different because the story was not the same as Harry Potter. It showed her about twenty years later, who she ended up with and how her life turned out. This also made a statement from the author saying, "ok you know how their lives ended up, I'm done." It didn't feel original or give me much of a feeling for the characters' lives.<br /><br />The story line was a good idea but I just felt that it was wrongly executed. She could have made this last installment great but instead I feel like she ruined it.<br /><br />There are people that enjoyed Mockingjay, Claire from YA Bookie Monster loved it, read her review on goodreads.
