Finally decided to read The Hunger Games Trilogy after I found it on Amazon for a great price.  The books were an easy read and for the most part well written.  My only real problem with the books is by the end of the trilogy I really did not like the main character.  Normally you fall in the love with the main character of a book but in this case by the end I really didn't care one way or another what happened to her.  I guess it really wasn't my type of a story.
