I've obviously missed something that hundreds of reviewers loved.  Seeing so many positive reviews and seeing that it was published by Scholastic led me to believe this book was something that I would at least find interesting.  Children fighting to the death is sick.  If there are missed metaphors on my part, then so be it...at 59 with a Masters degree in Modern Studies this book didn't resonate on any level.  I haven't read so-called science fiction in many, many years and if this is the "new" science fiction then I guess I'll stick to historical fiction and the like.  I see nothing in this book to recommend it and am perplexed about its popularity.
