My wife, daughter and I bought 3 books at 12:01 AM on July 8th so we each could have one to read at our leisure.  My wife and I inscribed: &quot;We love you&quot; into our 9-year-old daughter's book. We cannot return that  book because we wrote in it, but the other 2 are going back.<br />The first  three books had an acceptable balance of intrigue and humor. Book 4 is  offensive and certainly is not for children. I can't read book 4 to my  daughter.<br />We are very disappointed. I hope book 5 is better.
