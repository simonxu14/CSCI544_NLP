To an extent, authors must write what the market demands. If it is gore, or hormonal tantrums that are in demand, the author must write about gore and hormonal tantrums. That's essentially what this book contains, together with a narcissistic depiction of luxury that neither the characters nor most of us would ordinarily have.<br /><br />Yet, authors have the opportunity to mix in a more nutritious message. I picked up the book hoping that in addition to the gore there would be a unique exploration of the circumstances of an America divided into an imperial center and colonized periphery. I thought there would be segues into the economics, the political arrangements. At least a shimmer of a coming re-revolution.<br /><br />But no, the only faintest allusion to such matters is a couple of sentences every 100 pages where a particularly adolescent mind thinks hissily "if only the capital hadn't forced us to fight". What a waste! Even a historical account of how things came to be that way would have been nice. But no, the sole focus of such an intriguing context is just a minimal excuse for a setting where humans kill each other for the entertainment of other human beings.<br /><br />The rest of the text is divided roughly equally into gore, and the most simplistic kind of emotional angst. The latter comprises of person A kind of being nice to person B and then person B feels particularly obliged to person A sparing their life for just a little bit.<br /><br />It occurs to me that it is nothing but an extension of the tabloid/reality-show fascination. The fact that it is<br />popular with current youth bothers me because I was kinda hoping things would swing back to better with the next generation, but part of me worries that they'd just love to have some excuse to watch some kind of kill-fest. And there's a lot of war going around already.<br /><br />Also "Peeta" - the most ridiculous choice of name in a novel with also a significant focus on food. Yes, all the basal instincts are covered and nothing at at a higher plane. The love story from Peeta's side is as sappy and simplistic and unbelievable as it possibly could be.<br /><br />One more thing, be prepared to develop a mild desire to eat rabbit as you work through the gore and sap.
