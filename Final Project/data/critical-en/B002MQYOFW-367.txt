I really enjoyed the twists and turns of the first and second books. However I felt that this book dragged on. When things of interest finally did begin to happen 3/4 of the way through, they seems rushed to finish and tie up all the loose ends to end the book. I wasn't happy with how the story ended because I felt the author just gave the readers what they wanted without any explanation of how they got there. I like the hunger game trilogy but I'm still left with questions of how the characters got from point T to Z.
