I realize their are many bad reviews for this book, as well as good ones. And I also know some people absolutely loved this book, whiles others were greatly disappointed. I would like to categorize myself in the "greatly disappointed" group. This book basically ruined the whole series for me. At the end, I was wishing I never even bothered with the series. I've never disliked the ending to a series/book as much as I did with this book.<br /><br />I have never said/thought/ this before, but when the movies for this series come out, I HOPE the directors make the ending to the series better than the book does. Usually I go to the movies hoping the producers and directors stayed as close to the book as possible, but with this, I'm hoping they do the exact opposite with the third book/movie.<br /><br />Sorry for all of those that love this book and the way it ended the series, but we will have to agree to disagree. I will not be recommending this book to anyone.<br />Although, I might recommend the first two books, and warn them away from the third and tell them to come up with their own ending.
