I won't give it away even though I feel like everyone should know. I read this book because I enjoyed the first 2 movies. I got it free for down loading Kindle for my IPad. One person that they should have let be really left a bad taste. The author still could have ended the story exactly the same way. I am not sure if I will go to the theater to watch the final installment since I read the book. I will not buy another series by this author.
