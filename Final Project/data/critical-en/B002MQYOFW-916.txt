I did read this book quickly, and it was a very engaging story. But I guess true to its genre I felt very cheated. The character development felt so rushed and the insights into why they each behaved the way they did seemed so underdeveloped.<br /><br />I also never fully embrace the pretense of the book, that children placed in an arena will choose to kill each other even if they are compelled to do so.<br /><br />I also find it disturbing that this type of plot is so popular. uggh, is this what entertains us today, a life and death survivor????<br /><br />I am giving it three stars but only because it kept me reading, which is more than i can say for most books.
