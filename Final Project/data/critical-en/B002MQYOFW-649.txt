The Hunger Games is the first book of The Hunger Games trilogy and it is a great introduction. Though the book is targeted towards young adults, regular adults will find it a great read as well. Think of it as a futuristic Lord of the Flies that takes place on reality television. It introduces the two main characters in a way that will make you care about whether they live or die. The problem arises when those are the only two characters that are really developed. Not all stories require character development, but when a story is about people's lives being on the line you want more development from all the characters.<br /><br />All in all it's a good introduction and the end will leave you wanting more, which is great because there are two followups. If you have time read it, you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />It's not groundbreaking, but it's enjoyable.<br /><br />Also if you liked the movie and you like reading, then you'll like the book.
