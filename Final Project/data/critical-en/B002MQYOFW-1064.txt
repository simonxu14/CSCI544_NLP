I think I may be the only one in North America but I hated this book. We read it as part of a book club. I was a bit shocked to find that we think that children murdering other children is an appropriate theme for a "Young Adult" book.<br /><br />I get that it's post-apocalyptic and so forth, but I found very little to be redeeming in this book. It's violent and I found it pretty awful to read.
