I purchased the Hunger Games trilogy because  I found out that it was being taught in Junior High English classes, and, as a teacher, I wanted to see what kids were reading these days.  I read them all to get the whole story.  They're ok, but all are a great deal more violent than I would recommend for the target audience - 12 - 14 year olds.  Mockingjay, in particular,  is very brutal and violent.  I would recommend that parents read these books before turning them over to their young teens.
