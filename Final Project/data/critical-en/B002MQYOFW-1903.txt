It takes a lot for me to 'dislike' a book. Usually I just won't finish but the first two in the series were amazing. I really wanted to see how this would end. I wish I could turn back time. I actually had nightmares because of this book! There were things in this book that were more disturbing than even Stephen King has come up with. I actually felt sick to my stomach and questioned the author's sanity at times.<br />While the author's writing is stunning, for that I give it a two, but I can't look past the gruesome and disgusting elements. It's like she took sick pleasure in killing her beautiful characters in a horrific fashion.<br />I don't know, this one is going to stick with me way to long and not in a good way.  :c
