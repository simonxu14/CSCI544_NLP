Book/story is great, but the print/binding/feel of pages is horrible.  This is localized to the Amazon version of the book I think.  All other Harry Potter hardcovers I have the pages are much thicker.  The hardcover version of this book has flimsy pages that don't look like they'll stand up.  No book jacket.  I'm very disappointed.  I was unlike every other Harry Potter book I purchased from Amazon.  Quality is going downhill!
