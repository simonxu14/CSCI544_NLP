I read the &#34;Hunger Games&#34; trilogy years ago. However, after just seeing the last installment in the theater, (&#34;Mockingjay-Part II), I was driven to re-read this third book in the series. Frankly, I did not recall that the ending of the movie was an accurate reflection of the book. To my surprise it was very accurate. I found this book however to be the weakest of the series. It is long, at times ponderous, and not as page turning as the other two volumes. By the end, I was bored with the Gale-Peeta-Katniss love triangle and its associated tensions. And I was hoping for a more personal revenge in the death of President Snow. The reluctant heroine Katniss begins to wear thin in her war weariness, injuries, and emotional damage. Nonetheless it is still a good read and nice to see the film did stay true to the book.
