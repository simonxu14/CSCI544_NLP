I'm actually very upset that I didn't love this series. The first book was wonderful, with a strong female lead we could admire. The story line was riveting and new. However, the series goes on our heroine falls apart. I found myself hating Katniss by the end and everything she had become. Her story was no longer about a strong rebel girl but rather about a girl who wished to be rebellious and found herself more caught up in looking pretty for the camera. I hated how she gave up and every decision she made up to and including the epilogue she just "settled" for - there was no fight. Really a let down.
