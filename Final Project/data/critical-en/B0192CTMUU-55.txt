Lord Thingy hatches an insanely complex plan to kidnap Harry which insanely works.  Then the story nukes the fridge by having Lord Thingy's wand go haywire and it spits out a bunch of dead people.  Apparently JK Rowling had this scene in mind from book one.  I wish she had skipped those dreadful horcruxes and killed Lord Thingy right here.
