When I ordered the book, I was lead to believe that it was in good condition. But when I received it there was tons of marking in the book and the cover was  practically falling off. Whoever had the book before must have used it for school because there was due dates and sticky notes and lots of other writing in it. By the time I almost finished the book, the front cover fell off entirely! I am very disappointed with this seller and I will avoid buying anything from them again.
