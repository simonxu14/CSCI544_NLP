Her writing style goes as far downhill as possible in this book. Very disappointing. I know Katniss is supposed to be 'realistic' in dealing with the trauma of her situation, but after the umpteenth time of a detailed listing of how a certain injury or other hurt her, I was ready to quit. Generally the main character of a story is not unconscious and left out of all the plans 85% of the time.
