I have read the entire "Hungar Games" Trilogy and was satisfied with the book. Although its' oreintation was  toward teenage girls, the story was engaging enough to keep the readers interest until completion of the story. I did not care for the lead character, Katniss and after viewing the movie my opinion of her did not change.  Also, the movie sucked giant donkey dicks! It was horribly boring but I digress,...  I would recommend the books to anyone for light but engaging reading.
