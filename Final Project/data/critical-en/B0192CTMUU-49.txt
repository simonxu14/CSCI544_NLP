I could not wait to start Goblet of Fire after reading the first three HP books in less than two weeks. However, I am sad to say I am disappointed in this one. There are three problems with this book as far as I am concerned. The first problem is that this is a much darker book than the first three HP books. In the first three books, there is description of only one death altogether (prof. Quirrel in the first book). In this book there are graphic details of two deaths plus various scenes of violence (the Death Eaters march, the Flesh, Bone and Blood Ceremony, etc.). I can see Rowling deciding to make the book a little bit more grown up but I don't like it. The other two problems are more fundamental. First is the plot. The whole Triwizard Tournament is too convoluted. As a device to get us to the ending of this book, it is too drawn out and too encompassing to leave us any wiggle room for other niceties of the Hogwarts world. Add to that some of the secondary characters that are not necessary (Rita the reporter comes to mind) the book drags on. Finally, and this is the biggest problem with the book, the villain comes completely out of the left field. There is no explanation for his behavior until the very end and no clues as far as why he is the villain. Add to it the fact that Fudge doesn't believe Harry when he says Voldemort has come back, the ending of this book is utterly unsatisfactory. I like a book where the villians and the heros are smart. In this one Fudge borders on being idiotic (of course he could end up being one of Voldemort's minions after all). To me the first two HP books are still the best.
