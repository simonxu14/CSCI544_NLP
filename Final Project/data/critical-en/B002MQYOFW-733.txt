Just got through the last book, and it was no small feat.  I read book one in a day and gave it 5 stars.  Book two, i spent 3 days on and gave it 3 stars.  It took me two weeks to make my way through Mockingjay and I almost quit reading it altogether a couple of times.  It got one lonely star.  How did the series devolve so quickly into the muddled, unpalatable mess that was Mockingjay?  Not just the story arc but even the main characters became increasingly unlikable or just plain rediculous.  Very flat effort for the finale.
