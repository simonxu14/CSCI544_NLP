Just another unbelievable thriller with heros doing impossible things in a boring and an unlikely fantasy scenario.  The novelty is that this time the hero is a girl with amazing forest survival skills. Nothing interesting int he story, not badly written, it is a pitty that the author did not find a more interesting or credible story to use in her saga.
