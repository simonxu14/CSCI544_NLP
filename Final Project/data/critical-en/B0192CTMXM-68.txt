Those of us who have been following the boy wizard through his years at Hogwarts will find Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows a riveting read and one that answers many of the unanswered questions in earlier books.  I was, however, very disappointed that Rowling choose as her final climax,  a Battle of Hogwarts in which the students, just barely of age, joined Harry in fighting Voledemort and his Death Eating followers.<br /><br /> Where's the magic in that?  I felt the book catered too much to mindless  public blood lust for violence, war and death.<br /><br />Surely it really would be magic to confront the forces of evil and today's market place without the necessity of killing off somebody.
