Personally I loved the first two books and while this one is not bad it completely disappointed me...in the end I felt like there was no real resolution and of course I also felt depressed.<br /><br />Even though I understand this book is primarily about war and the fact that afterwards with so many casualties and traumas sometimes is hard to separate the winners from the losers, this wasnt the only thing the book/trilogy was about, I feel like Mrs Collins decided to take a completely different turn with this book and honestly it was very disappointing that the Peeta many of us grew to love was pretty much taken away (for most of the book) when I have to admit his character was my favorite being that he provided a balance and a touch of "sweetness" to the story.<br /><br /> Also, being that Peeta is not really in the book I wish I would've been able to feel the relationship between Gale and Katniss more, yet even though they've been best friends for so long and apparently love one another they're relationship really doesn't translate into a passionate one for me.<br /><br />I dont really want to write an essay for a review because Im actually too disappointed in this ending but the book ends like it begins for me, Katniss never really choses who she's in love with, and being that I love Peeta's character I find it extremely unfair to him. Katniss starts off lost, sad, being manipulated...goes through the book being in the hospital, drugged up, filming what feels like a reality show or documentary, again lost, sad, manipulated and ends up.....lost,sad and apparently still being manipulted since according to her she only has the children because of Peeta.<br /><br />I get it war is bad but I ended up almost disliking Katniss' character being that she could apparently not make any real decisions and was void of emotions, also I did not really care about who died being that everyone was dying and Im still wondering who she would've chosen...had she actually chosen. I hope they make some changes if the do make the third movie.
