I feel like the series started great and only got better with each of the first four books.  But the final three books, to me, were an unwieldy road to The End.  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows sits with Order of the Phoenix for me as my two least favorite in the series.  Burdened with the weight of too much going on, and hindered by too many complications to ever gain momentum, this simply wasn't a page-turner for me.  However it did all lead to a very satisfying, and suitably grandiose, ending for the series.<br /><br />I may not the be the only one who, as much as I loved these books, am glad it's over.
