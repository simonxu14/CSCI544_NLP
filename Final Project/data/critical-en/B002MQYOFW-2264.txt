Books one and two of the trilogy are truly fantastic. The third book is a disjointd amalgam of different genres. Sci-fi with some comic book archetypes, a few flashbacks to the movie "Saw", and oddly enough a depressing ending that seems to have been lifted from an early draft of "Crime and Punishment". I loved the first two books and the great characters the author brought to life--if it only had ended around page 100 of Mockingjay...
