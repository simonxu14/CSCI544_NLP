I'm giving this book 2 stars because I really feel that they could have utilized the space on the pages for more info on the Pokemon. Normally, I will use Serebii online to get my Pokemon info and I was really hoping this book would reduce my use of having to look online. Now that I have it, I see that I will still need to go online and probably quite a bit.<br />Things I would like to see added would be where they can be found and in what games.<br />The lv's that each Pokemon evolve at as well as any other special way a Pokemon evolves, such as, it SHOULD tell you that you need a fire stone to get a Flareon, or you need to trade to get Alakazam. (I almost feel like that should have been a given!!!)<br />And last, what lv's each Pokemon learn certain moves at.<br />These things for me are all key reasons I would need to know info on a Pokemon and I was a bit disappointed to know I will still need to look it up which makes this book obsolete to me.<br />Hope my review helps!!
