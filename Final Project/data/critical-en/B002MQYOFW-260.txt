It took some time to sort out why I was disappointed in this book.  I wondered if it was the writing, the main character, the whole premise of the book, or if it was simply that I'm an adult reading a novel for adolescents, so I was expecting too much.  I don't think it's this last one, though, for a few reasons.  So I started looking at some of the things that bothered me about the book, and I think what it really boils down to is the writing and the author's choice of first person, present tense point of view.<br /><br />Too often the author felt the need to "tell" what is happening with the character by having her state what's going on, rather than letting it show, or *only* letting it show.  I know this might be difficult in first person POV, but it can be done.  (I think the novel would've been stronger if she had just chosen a different mode.)<br /><br />(****spoiler alert****)<br />The most cringe-worthy moment  of Katniss pointing out the obvious is in chapter 18 a little bit after  the 12-year old tribute dies.  Right when it happens, we hear Katniss' thoughts, how she finally understands something Peeta had said, and she takes actions that show something in her has changed.  Then she gets the bread from the little girl's district, and I actually got a little teary-eyed.  I thought that was such a great moment--the best in the book.  Just a few pages later, though, we hear Katniss start prattling on in her mind about how Rue's death changed her, how now she wants revenge, blah, blah, blah.  The author shouldn't have had to point that out.  We knew (or we hoped), that something in her changed.  We saw what she did in the meadow before they took the body away, how she saluted her fellow tribute.  We saw when Katniss slipped into a brief depression, didn't want to get out of the tree, didn't want to move anymore, and had to order herself to get going.  The author should have left it alone.  Having Katniss point out the obvious like this makes her seem more self-absorbed and shallow than what is probably intended.  But, too, her stating that she wants revenge at this point isn't really a change.  She already hates the Capitol, what it does to starve people to death in her own district, and she raves against it with Gale in the woods all the time.  So what's new there?  I don't know.  I guess it's just that she's finally coming to realize it?  So is it just that she's learned something about herself here?  The change I suppose I was looking for was for her to actually step outside of herself and her emotional angst just a little more, start being able to connect to others a little better, to risk trusting people (other than girls who remind her of her harmless sister), to see they have a common cause (the other district sent her that precious loaf of bread!!).  But instead she just continues being suspicious and of others' motives all the time.<br /><br />The scene of Katniss' depression brings me to another point.  I thought it was odd that she doesn't think of her mother's own struggle with depression after her father's death.  Yes, Katniss does far better than her mother in recovering, but it makes her seem pretty shallow and self-absorbed to not be just a little bit humbled in her judgment of her mother.  As a kid, she has every right to be angry that her mother didn't take care of her and her sister.  But, as a book for young adults, this would be a great moment to see some character development, to see Katniss growing into a more aware adult.  Even just a little.  Maybe she doesn't completely forgive her mother, but maybe she understands her a little better.  I think her own emotional wounds, like her mother's, have led her to cut herself off from others.<br />(***End Spoilers***)<br /><br />I don't mean to say that I think Katniss should be some perfect hero.  I prefer my characters to be complex, to have struggles, to be not-quite-good or not-quite-bad.  The characters in the Song of Fire and Ice (Game of Thrones) series are excellent examples.  But Katniss didn't come across as very complex at all to me.  Her constant questioning of everyone's motives and going on and on about not wanting to owe people makes her pretty tiresome after a while.  I think she has the potential to be a lot more compelling, and I mostly blame the writing choices for her character falling so flat.  Maybe she'll do more growing the subsequent books.  I hope so, because I still plan to read them, just to see.  If I'm still left disappointed, at least I've only lost a few days of reading.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I also find the whole world of the Hunger Games fairly unbelievable, too.  I reread Ender's Game a few years ago, and I liked it nearly as much as when I read it in high school.  That's one reason why I don't think my problems with the The Hunger Games can be chalked up to it being fiction for young adults.  Like Katniss, Ender goes through some pretty horrible abuses at the hands of the state, but I never found myself getting weary of Ender or being unable to suspend my disbelief.  I've ready plenty of dystopian books, but I found myself more confused by this world than drawn into it.  I haven't put my finger on why this is, but have a sense that there's a disjunct between this tyrannical government and the way the Hunger Games are broadcast as reality TV.  Something about this arrangement doesn't seem quite believable to me.  Maybe it's because I've never watched that much reality TV?  Or maybe it's just the limited first-person POV again?<br /><br />I've giving it 3 stars because Amazon says this means I think "it's okay" rather than two stars, which means "I don't like it."  Probably, I'm somewhere in between.  It's a quick read, and worth reading to know the story everyone's talking about.  And I can't help but like most dystopian novels, regardless of their flaws, because it's always interesting to take a peek into some crazy, things-gone-wrong world that someone has invented.
