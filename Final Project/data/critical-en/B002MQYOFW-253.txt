Like other reviewers, I found this book to be rather disappointing. Katniss does not develop much as a character and spends most of her time as a pawn of other characters or under sedation. The action is murky and uninteresting. The grand finale is underwhelming. This could have been so much better!<br /><br />Mihai Pruna<br />Author, Blood in the Sandbox
