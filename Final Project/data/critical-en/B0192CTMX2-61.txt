Let's get real, we've been waiting for too long not to devour it.  It's very different in tone from the others - much darker.  This is the book where the battle between good and evil becomes much more serious; were it otherwise, Voldemort would risk looking more like the "Curses, foiled again" villain in a third-rate melodrama.  The Hogwarts students have grown up very fast, and the rapid changes in characters can be jarring.  They have as many unloveable traits as most adolescents.  Kudos to Rowling for displaying the warts on her heroes, although it makes her one-dimensional portrayals of the bad guys (with a single exception) more glaringly deficient.<br />It's not an *enjoyable* book, especially.  If these are the times that try wizards' souls, Faithful Reader is tried along with them.  There's very little comic relief; the few victories bring bitter vindication rather than bubbling joy.  A defter touch with language might have made the struggles outlined in Book Five utterly compelling.  Instead, this is the exposition we must wade through with the faith that Harry will triumph at the end of the series.
