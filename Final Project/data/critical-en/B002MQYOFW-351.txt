I am so disappointed with this book. What should/could have been a beautiful, poingient ending to such an epic story fell completely flat on everything that made the first two books wonderful: brilliant pacing, thoughtful character development, and complicated relationships between those characters.<br /><br />In sharp contrast, Mockingjay was a rushed, thoughtless ending to what seems to be a different story entirely from the first two books. War is full of human atrocities and horrors. I get it...you can stop beating me over the head with it after chapter two, Suzanne Collins.<br /><br />I truly wish I'd stopped reading after book two.
