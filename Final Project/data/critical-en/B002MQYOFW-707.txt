I agree with the many other readers who feel that this book was lacking a great deal in many aspects. The characters really didnt evovle for me like in the other two books.  I wished the author would have spent less time focusing on the "war" and more on the relationships between the characters because really that's why we got hooked on the series in the first place.  Katniss fell apart for most of the book. this is not the same strong female character we knew from the first two books. I understand that shes been through a lot and some kind of breakdown was to be expected.  however, it went on and on and it took away from the story. In addition, There really wasn't any closure with regards to the characters.  I'm glad at the end Katniss and Peeta ended up together but it seemed like an after thought. The story was lacking love and romance.  The other two books build up the choice katniss has to make between gale and Peeta and the author fails to tell the story well.  What happened to Haymitch? Gale?  They were a vital part of her life and they hardly get mentioned at the end, no closure. The book fell short. It leaves you wanting more.
