I finished the first two books of the trilogy and began this one with enthusiasm and joy. By the time I hit the two-thirds mark, I was shocked and disappointed, and by the time I ended the book,depressed and disgusted.<br /><br />Scores of reviewers have already commented on the sloppy plot, non-existent character development, missing storylines, ad nauseum, so I won't repeat their sentiments here. Neither am I all that fussed about the love triangle. All I can say is that their comments were justified. This book was a massive letdown. I'm disappointed in both author and editor for allowing this to go to press as it stands. I could find better fan fic out there, and I hope I do, so I can wash away the bad taste that was left in my mouth. I don't look to books for happy ever after, but I don't expect lectures either. We get that war is bad; we can read newspapers and watch the news for that. At the very best, she built up a great story and characters and then sucked the life, meaning, significance, and sheer fun out of them in this book. One review said it was like the author giving us two puppies and killing them; to me, it's like taking Buttercup the beloved pet cat and shooting it in front of Prim.<br /><br />When I bought this book, I was mystified by the low ratings compared to the first two, but didn't pay any attention to them. After all, ratings typically drop off in series. Well, now I understand why. I wish I had paid attention to the ratings, and just pretended that the book ended at book 2. I'm giving this book 1 star and wished I could give it a negative rating, so that unsuspecting readers like myself don't get duped into buying or reading this one, and wind up being feeling so disappointed.
