I loved the first book so I continued the series.  The second book was a little less thrilling.  This  one was a disappointment.  I think the author made Katniss a very fickle character with very few endearing qualities.  I hoped after the first Hunger Games her character would grow up.  By the end of the series I felt sorry for both Peeta and Gale.
