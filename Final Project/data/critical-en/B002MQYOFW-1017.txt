I read the entire book , it was a bit like , I presume like watching an accident you had to see it all. At times through the book I felt it was like reading a fairy tale .<br />I am not a often reader of fantasy and I will not be reading any more of the series so that probably says enough<br />But wanted to read what the hype was about .
