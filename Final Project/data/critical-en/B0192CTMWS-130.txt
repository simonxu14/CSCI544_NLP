This is a dark book in which Harry's lifetime of problems come full circle.  He's angry, and refuses to listen to what anyone tells him to.  Harry's blant disregard for authority gets someone killed.  And once again Dumbledor knows all but refuses to tell anything until the end of the book.  I would not recommend this book to anyone under the age of 15.
