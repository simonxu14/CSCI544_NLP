A horrible ending to a series.  The first two books were dark, but you felt there was hope.  This third book was that opportunity for hope...Suzanne Collins brutally murdered the hope.  I felt genuinely depressed after this read...kinda gross actually, like I had witnessed a horrific event.  Irreparable damage is done to the characters in Panem, and the readers feel that.<br /><br />Aside from the depressing ending, the book itself was less action packed than the previous two.  Much of the book is filled with wallowing in Katniss' depression until she heals enough to get out there and fight...only to be knocked back into a depressed stupor...again and again.  Much of the book seemed forced.  It was just ugly all around.  If the &#34;Mockingjay&#34; is the symbol of hope for the resistance, it reads quite the opposite in real life.  A depressing ending to an already brutal series.  If you haven't read it, then pass on it.
