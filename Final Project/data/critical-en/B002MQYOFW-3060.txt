The series was full of powerful women. It was beautiful. Collins did a wonderful job establishing & defining degrees of strong women. It was definitely refreshing vs the cattiness & delicate flower seen too often in novels/tv/film/etc . . .<br /><br />. . . that's where it ends.<br /><br />Katniss' character in book 3 falls short of the build up in 1 & 2. It was annoying. She gives in to other people's expressions of happiness, success and solitude. WTF happened???<br /><br />Her melt down towards submissiveness was too little, too late and tiring. What happened to her resolve? It was there. She understood her place on the chess board.<br /><br />She should have committed suicide in a way that kept her out of martyrdom but in the confines of her revolutionist ideology, which Collins did not allow to exist.<br /><br />. . .  I'm so frustrated. I'll pretend this 3rd book didn't happen.
