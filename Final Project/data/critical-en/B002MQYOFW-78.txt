I was a fan of the first two books, and was excited to finish the series.  Though much of the first part was decent in my opinion - not great, but had potential to turn around - the ending left me with nothing but blank confusion.  I can't think of another book, particularly the last book in an otherwise good series, that I liked less than this one.<br /><br />Though I think it would be hard to not read the third book, my recommendation is to finish after the second and make up your own ending in your head!  This book will likely just disappoint.
