First, my copy has eight pages with extremely light print so that they are almost illegible.  Now, the author has made excessive amounts of money writing about Harry and friends.  In every book she beats the poor kid into the ground.  The final book is an overkill of sadism.  Harry has made his author the riches person in England so must we believe that cruelty pays. The joy taken in tearing apart every one and every thing young Harry believes in is most extemely hurtful.  The author gives Harry the ability to restore the dead to life yet, he doesn't do this when those who defended him lie dead on the floor of Hogwarts.  She then lets Harry fake death to the horror of those who loved and defended him.  She takes forever to bring joy and happiness to some of the characters and then snatches it away. We now have another orphan growing up in Harry's care that could launch another set of "beat a kid up" books by this author. This book is a sad conclusion to a series that could have been great.  Why, in a world of so much pain and violence, can't we have some degree of decency.  This is a poor example to set before children.
