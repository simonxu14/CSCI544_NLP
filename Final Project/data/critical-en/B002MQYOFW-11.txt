I stepped away from this book so disappointed.  I'm not upset about how the story ended, but just how it got there.  Reading three books with hundreds of pages for the climax of the story and finale to be finished in a couple of pages!  Was the author rushed?  Was she trying to meet a deadline?  Was she tired of writing?  Well, that is how it feels!  I read pages of descriptions about Buttercup, nightmares, food, clothing, etc, only to read the burning of Katniss, death of Coin and fall of the capital in a couple pages.  So disappointing.  So many questions.  So blah.  The author could have even stretched this out into a fourth book.  I'm glad I only interrupted a week of my life to read all three books.  The screen writers for the third movie will have their hands full, trying to FINISH the author's book to be acceptable for the screen and the fans who won't be reading the books.
