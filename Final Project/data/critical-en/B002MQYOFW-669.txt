It is impossible to review Mockingjay without reflecting also on the first two books of the trilogy. I found the Hunger Games to be a riveting action/fantasy that propelled me from page to page.  At the same time, a feeling of discomfort built with each page with the increasing realization that this was a novel whose drama was based on the sadistic slaughter of children.  The two main protagonists were magnificent, brave and compelling but the heroics involved being forced to kill 13 and 14 year olds.<br />As Hunger Games evolves into Catching Fire, the characters seek to pull the mask off of this display to expose it to the citizens of Panem for what it really is: not true drama, not true romance, not even true celebrity - just forcing children to be gladiators and assuring that their demise is as gruesome as possible.<br />In Mockingjay, Suzanne Collins essentially assures that the mask is pulled off for the readers as well.  Mockingjay is not just a statement about the harsh realities of war, it is not just the story of exposing to Panem the horror that lies beneath the cloak of romance, celebrity and bravery - it is, in a sense also a rebuke to her readers as she heavy-handidly details the grim unraveling of the three main characters and the horrific butchering of the other secondary characters.  The Hunger Games is a thrilling romance of dashing bravery with some disturbing undertones of sadism.  Mockingjay concludes the trilogy with an expose of how brutal, sordid and contrived the games really are.  Suzanne Collins seems to want to thrill her readers with the first book and chastise with the third.  As this huge success goes to film, I'm left with some discomfort about her having it both ways.
