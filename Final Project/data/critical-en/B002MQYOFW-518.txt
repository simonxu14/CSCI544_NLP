After reading the first book in the series, I had high hopes for the other two.  The second one was alright, but this one just was outright bad.  While the first two took me a week to read, this one took me over a month due to total lack of interest.  The main characters from the other two books seemed to disappear in this one.  I also did not like the way Katniss seemed to change constantly from one moment to the next.  Just didn't like it...
