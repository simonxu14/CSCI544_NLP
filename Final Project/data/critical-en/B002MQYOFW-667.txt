I loved the first 2 books of this series. However, I was extremely disappointed in this last book.  It was very sad and depressing, and I felt like the author went over the top for the sake of entertainment. The beginning started out well, then the plot was all over the place. It was just discouraging to follow this trilogy and then have it end with this last book.  Just stop after the first two. :(
