In an odd bit of synchronicity, two or three months ago we saw this book at Michael's and my eldest daughter wanted it then. I talked her out of it since she had no idea who or what Pokemon was and as such the book would have meant nothing to her within 24 hours. Bah, little did I know that there would be a game called Pokemon Go which would become a huge hit / craze and that my eldest daughter wanted to know more. So we ordered this book.<br /><br />From a content perspective, she is totally happy. She is looking and reviewing and reading about the characters every single day. Personally I expected a bit more in the descriptions; they seemed light in content but then an adult quickly approaching 50 is probably not their target audience. The big issue we had though was that within 2-3 days the book began to fall apart. It's a paperback and the glue holding it together did not stick. Pages were falling out all the time. We taped some pages in but it kept getting worse. So Grandma saved the day and bought a hardcover of the same book. No more falling apart and the same content kept my daughter happy. The old book got recycled and now the new one is carried everywhere with her.
