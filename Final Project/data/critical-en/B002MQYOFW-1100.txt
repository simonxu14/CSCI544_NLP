The final episode was a major let down. Collins either put much less effort into Mockingjay or was rushed by publishers. The weak ending will have you scratching your head and probably being frustrated. It is unfortunate that such a significant series has such an uninspired conclusion. That being said, you have to read this book if you've read the first two.
