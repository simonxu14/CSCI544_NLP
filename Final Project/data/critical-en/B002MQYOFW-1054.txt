A mediocre ending for a series that started so strongly.<br />I think the ending was a bit excessive.  I cant talk about it to much without giving it away.  We all know Catniss doesn't want to be a warrior.  She doesn't fight until forced to do so.  she has been through a lot with those around her suffering and paying the price of rebellion.  How much loss is to much?  At what point is killing and injuring those around her enough?
