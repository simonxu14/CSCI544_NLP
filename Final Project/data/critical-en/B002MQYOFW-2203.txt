Big Disappointment!!!  I was excited for this book.  Loved the first two.  Totally disappointed with this book about 3/4 of the way through.  How depressing and violent.  I would not recommend this book to younger audiences at all.  I hated that Peeta only got the attention he deserved about the last 2 pages.
