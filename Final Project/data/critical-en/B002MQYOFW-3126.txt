I know tons of people (adults and kids) who LOVE this trilogy, and I thought I would too, but I am definitely not a fan. I just can't stomach the subject matter. I love a good, suspenseful, hard-fought good-triumphs-over-evil story: murder mysteries, spy thrillers, Harry Potter, Lord of The Rings, etc, but I didn't find any good triumphing over evil in The Hunger Games. Perhaps the next two books rectify that, but I have no desire at all to read them, and from what I've heard (even from fans), that doesn't happen. It reminds me too much of the young boys taken from their families in war-ravaged Africa and forced to be soldiers, trained to murder, ordered to kill or be killed.
