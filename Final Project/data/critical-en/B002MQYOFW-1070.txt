In my review of this book it was okay but the other two were the best. This one was a little rushed and a little less detailed than the others. Otherwise it was pretty good at the end. This is to Suzanne Collins you should write the epilogue and make it a book about Katniss's and Peeta's kids. That would be an interesting book have them some how bring back the games or make a new kind of game
