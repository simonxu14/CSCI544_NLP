This will be a very short review because I can't get specifics without spoilers. If you have read the first two you will read the last no matter what. This one was all around the weakest of the trilogy with so many things that happened that truly had no point to the outcome but to be there just to break the spirit of Katniss. ***Minor spoiler, it will at the end give Katniss a peaceful life, but there was no point to her greatest sorrow. All I will say if you can read a library copy. Fortunately, if you do buy it will not be at the hard covered prices.
