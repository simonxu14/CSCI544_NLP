Well of course there is little comparison between the two. Whilst the movie was OK the book is infinitely better.<br /><br />The author has expressed some bizarre and quirky events which I think will appeal to the younger generation, although I was intrigued by the story, the wonderfully colourful narration and glad when I got to the end.<br /><br />It certainly is worth reading...take it on holiday with you and you will taken with the characters to some place else!
