I must say I went into this book reluctantly. I found the premise to be disturbing--a bunch of teenagers going around killing each other. But so many people enjoyed it I thought I'd give it a try. I enjoyed the beginning. The pre-battle preparations I think teens might enjoy but it seemed unrealistic that there was not more discussion and feeling about their impending death. I felt puzzled at the morality of the whole thing which never seemed to be addressed. I think young people could have benefited from more discussion and attention to what this meant to your fellow contestant--even the worst are from families that would be devastated at their loss. There also was no history or understanding of exactly how these games came about other than a nebulous referral to a "rebellion". I would have liked more development of that and I found the public viewing of the games nauseating. I would have given it 3 stars because of those points but on the positive side, I found the writing of the last half of the book page turning and exciting and found myself immersed in it. I thought the author did a good job of not being overly gory and had several of the deaths occur from the environment they encountered rather than direct hits from each other. I thought the death of Rue showed one of the few moments of humanity in the book. However, looking at it as a fantasy story to take you to another place it think it was exciting and adventurous and I did like some of the creative thinking of the characters and their resourcefulness. I think it would make a thrilling movie and fun to see all the costumes and scenery
