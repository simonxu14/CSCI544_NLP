As written in my review of book 2, I enjoyed the story, until the end.  And I still couldn't care about the caracter.  Nothing she did inspired me to like her.  Nothing.  The twist at the end was unexpected, but right before that I was like &#34;WTF just happend!?&#34; because the story was going well...and then just went sideways.  I was really disappointed in how it went.  But I was more disappointed that I couldn't care about the character.
