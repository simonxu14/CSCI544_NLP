Wow, the customer reviews were about the book.  I have read it and now want to order the audiobook CDs.  Sadly Amazon forgot to list the narrator.  I want to buy the Stephen Fry version, not the Jim Dale version.  Too bad.  Here I sit at my keyboard, ready to spend money but not doing so because I cannot find the information I need.
