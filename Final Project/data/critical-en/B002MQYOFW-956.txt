I have to say that the first 2 books in this series were very good. They were written well enough, but the subject is what really captures your attention and your imagination. I especially liked the 2nd book, Catching Fire, because it felt like it was setting up for a very interesting finish...<br /><br />...and that's where the series takes a turn for the worse. The final book, Mockingjay, had so much potential. But it failed in so many ways. It was as if the author was rushed into putting a complete story together. The author spends an excruciating amount of time turning the main character from a strong-willed survivalist caretaker into a weepy, mopey, whiny teenage brat. Yet somehow, through all her whining, the other characters hardly seem to notice the change in her.<br /><br />Within that context, the majority of Mockingjay is spent diving into the minutia of the main character's feelings for various characters in the book. But whenever the author finally broaches what SHOULD be the main focus of this final book, she glosses over it with a brief paragraph or two having some character explaining to the main character that it is now months later and all these momentous events happen. But apparently they're not momentous enough to spend any time exploring their significance...no the primary focus is the emotions of a teenager.<br /><br />Finally, as the 3rd book comes to a close, it takes some very weird turns and starts to stray into the territory of ridiculous. Then to top it off, because the author has spent so little time developing the plot and wasted so much time on the emotions of the main character, the ending makes very little sense. I think I understand what the author was TRYING to state through the main character's actions, but it's hard to know for sure when very little of an actual plot was explored in this book.<br /><br />Anyway...should you read it? Yeah, it's worth a read. I think that the author explored oppressiveness in a unique way. It certainly captures the imagination for a while. And while I suggest that you read the final book just so that you know what happens, I suggest that you do so with significantly lowered expectations.
