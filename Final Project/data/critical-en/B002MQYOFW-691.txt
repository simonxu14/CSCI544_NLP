As I said in the title, I really wanted to give the series a perfect 5... but I just can't... :(<br /><br />The main reason is I don't feel good and happy by the time I closed the last page of the last book. Instead, I feel confused, angry, and unsatisfied. As a writer myself, I know I can write a better conclusion to the story that doesn't change the intended ending at all. I just need to extend the last 3 pages into a new chapter of 20-25 pages. With that said...<br /><br />The goods:<br />1. It was really hard to put down the book(s) till the end.<br />2. It had a very interesting concept<br />3. It had lovable characters despite their flaws<br /><br />The bads:<br />1. The ending is too short and rather depressing<br />2. The romance element is too hurried and misses a lot of developments, especially in the last book<br />3. The characters had too many personality changes and mental issues in the last book and they spent more than 50% of the time in hospital or undergoing some physical/mental treatments. Gone are the strong protagonists you see in the first two books.
