I have never written a review before, but felt compelled to write one after having finished reading this trilogy.  My purpose in writing is because I am hoping that whoever writes the scripts for the ensuing movies reads these reviews.<br /><br />My wife rented the movie "The Hunger Games" and I enjoyed it so I decided to read the books.  Although I thought the style of writing was acceptable but not great, I enjoyed the story line tremendously and even told my wife as I was reading the second book that it was good, even though there was it was full of teenage romance, which, of course, she knows I don't like (although she does).  My enjoyment stopped with the last book, however.  My suggestions and criticisms:<br /><br />1)  Finnick.  The introduction of Finnick in the second book is excellent, but although he was such a major player in the second book, he is discarded in the last.  He becomes inconsequential when it is clear he is in love with a girl who has gone mad.  She should be discarded completely and he could easily become a leader, a third suitor, a mentor, anything but someone who has no use because he is lovesick.  And of course it is an insult to him that he just dies without any meaning.  He just dies.  Horrible writing.<br /><br />2)  Gale.  He starts out as the strong companion and ends up as inconsequential and heartless.  It is certainly implied that Katniss can never forgive him for the bomb that killed Primm and that Gale knows that as well.  Why?  Do we need that excuse so Katniss chooses by process of elimination?  the first book was full of teen romance and now we have none?  Doesn't fly. Gale should stay true to his character as being one who is protective of his family and Katriss and Primm and hangs on to that in the end.<br /><br />3.  Peeta.  He is such a great character until the last book. He and Primm are the good moral characters and that should stay true.  I like that he tries to kill Katriss and even the "real, not real" dialogues, but there is too little of his character development in the last book.<br /><br />4.  Primm.  She is the reason Katriss started the games.  She develops and loses her innocence, but still retains her purity.  Her death is so inconsequential it is insulting to the readers.<br /><br />5.  Coin.  She is as evil as Snow, which is intriguing.  But her evil should have been exposed.  One of the very few good parts of the third book is when katriss aims her arrow at Snow but kills Coin instead, just like the apple in the pig in the first book.  If Coin caused the deaths of innocent children she should be exposed so there is hope for the world.<br /><br />MY ENDING.  Katness sees Primm in danger and tries to rescue her, but a Peacekeeper sees her and goes after her.  Gale and Peeta both see this and Peeta rescues Katriss and Gale rescues Primm, but Gale dies in the process.  Peeta fulfills his role as always keeping Kariss alive,  Gale fulfills his role in looking after Katriss's sister and of course katriss ends up with Peeta.  Coin's misdeeds are exposed and Katriss is praised for her heroism.  Katriss, Peeta and Primm all move to Finnick's district and live happily ever after.  Finnick  eventually ends up as the President and the country at last has peace and a good leader.  Some may say it is a trite fairy-tale ending, but I am a 58 year old male, who has little use for chick flicks or romance novels, but this tale needs a happy ending!<br /><br />MY CRIICISM.  The last book ends hope.  It is almost a modern Les Miserables, but even in Les Miserables Cosette finds happiness and Jean ValJean is at peace knowing she is happy.  This book lacks the character and hope of Les Miserables and leaves us with just an empty feeling.  Not a good way to end a story or a film.<br /><br />I am hoping for some good movies from this story, because it could be good, but it can't be like the book.  To quote my granddaughters:  "That ending just sucks."
