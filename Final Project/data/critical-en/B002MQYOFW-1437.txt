Hindsight being twenty twenty...I should have stopped with book one...I would have walked way satisfied. Book one is a fresh concept. Although written for teens,  it contains a lot of violence. A love story laced with intense drama and character rich. Book 2 kept my  interest but ultimately let me down after a great book 1. Book three was a struggle to finish and left me with a sense of releif that it is finally over.
