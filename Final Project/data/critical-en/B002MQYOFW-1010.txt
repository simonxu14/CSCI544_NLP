This book had some very powerful messages, but there was no break from the darkness. It leaves you feeling depressed, confused and unsatisfied. I didn't hate the book, but I think that is only because I loved the other two books so much. If I would have read it on its own I am not sure I would have finished it. I had to keep putting the book down to take a break from it's over all misery. I give it 3 stars, because I still have no idea how I feel about it.
