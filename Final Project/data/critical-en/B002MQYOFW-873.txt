I had to read this to find out how it all ends but I am really glad that Hollywood is doing a much better job with character development than this author did.  The characters are so flat, I had trouble having sympathy for our heroin, she was not very likable in this book and she didn't do anything for the most part.  It's a lot of sitting around and whining then when the action finally does start it's over in a couple of pages.  When I got to the end I was like &#34;Is that all&#34;  Still if you read the other books or like me wanted to find out how the movie series is going to end you'll probably want to read this.  If you're not that excited about it or you can wait then I suggest waiting for the last movie to come out I'm sure it will be much more interesting than this book.
