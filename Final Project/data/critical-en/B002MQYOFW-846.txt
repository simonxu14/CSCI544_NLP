Whilst enjoyable, the writing remains a bit too simple.  I found lots of easy clich&eacute;s making the series a nice entertaining set of books but lacking compared to classics such as 1984.  More like a thriller than a book with impact, it seems prepped up for the Hollywood movies lacking the true complexity of the human mind with the dichotomy of good and evil being overly reduced to two shades of grey.  Recommend for entertainment value but don't expect great literature nor a deep, interesting message.
