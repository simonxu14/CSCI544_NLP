The first book was amazing, the second was pretty good, but Mockingjay did not live up to expectations.  While it does offer a conclusion to the series, it felt rushed at times, like author was writing an essay and only had so many words to do so.  While this book does offer a conclusion to the series, I thought it was a mediocre end to what was an overall good series.  I recommend it to complete the story, there certainly wasn't a bow on top so to speak.
