Story issues aside, this book doesn't overwhelm you with storyline the way 'The Hunger Games' or 'Catching Fire' did. Maybe it was a poor storyline, maybe not, but its seems like two books were shoved into one, and neither of them was fully developed. I would have loved to have seen 100 more pages at least in order to understand what the heck was going on. The final chapters are incredibly predictable and the finale leaves you wanting. If you need closure to the series, and I did, then go for it. If you weren't wowed by 1 or 2...then let 3 go.
