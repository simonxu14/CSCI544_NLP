You can only take so much of this conspiracy within a conspiracy, and who do I trust sort of thing.  He first book had me on the edge of my seat, and this one had me yearning to get out of my seat, and do something else, anything else.  Heck, it is such a &#34;wonderful&#34; book, I don't even really remember the ending!
