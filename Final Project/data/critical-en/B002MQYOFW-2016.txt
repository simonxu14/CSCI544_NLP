The first book was amazing. The second book was pretty good. This book was horrible. There isn't any real action at all in this book until the end and then when there is it feels rushed. There is no time to soak anything in. People just die fast and Katniss moves on. Katniss herself becomes so frustrating. She teeter totters between taking action and laying around being utterly pathetic. Peeta is so pointless in this book. He doesn't do anything noteworthy and his love for Katniss doesn't make any sense. It seems like he doesn't even really believe it at the end. It just something he does because it seems true. Gale gets a bigger role but I hate how he lets Katniss treat him like crap the whole time but still sticks by her. I did not like the resolution of the rebellion either. It was clear that the rebels were going to replace one corrupt President with another but the way Katniss ended it was so unsatisfying. This book was overall so frustrating that I was glad when it was over.<br /><br />***Spoiler***<br /><br />It was unsatisfying because I wanted Katniss to kill President Snow but she didn't. It felt like it needed to be done by her hands. Her decision to kill Coin made sense but it was unsatisfying.<br /><br />I hated that Katniss voted to continue the Hunger Games in the new government. That was lame. Kind of makes the war pointless. New faces same oppression.<br /><br />The love triangle resolution sucked too. Katniss got off the hook too easy. Gale basically leaves her so she didn't even have to make the choice of choosing Peeta (even though she would have chose him anyway). It took Gale long enough to leave her after she strung him along for three books. Even when Peeta was gone she treated Gale like dirt and showed him no affection whatsoever. It was obvious she would choose Peeta the whole time.
