I am reviewing the product itself rather than the story because chances are you already have heard what a great story it is. Unfortunately the Kindle edition has some major flaws with the formatting. I went with 2 stars instead of 1 because it is readable, but that doesn't mean it is acceptable. The fact that the font size randomly changes from chapter to chapter and sometimes even within a chapter is extremely annoying. I can't understand why Amazon and/or the publisher won't fix this. Its a known issue that has existed for a long time now.
