Somebody suggested I read this book.  They said that if I like sci-fi I should enjoy this book.  So I started to read this book.  After the first page I was thinking, oh my, this is a rip off of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Make-Room-Make-Room/dp/0765318857/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Make Room! Make Room!</a>.  But by the end of the first chapter I realized it was more of a dystopia, but I did not know if it was a self-made one like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Giver/dp/0385732554/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Giver</a>&nbsp;or one forced on mankind from the outside, like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Tripods-Trilogy-The-White-Mountains-The-City-of-Gold-and-Lead-The-Pool-of-Fire/dp/0020425716/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Tripods Trilogy (The White Mountains / The City of Gold and Lead / The Pool of Fire)</a>.  By the time I was a hundred or so pages into the book, it was reminding me of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Running-Man/dp/0451230620/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Running Man</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Battle-Royale-The-Novel/dp/1421527723/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Battle Royale: The Novel</a>.<br />There is really no other way to say this - if you are a writer you need to READ.  That way, when you have an idea you know how to present it in a way that has not been done before.  Or has not been done too many times before.  On top of that, this isn't really Sci-Fi, more like Sci-fantasy.  OK, let us talk about the good points of the book now that the complaints are done.<br />This is a great starting book for a teen who wants to start reading.  If they can get through the first hundred or so pages, they are hooked.  But only if they don't read a lot of Sci-Fi or books to begin with.  Otherwise they are going to notice all the themes and ideas are as old as dirt and not well presented.  If I had been a teen and just starting to read, this may have gotten five stars.<br />And when I mean teens, I really mean teen girls.  It has a touch of romance.  Realistic romance.  But also realistic death scenes.  A weird, interesting mixture of dark fantasy and  blood stained dystopia.  I don't know if I will be getting the other books.  I likely will do so, but I fear that, like many other book series, the stories that follow will just not be as good as the first.
