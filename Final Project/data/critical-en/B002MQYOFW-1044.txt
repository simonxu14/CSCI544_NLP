This book was ok but there's some parts that made me give it 3 stars.I got bored at some parts like when the pages just say katniss did this and that and the day is done.Also the death of finnick was bad because he just died and they just watched and feel no emotion.Prims death was like that to she just died like that and I was confused when she said she was being taken into the ground when prim died and I had no idea what was happening,it was very confusing.
