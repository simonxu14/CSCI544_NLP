Ever since the fourth book it is possible to see that the writter has been making the series more dark, and sad for the poor Harry Potter, he is a boy who suffered alright, apart from losing his parents, and his awful family at Pivet Drive he has seen few happiness besides Hogwarts, but it has been growing more thin.<br /><br />The fourth book has ended sadly, but it was to be expected, however the parts at which we read for are becoming less important at the end of the books(triwizard tournament for one).<br /><br />I believe the whole rebellion thing to be poor explored in this book, and it seems that you have no idea what the book wants to tell just until near the end, and again it ends in tears of the poor Harry Potter, he just doesn't seem to be very lucky right.<br /><br />It feels as this book was just an passage from the fourth to the sixth book, with no real effect on the series, except all the things that Harry has lost, and even when you think that he finally has something good, and BANG he loses it.<br /><br />Overall, good book, but between the others (1-5) it is the worst, and most annoying, I read the 870 pages, and felt that few has passed, and nothing of importance ocurred, maybe the excessive characters this time were the problem.<br /><br />And Cho, damm'it, can' this guy get a little some, not even and girlfriend he deserves???<br /><br />Anyway, now it seems like an fanboy complaint, not so much, it just seems that for Rowling, the maturement needed involved bad things happening non stop.<br /><br />But it is real cool to see the growth of the characters, clearly getting older.<br /><br />3 out of 5 is the top I will give it, hope the sixth one will be better.
