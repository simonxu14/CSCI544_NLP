The first one was good, second okay-this is bad! Second did not impress me, but had to see how it all ended. Guess I dislike it because I don't buy the plot idea; how did Katniss get so important for this revolution? A symbol-just one small girl?? Also, really disappointed with the end. In the three books, Katniss hesitates between Gale and Peeta. I had expected a scene, at least one, all three present, detailing her final choice. Not just a paragraph with her reasoning whom she needs the most.  Also, Katniss mental problems get in the way. Ok, she killed, she was in the arena-but does she have to be this out? It is strange, in such a bright future, they don't have anything to remedy shock and hurt. Nowadays, we have... Well, I guess it comes to the main themes of the books; war is horrible, killing is worse. It made sense when they said Suzanne Collins had been interested in World War three.<br /><br />So, I recommend: read book 1, leave the other two. Suzanne wrote one each year, the last two seem to be written in a hurry.
