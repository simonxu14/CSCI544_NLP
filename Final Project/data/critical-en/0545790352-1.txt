I received this book yesterday. The illustrations in the book are very nice. The cover is nice with embossed lettering. The quality of the book binding however has much to be desired. As soon as I opened the book to the first page, I noticed that the binding of the book was torn away from the pages. This is similar to another reviewer's experience I believe. See pictures of all the problems with the book.
