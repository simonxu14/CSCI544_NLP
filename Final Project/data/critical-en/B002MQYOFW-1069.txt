After watching the second movie, I wanted to finish the series by reading the last book.... not as good as I was hoping for, although it should make an entertaining flick (s)? Why do authors unload all the action in the last third of their novels? Take a clue from Lee Child and keep the action moving thru-out and more readers will benefit.
