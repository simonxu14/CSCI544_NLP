What started as elation over a great first book, really riveting and totally something new has quickly turned to disappointment in this, the last of the Hunger Games Trilogy. My biggest problem with this book was character assassination and feeling that the author completely changed someone's traits to tie the book's loose ends up. Gale, who once passionate but a good person turns into a complete jerk most likely so the author can get us not feeling so torn between Gale and Peeta.<br /><br />Second, Peeta, who has been strong turns into this bumbling weak kitten with almost no personality. He looses his entire persona in this book and is a non-character. Katniss becomes something she never was. The ending is horrible, wrapped up in two pages when it should have taken so much more. Explanations for the ending events are thrown together. I feel like the author got bored in the middle of the second book and the writing and plot died there. So sad because I was really rooting for this trilogy. The movies may be better than the books which I NEVER would say under normal circumstances. Hopefully a great screenwriter can leave me with a better taste in my mouth.
