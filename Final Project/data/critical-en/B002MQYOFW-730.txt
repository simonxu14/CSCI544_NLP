When I bought it, I wasn't aware that it was a book targeted at younger audiences (at least it seems to be).<br /><br />The main characters are 12-18 years old and while the plot is fairly interesting the characters are pretty black and white ... you know who's good and who's bad in the same way as in most Harry Potter books.  The characters are nowhere near as interesting or ambivalent as lets say in Game of Thrones, nor do the plot or the characters take any surprising twists or turns.<br /><br />I'd say it's popcorn fiction. The book does by no means come anywhere near R.R.Martin's books (Game of Thrones) or books written by William Gibson ... neither in complexity/atmosphere nor in their tendency to surprise.  But it is still fairly well written and an easy entertaining read and it has its good moments. Certainly suitable for most teenagers.  Essentially I'm sure, people who are fine with Harry Potter books, will like this one too.<br /><br />Also, if you saw the movie, there's still something for you in the book.  I saw the movie later and found many scenes in the movie which I would not have understood without the book. Naturally a few plot parts were missing from the movie too. So I imagine reading the book after the movie will still have some good moments.<br /><br />If you're still not sure if you should read it, click on the 1-star reviews and sort for most helpful first.  The one by "Alex" sums up the weak part nicely, although personally I think the overall rating is overly critical and harsh.
