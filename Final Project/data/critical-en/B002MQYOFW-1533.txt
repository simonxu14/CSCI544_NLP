My wife and oldest daughter were huge fans of the series. Saw the movie and loved it.  We recently went on vacation and I decided to give Hunger Games a try.  I loved the first 2 novels.  Mockingjay was terrible.  Overly depressing and violent (describing children's body parts after an explosion - really?).  The first 2 were close to pushing the envelop on "Young Adult" novels.  I am an avid reader and have read plenty Stephen King, Clive Barker, Dean Koontz, etc..  This book is one of the most violent I have read.  Plot was rambling.  Main character's self-loathing unbearable.  All I can say is this was really, really bad.  Parents beware if you "Young Adults" are going to read this.
