Others have pointed out this book's weaknesses in detail, so I'm just going to say: the overall feeling I was left with after reading the last word was "Lord of the Rings (Harry carrying the locket all over England) meets The Matrix (Harry and Dumbledore at King's Cross)".<br /><br />Some more specific questions/peeves:<br /><br />* Voldemort not checking Harry's body personally to make sure he is dead? After Harry has escaped him so many times? That fits neither the description of Tom Riddle as an extremely intelligent person nor Voldemort's characterization as the most cunning and powerful evil wizard of all times.<br /><br />* How did Molly kill Bellatrix? I thought there was only one Killing Curse.<br /><br />* Why does neither side ever use Polyjuice Potion, Felix Felicis or Veritaserum to help them in their cause?<br /><br />* If Hermione has a bottomless bag, why did she take all those books and Phineas' portrait - but not enough food and drink, especially since she knew that it is not possible to conjure either?<br /><br />* No closure between Harry and Snape or Harry and Draco - characters who were built up as major opponents, yet simply fizzled out in the end.<br /><br />* The nauseating "happily ever after" epilogue, which read like a bad piece of fan fiction.<br /><br />And some things that were really bugging me all throughout the book:<br /><br />* Luck as a plot device. Every time the friends get into a tight spot, something happens at the last minute and they're magically saved.<br /><br />* Harry's use of Unforgivables.<br /><br />* The whole concept of "wordless magic". Why did the author bother to introduce it when everybody ends up shouting curses all over Book 7?<br /><br />* Death Eaters (grown wizards who are supposedly the big bad guys) being defeated by "Expelliarmus" and "Rictusempra". Riddikulus!<br /><br />All in all I agree with my husband who, upon finishing Deathly Hallows, expressed the opinion that it sounded as if the author was bored with the series and wanted to get it done and over with as quickly as possible.
