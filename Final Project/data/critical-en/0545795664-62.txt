The layout of this book is very strange. The Pokemon are listed in alphabetical order instead of numerical order, so you will not see the evolutions next to one another... this can be very confusing for new players of the game or fans of the show. I was also expecting it to show what level certain moves are learned in the game, but they are just thrown into a list of &#34;possible moves&#34; for each Pokemon. I would not recommend this book.
