Call me old fashioned but I find it disturbing that this book has gained so much popularity with young children, ages 10-13. That's all I could think about while reading it. Children taken away from their homes to participate in a "game" where they kill each other? Seriously, No wonder our world is becoming what it is. I had no interest in book 2 or 3.
