The story is juvenile, but it caught my interest and moved quickly so I read the whole book. But it is so poorly edited that I actually got out my red pencil and started marking it up with proofing marks. I think it is a pity that young people who read this book (it is aimed at teens) will find such a poor example of writing and editing. I cannot recommend this book.
