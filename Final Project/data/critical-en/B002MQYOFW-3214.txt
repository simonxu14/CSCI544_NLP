I loved the movie. I was unable to view the bood I purchased online on my Kindle Fire. I have called seven times since August 24, 2012, The reps I talked to all seemed competent, but when I did what they recommended nothing happened. I had over $125.00 worth of books on my kindle. They are all gone. At this point the only thing my kindle is good for is as a paperweight. I would love some assistance in this matter but I doubt I will get it.
