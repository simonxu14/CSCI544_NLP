Katniss Everdeen is the Mockingjay, appointed by District 13's President Coin. She is the voice of the revolution against the Capitol, President Snow, and the Hunger Games. After all that's happened, there is only one conclusion: war. And it's brutal.<br /><br />No one is spared and nothing is sacred. District 12 is a memory, burnt to rubble by the Capitol. Those who survived are forced underground in District 13, which is not as forgotten as we've been led to believe.<br /><br />Peeta is in the Capitol's grip and Katniss's relationship with Gale is strained by all that's happened between her and Peeta.<br /><br />For me, the love triangle is part of what kept me interested in the series. It's a good thing, too, because Mockingjay is a slow starter.<br /><br />I watched The Hunger Games and Catching Fire on a whim. The first caught my attention and the second held it. Suzanne Collins brought a new world to life for me and though the series is not in a genre I normally read, I was impressed by the ingenuity of the games, the depth of character, and the uniqueness of the traps and gifts.<br /><br />Being that this was my first time in Katniss's head (reading the book instead of watching the movie), I felt disoriented, initially, and for the first forty percent of Mockingjay considered it a lot of unnecessary struggle and whining. The book's pacing was not incredible. Slow to start, mired in grim war scenes, and with a somewhat rushed feel to the ending (and super fast-forward Epilogue), I missed the meat of the story. There were moments of brilliance and the twists caught me unaware. I wished there was more of the strategy and less inner monologue.<br /><br />Peeta and Katniss's love story is what drove me to read the book, and it's what kept me going when the wordiness dragged me down. I wanted more. I wanted to undo some of what the author did because as bleak as the series is, and understandably so, the endings for some of the favorite characters were worse. For me, this concludes a chapter of something I had invested a lot of hours of my life on. Brilliant writer, great series, but, in my opinion, it ends on a low note.
