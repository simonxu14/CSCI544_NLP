I was really looking forward to Mockingjay, maybe too much so, because I was disapointed.  It was really not as good as the first two books.  It was extremely violent.  It did not give you as much information/insight on the new characters.  The characters simply were not developed as well as the first two novels.  The book seemed a bit rushed to get to a conclusion.  I recommend reading it just to get to the conclusion of the trilogy but don't expect the same quality as in the first two.
