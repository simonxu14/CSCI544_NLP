I finished reading this book last night and while I can say in all honesty that I LOVED the first three books, this one left a very bad taste in my mouth.  The character developement is still good, the story line is a  continuation of the other three books, and she did a good job of making the  three main characters seem older.  However, having let my 9 year old  daughter read the first three on her own, there is no way I can let her  read this one by herself.  The cruelty in this one, as well as the graphic  description of a self mutilation, and the thinly disguised comparison of  the The Dark One's followers and Nazi's make me really hesitate to let her  read this one on her own.  The first three books were innocent, this one is  definitely not.
