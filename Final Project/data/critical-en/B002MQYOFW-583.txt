Like many others, I loved the first 2 books but this book fell short of even decent.  Some of the writing went in 3 different directions that I had to stop and re-read a few passages because I was lost.  I felt the middle to the ending were just horrible, did not like the way Collins just killed off characters and made a "heroic Mockingjay" become a diaster.  The relationships were crushed and a big vote at the end with who said "yes" was ridiculous, especially one person. I could go on and on but I won't but will say Suzanne Collins had a great 2 first reads, this one was written, to me, like she HAD to do it and got bored with the story so threw words down on paper to appease the fans.  It is a book for teens so as an adult, maybe what do I know?! I also hope they do not try to create 4 movies out of these 3 books because 2 movies for the final book would not make sense.
