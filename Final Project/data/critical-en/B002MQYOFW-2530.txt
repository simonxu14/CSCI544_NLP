I will not get into reviewing the books themselves, there is plenty of that to go around. However, let me take a minute to say that I believe that the kindle edition, though cheaper than buying the 3 books separately, is annoyingly flawed and basically done without any dedication.<br />The main flaw is that the font size changes every time I advance one chapter. This is really stupid and I have to readjust it every time. I do not know if other people have had this problem, but it has happened to me in two kindles and in my kindle for android too. This is very annoying and I cannot understand how this can happen in such a popular and well selled book. I believe an update on the file is in order, as has happened with other flawed titles.<br />The other thing is the format every time you advance from book to book. There are horrible letters that say END OF BOOK XX with a clearly different font and size of the text. It looks pasted and like nobody proof read it.<br />Also, I would have expected to have the three covers of the books as separation. No such luck. I'd buy the 3 books separately, this is not worth the trouble.
