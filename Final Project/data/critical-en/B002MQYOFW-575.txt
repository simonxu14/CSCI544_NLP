This book was alright although I have to say it was probably the most drug out of the series. It takes nearly half the book just for anything aall that interesting to happen and the intro period was wayy to long causing the end to be very much rushed, No I am not wanting a fairytale or twilight book however, you can't build up all this story just to end it in an emotionless war.<br />  The book however did have great cliffhangers leaving you hanging off every word once you get into it it's just getting to that point that takes forever. Also I feel the ending was very rushed in the last few pages making for a semi cheesy end. I dont think the offer took this book to its full potential yet, it still is a decent finally and I would still recommend it.
