I originally balked at reading this book.  But once I accepted the premise, which was that kids were brought togeether to kill each other for everyone's entertainment, than I was all right with it.<br /><br />I was sort of disgusted by the whole thought, but the story was well written, the characters well defined and developed.  I wasted no time after the story, and went right to the second one.<br /><br />I think that the love story between Peeta and Katniss was a little far fetched.<br />Spoiler alert:  They both win the games.  Didn't happen any other year.  So we can have two star crossed lovers.  Sort of unoriginal of a story line
