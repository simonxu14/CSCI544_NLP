That must be the lamest ending in literature.  Oops, sorry.  The lamest ending in who-cares, just-send-me-my-paycheck fiction.  Collins' ideas are running out by the third book.  But, for most of Mockingjay, she plods ahead anyway.  Then the editor must have called and said, "Yo, Suzanne.  Deadline tomorrow, right?"  Because the last few chapters seem completely out of place and completely unedited.  The characters are different, the style is different, the message is different....  Horrible.  I really enjoyed the first two books.  I am hoping that this cash-me-out, rushed ending doesn't tarnish the memory of them.
