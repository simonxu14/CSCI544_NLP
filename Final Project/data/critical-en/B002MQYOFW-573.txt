^ SPOILERS ^<br /><br />I loved the first two books in this trilogy, but the MockingJay conclusion was disappointing for many reasons.<br /><br />1. Katniss:  The author changed the major character of the book without any hints of what was coming in parts 1 and 2.  It's as if you read a book about Superman and wind up with Clark Kent, only MockingJay  was worse because at least you always knew Clark was Superman's alter ego and Clark also had some gumption. Here, a strong and resourceful Katniss winds up physically and mentally beaten down.  Not only was she unappealing, but there was no foreshadowing of what she was to turn into.<br /><br />2. Deaths:  Many main characters die. OK. But should Prim be killed off in one paragraph.  Should other main characters be disposed of so quickly.  It was ineffective and gave the impression of not being well thought out.<br /><br />3.  The plot:  I actually liked the theme that some of the rebels, especially Coin, mirrored the evils in the Capitol. But I found the end of this plot theme to be murky. Coin's dead, so all of a sudden, everything gets better. How?  It was not particularly believable or developed.  What happens after the revolution is also glossed over in an unsatisfying way.<br /><br />4.  Peeta: This attractive major character is mostly nonexistent in MockingJay.  His mind is so altered that he becomes another person and the person he turns into is not a very strong foil for Katniss.<br /><br />5. Katniss's mother:  She is quickly disposed of at the end without any exploration of her relationship to Katniss.  Unconvincing and unsatisfying.<br /><br />6. Pace of the book:  MockingJay was simply not as fast moving or engrossing as the first two books. It wasn't bad.  I kept wanting to find out what was going to happen, but, especially in parts, it dragged a little.<br /><br />I'm giving this book 3 stars because it did interest me and in many places it was imaginative and original.  It could, though, have been so much better.
