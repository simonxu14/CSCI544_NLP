First of all, I want to start with how much of a huge fan of the Hunger Games trilogy I was.  While I thought the second book was somewhat of an unnecessarily long bridge to gap the first book to the third book, I still found the second book rather enjoyable and read it faster than I read The Hunger Games.  However, I was disappointed to find that what charming attributes that made the first two books were disappointingly lacking in this final book.  Don't get me wrong, I thought Mockingjay was a great read, but it took a turn that I thought digressed way too much from the first two books.<br /><br />***SPOILERS AHEAD******SPOILERS AHEAD******SPOILERS AHEAD******SPOILERS AHEAD******SPOILERS AHEAD******SPOILERS AHEAD***<br /><br />My first real issue with Mockingjay was the regression of Katniss's character.  I understand that characters, especially 'heroes' like Katniss Everdeen are supposed to rise and fall in their character developments, eventually finding their way to their own voice where they can make their own decisions and learn from their mistakes.  Unfortunately, as I completed Mockingjay, I found this not to be the case.  In The Hunger Games, Katniss is more relatable to audiences.  It's clear that she is distrustful of those around her, as she is put into a position where she must fend for her own in order to win the games.  However, she eventually learns to trust those around her, starting with Rue, and then eventually learning to trust (and manipulate) Peeta.  After the first two books, I had hoped that Katniss would eventually learn to value the people around her and learn to trust those who are willing to die for her.  But that is not at all the case.  Katniss stays as the reclusive, distrustful, and manipulative tribute from the first book.  In fact, she becomes so unlikeable that I found myself wishing that by the end of the book something horrific would happen to Katniss and she would die die DIE just so I wouldn't have to hear her whine whine whine about how horrible her life is (at this point I'd like to point out that her family, aside from Gale's were pretty much the only one who got out SAFELY from District 12 after it got bombed.  yes, Katniss, your life is SOOOOO horrible that you were rescued from the Games with your family in tact, and all you can bitch about is how horrible your life is without your dead father.  Let's all keep in mind that you're not the one being tortured and being forced to watch everyone else you know die before your very eyes.).<br /><br />Putting my rant for Katniss aside, I felt that Suzanne Collins failed to develop Katniss's character completely.  Katniss remains selfish and really only thinks about herself and her troubles before thinking about others.  As many other reviewers before me have pointed out, she only comes to Peeta's aid like 3 times out of the countless times she considers killing him.  Where is the compassion that she seems to spew in her mind but never seems to show to others.  From what I've noticed, Katniss only really ever mourns when people she loves are taken away from her.  Whenever she's with Gale or with Peeta, or even her mother and sister, she seems to take them for granted when they are present.  I suppose Collin's attempt to force Katniss into this realization was to kill her sister.  But even then Katniss does not seem to learn from her mistake, but is rather hellbent on spilling more blood in order to reach some kind of satisfaction for her sister's death.  Although I wasn't exactly opposed to the ending, since I will admit I enjoyed it (nothing wrong with a fairy tale ending), I was a bit disturbed thinking I would've actually preferred Katniss remain alone and empty after regressing from a passive Mockingjay to a soulless mutt.<br /><br />But I digress (I could say so much more, but I'll spare the boring rants).  I want to move on to my next point, which is Suzanne Collins's sudden change in narrative.  I was so disappointed having to pretty much skim through so many parts in the book as I found much of the action scenes and the Call of Duty-esque battles seem to drag on and on in the book.  After awhile I found no sense of suspense after realizing that no major characters would really be killed off as all the other uncountable, insignificant characters like Leeg 1 and Leeg 2 (brilliant, no?) were offed in deaths that had to just one up the next one.  After managing to get through all of that, I felt cheated when Collins decided to not even show us anything at the end.  She built everything up about Snow's death, only to have her pretty much tell her everything that happens after Prim's death.  We don't see what happens to Snow.  We're told he may have been trampled.  We don't see the transfer of power from Capitol, District 13, and then to the 'people'.  We're told about that as well.  In fact, I feel like Collins' pretty much gave up describing it out to us and pretty much had to spell everything out to us, as if our brains to turned to mush just like Katniss' and Peeta's.  Instead of allowing us to interpret things for ourselves and figuring things through character actions, we get chunks of paragraphs of Katniss telling us what things mean (like the Hanging Tree poem that had to be so thoroughly broken down for us there was pretty much nothing left to the imagination) and what important things have transpired.  I felt like this was a huge cop out on the author's part.  Having taken part in Katniss' journey from the first book to the third, only to have the climatic and most crucial scenes be told to us in a brief paragraph, I was utterly disappointed and wished that I had just read the first book of this trilogy and then left everything else an open ended question.<br /><br />On to the POSITIVE STUFF!!!  As much as I have so much stuff to rant about, I'm going to end with the very brief and tacked on ending.  Although as much as I despised Katniss by the end of the book, I felt that she eventually learns from her mistakes and develops her character...slightly.  After all, she finally acknowledges Peeta and opens her heart to him and even grows to have a family.  However, as previously mentioned we are never really shown this, but rather told.  Even so, I can't help but think back to Gale's assessment of Katniss choosing whoever she can't survive without.  She eventually accepts Peeta only because she learns that Gale is perhaps way too much like her, and the only way she can salvage her empty character is to fill it with the only positive element left in her life.  So maybe she doesn't grow as much as I would have liked, but perhaps this is a step to progression to show that over time Katniss is able to transform from mutt to subhuman.
