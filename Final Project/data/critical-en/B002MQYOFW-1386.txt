I jumped on the bandwagon with this one and, while I can't say I was disappointed in the story overall, I did feel by the end of it that I was just finishing it to finish it. I'd rather stopped caring about most of the main characters by that point and the excellence of writing had significantly diminished since the descriptive and gripping passages of the first book.
