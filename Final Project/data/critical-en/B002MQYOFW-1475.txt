The Katniss you grew to love and admire is nothing more than a crazed crack head, a self-loathing morphling addict.  Peeta spends most of the book in tracker-jacker withdrawal, and Gale indirectly had a hand in killing dozens of innocent children.  Do yourself a favor: stay away from this book and hold on to the fond memories you have from Books 1 & 2.
