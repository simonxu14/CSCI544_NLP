Without getting into too many spoilers, I will say that I loved Hunger Games and adored Catching Fire. Suzanne Collins returns with the third book in the series with Mockingjay - a book I wanted to love. In reality it's just okay. The storyline takes a hard right turn from the previous two books, which took place in the competitive field of the Hunger Games. I get a sense that Collins was running out of ideas when she wrote this book. Some of it is just plain silly, and most of it is boring. In addition, after creating what I thought was a very interesting character in Katniss Everdeen, Collins seems to loose her grasp on the principle of the story to the point she's not very likable. If you're read the first two books and are invested in the characters, you may as well read it. If you aren't too hot about the first two books, I'd skip this one.
