With just about everyone on the plane and at the pool reading this book I had to give it a try.  I could not put it down.  HOWEVER,  it  is much too violent for children.  The premise of children killing children desensitizes young minds and reminds me of the senseless killings between gang members.  It is as bad an influence as violent  video games.  Also, it promotes an anti-authority viewpoint reminiscent of the 60's and the current anarchist movement.  With that caveat I must say that, as a mature adult, I found it a fast-paced, original work and was even impressed with the resilience of its lead female character.  Recommend for adults only.
