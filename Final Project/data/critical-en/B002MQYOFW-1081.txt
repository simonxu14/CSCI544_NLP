The Hunger Game Trilogy is grand. I was always interested what was happening on the next page. The hardship that Katniss had been out through and never was released from always being exposed to a hardship life was way to hard to know coming to the end and only having a few pages to tell that she turned out okay.This is a good read for those who are able to keep an open mind.
