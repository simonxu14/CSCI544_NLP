These books are awesome! However, if you want to buy them for your Kindle then I strongly recommend buying the ebooks individually. As others have said, the font sizes changed randomly (and even the options would change so I couldn't get it back to the same size I was reading yesterday..?). Also, I thought I was buying the set of three books as individual Kindle files but this is one big file. Some people may like that, but I'd rather not have to go into a table of contents to choose which book to look at. But again, the books are great so far!!
