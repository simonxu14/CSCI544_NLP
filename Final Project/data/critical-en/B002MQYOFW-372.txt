Well, after reading the first two books in this series, I had high hopes for a strong ending and I honestly didn't get it.... Too many times, the author took the easy way out in this book by the main character always being hurt and missing some big points of action. Then the ending, really? Can Collins be ok with ending the series this way. Now, maybe my feelings were made to be this way by Collins on purpose, and that's cool...but, compared to the first two, this book just let me know in more ways than one.
