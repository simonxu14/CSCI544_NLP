I have bought sveral kindle books I do not recommend purchasing this set. It was constantly resetting to the beginning of the first book while reading for no apparent reason it would also reset reading progress and book marks. Because of these issues I began to note the page location so I could return to where I was, every other time I did this however it would give me an error message saying if I had purchased this item I needed to delete it and download it from the cloud again and was the only way to continue reading. This happened upwards of 30 to 40 times and luckily I was at home so I could easily get on wifi and redownload. The series itself is amazing and left me very satisfied the Hunger Game books are well written and captivating. I hope they fix the errors however that plague the kindle edition.
