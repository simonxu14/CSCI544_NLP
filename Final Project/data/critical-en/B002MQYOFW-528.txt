*WARNING SPOILERS*<br /><br />I really loved the first two books in this trilogy and expected this one to be amazing. It is the end after all and the end is always the best part of a book. I actually loved it all, until I got to the end (ironic right?). I really liked Gale's character in the first two books but then Collins just decides to make him a creep in the end. She then goes further and makes Katniss like Peeta. Really? He wants to kill you. And you decide that you love him now of all times? I feel like I just read a hipster's diary. She made the end the opposite of what I thought, hoped, and wanted. The only reason I gave this book two stars is because of the previous two books. I actually had several people come and tell me, "don't read that book. You'll want to kill Katniss by the end."I just thought they were psyching me out but no. They were telling the truth. So if there is one thing you take from my review, just don't read the book. Or you can do what I did and make up your own ending where Katniss gets the guy of her dreams (Gale, not Peeta), everyone stays alive, and that all live happily ever after. I know its cliche but I can't help it, I'm only human. Everyone likes a happy ending. Except Suzzane Collins apparently.
