It's Battle Royale and Romeo and Juliet in one wich I find interesting. It's not original or anything but I can work with this...<br /><br />My problem with this book's Katniss voice.<br /><br />I mean, the writting is awful. You can't write in the first person and show your main character's defects and virtues like they are complete self aware of their souls. That's not how people's mind work, even selfish teenagers with high self aware don't express themselves like that. Ok, they can talk like that because we humans coul be little shits when we talk but when we think? And Katniss is mostly a silent girl.<br /><br />Yet, even if people think about themselves like that, that's not how a book works. We should understand the main character for what they do not what they think of themselves if not that, what's the fun in reading?<br /><br />Plus, how could I have read a post apocalyptic teen thinking you have to be married to have kids? The book's is rated for teens, right? Explain me how Panem destroyed the Church but still they are all &#34;we wait until marriage&#34;? Somebody tell me it's just Katniss living inside a tupperwere and in perpetual denial.<br /><br />I'm trying to finish the book... really because the second movie was nice and the actors made a better job than the novelist. I can't believe I said &#34;the movie is better than the book&#34;...
