What a disappointment!! The first two were filled with hope with a wonderful, strong main character in Katniss. This book is depressing and tragic. It's such a completely different turn from the first two I feel lied to. This book is a tragedy so if you like them - then enjoy. If you aren't prepared for a constantly depressing, tragic book then don't waste your money. What a grand disappointment. I'll think twice and will read all negative reviews for any other books that Suzanne Collins has written or writes as I don't trust her as an author.
