I read the first three books straight through with delight, and the fourth in two days with less delight but also great appreciation.  This book was a huge disappointment for me.  Harry is sullen and angry in a way that doesn't quite fit with his previous books. Unlike reviewers who have said he had more depth, he actually seemed much more stereotyped, two dimensional and unrealistic.  Plus, the whole formula for each book keeps repeating -- this book lacked originality, humor and intrigue of other books.  I'm starting to tire of endless battles with Voldemort that don't change anything.  The thought of having to read TWO more installments of this before it ends is very unappealing!  What I enjoyed most in earlier books was the genuine friendship and development between Harry, Ron and Hermione, along with major characters.  The sweetness and humor they brought.  Now I'm finding the characters more annoying and unsympathetic (especially Harry).  The death in this particular book also seemed shocking and unecessary for plot purposes, unless the point is to make Harry as miserable and victimized as possible.  I worry that the commercialization of all these books and the subsequent movies that lacked the wit and cleverness of the early books are leading the whole series in a more depressing and unoriginal direction.
