The International Quidditch Cup, the Triwizard Tournament, and a touch of evil.  This volume was over 700 pages of dark, nasty reality.  People die, there is racism and scenes that remind me a tad of Nazi Germany.  I can't help it, I work at the Holocaust Museum in DC.  Fantasy sometimes has danger, in the forms of dragons and demons, but the Death Eaters remind us of real problems and dangers we face just being human.  Maybe it's a good thing, a way to bring children who read the series into the real world that they live in?  It certainly adds a touch of realism to the series - but I don't want realism in my fantasy, thank you.  This book tries crossing from the field of fantasy into that of horror.<br /><br />If you liked the movie the book IS better - more details, better character development and even more history of the magical school that is Hogworts.  Also it starts touching on the links between the characters - friendships seem to be turning into romances.
