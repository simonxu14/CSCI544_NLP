I liked Hunger Games a lot.  I liked Catching Fire less.  I didn't like Mockingjay at all.<br /><br />I might have liked the development of the trilogy more if the author hadn't told all three stories from Katniss' viewpoint.  Because the problem is that Katniss disintegrates as a person in the course of the three books, and the story disintegrates with her.<br /><br />In the first book, she does things.<br /><br />In the second book, things are done to her.<br /><br />In the third book, she is a complete mess as a result of the things she has done and the things that have been done to her.<br /><br />Is this realistic?  Probably.  Does it make for good storytelling?  No.<br /><br />I don't really object to Katniss developing PTSD.  After what she's been through, it would have been surprising if she didn't.  And I don't object to her being caught up in things she doesn't understand. She's a young person dealing with older people in positions of power.  It's to be expected.<br /><br />But if an author's going to take a character in this direction -- basically, having her diminish in each book -- it would be better not to tell the whole story from her viewpoint.  It might have been better if each book's story had been told from a different viewpoint -- maybe Katniss for Hunger Games, Finnick for Catching Fire, and Gale for Mockingjay.
