What happened? I waited months for this book. Were was the captivating story that kept readers on edge like book 1 and 2. Maybe the pressure to complete this great story was to much. This book was a bunch of planning and over detailed story about nothing. Where is the action, the great plots, the great ending? I mean it wasn't completely terrible but if this was going to be the ending I'd of stopped at book two. Hopefully, Collins readers influence will encourage her to do this book over.
