The first book was brutal, but gripping. The second was almost chapter for chapter a simple clone of the first, and therefore dissatisfying but I had a hope the third wpuld save the series. It doesn't. Katniss turns into a self obsessed little snot who is impossible to symathise with, while you the reader are screaming at her to get a grip and turn into that heroine that all expect her to be. Spoiler alert: she doesn't.
