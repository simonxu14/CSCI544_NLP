From all the hype about Hunger Games, one might expect this book to rate among futuristic classics.  It does not, at least for me.  Don't get me wrong, it was a fairly good read.  The author does a pretty good job of making you feel overall contempt for the "Capital" and sympathy for residents of the "Districts".  Unfortunately, that's about all there is except for the underlying development of a teenage romantic stress.  Reasonably entertaining - but not really my cup of tea.
