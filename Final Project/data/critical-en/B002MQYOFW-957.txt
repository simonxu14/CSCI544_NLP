The book / story was good although at first I found it very depressing. Later on though, I looked at it as the spirit of survival and resistance against unfair oppression is part of the human spirit.<br />The one thing I do not like about this series, is that it is written in the first person. I hate books written in that format, unless you are writing an autobiography, a diary, or a blog. It doesn't work for me as a fiction.
