The story was great; however, the service was awful. The book stopped at chapter 36. One turned the page to finish the book and found themselves back on page 691, chapter 34. The ending and final outcome of the entire series was not in this copy, and I have returned your piece of crap. The book was listed at Amazon's Online Used Bookstore, sold by a subsidiary company of Amazon.com eligible for Amazon Prime in Acceptable Condition. I would have expected better of Amazon. A book that leaves out the ending is not "accaptable" by anyone's stretch of the imagination. Unfortunately, I could only return this crap and not exchange it for a real book.
