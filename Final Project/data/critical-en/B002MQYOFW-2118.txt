I watched the first movie before reading these books (and thought it was pretty bad, for the record, haha).  I believe the first book is better than the movie.  But that's still not saying a lot, honestly.  There are some good parts, and the plot's not that bad.  But the writing just dragged on, the relationships just didn't connect (poor character development, I think), and some sections and explanations were so far-fetched, it was hard to accept them in the story.<br />I can see people getting into these books -- but it's odd that the teenage audience it was written for is being subjected to murdered teenagers for adult pleasure.  In the end, it's an OK trilogy, but it could have been a lot more.
