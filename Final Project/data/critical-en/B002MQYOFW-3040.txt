The thought of killing teenage kids in a game sickens me. Even if it is just a story. To think  how this is accepted so widely as the best book since Harry Potter shows  the dumbing down of society. No compassion for  your  fellow man dying. Not like the paint ball hunting game but taking a life and the public is eating it up. Give me a break.
