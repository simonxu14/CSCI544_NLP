honestly, with all the build up of the two previous books, you would think that the writer would know how to tie up the ending nicely.  but this was the worst possible ending to a trilogy and almost seemed rushed and not thought out.  disppointing and will honestly have people going "what?" by the end.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT, so dont read on..<br /><br />3 pivotal characters are met with quick and wasted endings... the reader is left wondering why, like i was.
