I feel a little deflated after reading The Hunger Games.  Perhaps it was all the reviews gushing about this being the best book they've ever read, or thought provoking, or emotionally engaging that built this up to a point it couldn't possibly live up to.  Or the opposite reviews going on and on about the brutality and graphic violence.  Again, I don't quite get it.  Perhaps the only books these others read are fairy tales with happy endings because I didn't find it even close to the most violent, brutal, or graphic book I've ever read.  Certainly nothing most people, the YA audience included, haven't already read or seen on television or in movies or video games.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it was okay.  It wasn't a bad read.  But it's certainly not the most engaging book I've ever read.  I had trouble relating to the main character so I never really felt like I was engaged in the story.  I found Peeta and Rue much more relatable.  I liked it enough that I will probably read the sequels, but I'm not in a hurry to do so.  Maybe I would have given it more than 3 stars if I hadn't read all the glowing reviews first - but I did and frankly, I expected more.
