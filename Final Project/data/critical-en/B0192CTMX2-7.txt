I eagerly read the DH in one night and was left wondering why I had waited two years for this. It isn't a bad book, it just could have been better. The book had a different feel to it that the other 6 didn't have, perhaps because it wasn't set at Hogwarts. The end of the sixth book made it sound like Ron and Hermione would be joining Harry at his Aunt and Uncle's house with him (which didn't happen) and I was curious as to why Mrs. Weasley was so against Ron joining Harry when she had to have realized from past experiences that Harry would need help with his 'quest'.<br /><br />Don't even get me started on the epilogue. That was the biggest let down of all. JK spent the last two books making a big deal about Harry preparing for life after Voldemort and didn't even have the decency to let us know what he did for a living or even try to let us know what life for Harry was like without the constant battles to stay alive. I realize that marriage and kids are an important part of life but that doesn't define who a person becomes.<br /><br />All in all, I loved the first 6 books but I have a feeling that I won't be bothering to re-read this one.
