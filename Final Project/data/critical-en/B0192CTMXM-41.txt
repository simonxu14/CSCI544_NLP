Of course I love the Harry Potter series, which is the only reason I don't want a refund because I want to read the book too badly. I'm rating it so low because when I got the book it was in terrible condition, and I won't be buying from this seller again. It has water damage, yellow pages and a bent cover, not to mention it smelled funny. The Harry Potter series itself is excellent though.
