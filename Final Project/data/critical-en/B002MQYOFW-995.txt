I couldn't put down the first two books, I was obsessed with them!<br />This one wasn't as exciting or fast paced. It's kind of boring..too much plotting and politics and not as much edge of your seat action. Still a good read and the characters still continue to develop and I love seeing that! Of course the love story is still there. I haven't been able to finish it yet, I'm about halfway done but it has taken me twice as long to get here then to finish both the others!
