While not a terrible book, I did not find this novel to be that entertaining. I held off reading it amidst the movie hype as I figured it was a mindcandy sort of read and I really did not want yet another cheap paperback book cluttering my already cluttered bookshelves. However, with the Kindle app on my tablet I was willing to give it a go in a digital format (which was actually very well done).<br /><br />The Hunger Games was not a bad book, but it's really not a good book either. Set in a dystopic future where the country has fallen apart and been rebuilt as a totalitarian state, the book has an interesting setting. 'The Capitol,' which sounds like West Hollywood relocated to Denver or Aspen, demands a tribute of children from subject territories and then makes the kids fight each other to the death.<br /><br />It's an interesting setting, but is executed with clunky prose and a  predictable plot. From the first few pages, you have a pretty good idea which characters will survive and that the status quo will be shaken up in the process. I suppose the target market is young adults in their tween years, so perhaps they will enjoyful the color descriptions of the capitol and the "Running Man" premise which Collins has repackaged for children. The melodramatic moments of death and separation seemed forced and campy to me, but a younger audience might appreciate it more.<br /><br />Parents should feel okay in letting their children read this. I did not find the book to be that disturbing even though it is about... well, children murdering each other. But if parents are looking to give their children a taste of good, accessible science fiction tales, I would recommend Ender's Game or The Giver far more than these books. Now those are classics.<br /><br />I would give this book 2.5 stars if I could. But I can't quite bring myself to give it three. If you're interested in this book, read it now. Because in a few years (after the sequels have been made into movies) no one will really care anymore. Mass market fiction at it's best and worst.
