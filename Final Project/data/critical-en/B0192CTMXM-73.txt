I love JK Rowling, and I love Harry Potter.  But this book was a heartbreaking mess.  The 'Hallows' and the Peverells? Unnecessary distractions.  The 'put-outer' returning Ron to the campsite?  Nonsense.  The Weasleys living free?  Unbelievable.  So much was wrong with the book, it ruined all that was right.  At the end, I was dissatisfied with the epilogue.  We've been suffering for years with these characters, now we're cheated out of the happily ever after that we've earned.<br />I've heard JKR may put together an encyclopedia containing an in-depth epilogue, I really hope she does.  Something sweet to take this bitter taste from my mouth.<br /><br />I guess we all had our theories as to what would happen in Book 7, and we do get very attached to the characters, and make the stories 'our own'. That said, I knew anything could happen, and I really enjoyed the book until after the wedding. (The high point of excitement was Kingsley's patronus!! Loved that.)<br /><br />After that it just got SOOOO dark. I understand JKR was telling a war story, and good people die sometimes fighting for a worthy cause. Point well taken. I got the point with the Potter's deaths. I got the point with the Longbottoms. With Cedric. With Sirius. Dumbledore. Moody. Hedwig. Dobby. Ted Tonks. JKR went on to kill Snape, Colin & Dennis Creevey, Lupin, Tonks, and Fred before she got it all out of her system. That's in addition to Bones, Vance, Abbot, Scrimgeor, etc. Enough's enough! I wanted to send Deathly Hallows back to the kitchen, like a soup with too much salt.<br /><br />The 'Hallows' just felt contrived...a way to get JKR out of several corners she'd written herself into. The Horcruxes (a wickedly cool concept) were set up over five books!!! The Peverell story came out of thin air. I kept thinking "Funny that Dumbledore didn't mention any of this." The second half of the book felt like JKR improvising, and wondering what the heck she was gonna do next. Rather like Harry in the woods!!!<br /><br />As to feeling cheated....yeah, I did. You, me and everybody else have been following Harry down toilets, through fire, Inferi, Dementors, and death for ten years. Dang it, we deserved an invite to Harry & Ginny's and Hermione & Ron's weddings! I wanted to see George okay without his twin. I wanted the foursome, with Neville and Luna, kicking back and clinking butterbeers together.<br /><br />So yeah, I really do hope JKR can give us a warm and fuzzy look at the Potters soon.
