First off, I would like to praise Suzanne Collins' first two books..."The Hunger Games" and "Catching Fires". These two books generates constant suspense and just kept me up at night to read til the very end. So I was very excited to read "Mockingjay", the final book of the series. But what a big disappointment this last book turn out to be!! My sisters are a fan of this series, too, and they were also very disappointed by the final book. The story was so slow paced. And many of the storylines in there are repetitive and irrelevant.. just in there to drag the story longer. I am so glad to finally get this book over with and move on to another more exciting and interesting book!!
