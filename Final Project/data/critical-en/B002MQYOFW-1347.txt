Disgusted; this is the dominant emotion I am left with at the end of this beautiful series. Three stars because I was invested in the characters, however, nearly two stars because I wanted to chuck it in the trash afterwards.  I suggest sticking with the first book (which I loved) and hope the screenwriters can fix the mess in the movies.<br /><br /> **<br />**Spoilers**<br />**<br /><br />I understand that Collins wanted to portray war as being a horrible event where everyone comes away with scars; however, I feel bludgeoned by it.  The finesse of the first book is completely destroyed, along with Katniss.<br /><br />What is good is that I wanted to reach the end; I was interested in the futures of the characters.<br /><br />What was not good is that the ending was weak and at least the last half of the story was deeply flawed.  As one of those that fell in love with Katniss, I wanted my voice heard in the dialogue, as well as her own; Katniss was mentally incapacitated for most of the book, and none of the multitudes that supposedly loved and followed her were given a voice.  I can handle heartache and tragedy, and it is certainly true that anything can break; however, the only thing really broken is this story.<br /><br />Skip this one.
