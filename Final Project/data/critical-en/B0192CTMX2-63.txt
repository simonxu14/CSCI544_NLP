the story itself was fie. the book itself, however was terrible. i had several pages where there bottom half was just pure black. the ink had smeared and half the page was blacked out. of course, i didn't realize this for a while since i bought the series and started from book one. it was too late to return. go buy it somewhere, where you can see the pages and make sure you're not missing half the pages due to black ink.
