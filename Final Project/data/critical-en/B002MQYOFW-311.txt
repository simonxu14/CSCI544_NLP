I could anticipate where the plot would progress and often put the book down to read something else.  Questions from friends and their kids made me renew the effort.  Also, the end rushed to a long term outlined conclusion.<br /><br />There was good character development.  I would not mind reeading a follow-up book (please, no trilogy) based on a less prominate character at the end of Hunger.
