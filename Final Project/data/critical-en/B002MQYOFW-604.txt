Like the other reviewers...the last book of the Hunger Games trilogy was not the best.  I loved the first 2 books, but the last one...it just kept going and going with no end in sight.  And when it did end, I was a bit disappointed.  It wasn't the worse book I've ever read...but I expected more since the first 2 were so good.
