Well I read all three books in about four days. I figured that everyone is talking about the Hunger Games before the movie comes out that I should probably read the book first. While Collins has a written voice I'm not terribly fond of, I did love book 1. Book 2 was pretty good as well. But this book was a disaster imo.<br /><br />The problems were numerous.<br />1. Since Collins can't kill off the Big 3(Katniss, Gale, or Peeta) anywhere except the end, but lots of people need to die, she resorts to a cheap tactic. She introduces us to lots of new characters (a few from book 2) and then proceeds to rapidly kill them off.<br /><br />2. The depiction of the war is contrived and doesn't end in any realistic way.<br /><br />3. Lots of showing and not telling. Huge parts of the book were just boring.<br /><br />4. The description of the Capitol as a big arena with lots of 'pods' for gamemaker/defenders to use reminded me of a couple Dr. Who episodes and Tim Allen in Galaxy Quest. It was just silly -- a street that is really a trapdoor to a cavern of man-eating monsters/mutts. Please. It was insulting to me as a reader.<br /><br />5. Katniss' mom is an afterthought and Prim, a 14 year old girl, is thrust onto the very front lines of the Capitol invasion. It seemed very arbitrary.<br /><br />6. The whole 'let's go kill Snow' storyline was pointless and seemed like a vehicle for Collins to kill off the largest number of characters.<br /><br />7. The reasons for the assassination of Coin were left unexplained and the reader needed to infer everything. The aftermath was also totally unreal.<br /><br />Most wars take years to play out, but in Collins world the Capitol crumpled relatively quickly. Plus the fact that the war was between two nuclear powers (the Capitol & District 13) is brushed aside. The Capitol & District 2 against Every other district & District 13. The use of nuclear weapons is removed by her statement along the lines of 'we'll fight it out the old fashioned way on the ground so no one uses those terrible weapons.' Uh ok.<br /><br />In reality, the Capitol would have used their advanced weapons since the alternative was mass executions by the victors. Also, the Capitol apparently has vast abilities to manipulate DNA and other genetic technology, but no mention of use of biological weapons was made. Finally in book one it's mentioned that one reason the Capitol won the first rebellion was because the rebels had to scale the mountains to reach the capitol and were picked off from the air. In book three they just walk up the train tracks under the mountain. Why didn't the capitol just BLOW THE TUNNELS UP.<br /><br />Then we get to the whole 'The capitol is just a huge arena' nonsense. So in the 75 years since the first hunger games the capitol just decided to make the city a big arena. Yea right.<br /><br />Finally the book was just boring too often with extensive exposition. It just wasn't enjoyable to read like the first or second book.<br /><br />I didn't expect a fairytale ending, but I did expect some realism. The street trapdoor to the bugs of death at the very end was just the last insult I could bear.<br /><br />A very weak book. If they actually go ahead and make a movie out of it they'll have to practically re-write it.
