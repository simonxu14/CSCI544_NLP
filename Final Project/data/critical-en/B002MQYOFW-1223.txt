Hype is what it is for I strongly think that Suzanne Collins had a wonderful, amazing idea but could not deliver. Now I say that about the entire SERIES because the first book, The Hunger Games is brillant. I loved the first book.<br /><br />The second one I forced myself through purely on hope and a false sense of 'it will get better! Just give it a chance!'<br /><br />And the last one I feel like she didnt even try. It was told completly in the past tense! The entire series went from unbeliveable plot, characters, storyline, adventure and love (I have my bone to pick with the love bit but I'll keep it to myself) to...nothing. There was so much she could have done with the ending, yes I understand that war can take its toll and break the best of us but the Katniss she made us love just dissapears.<br /><br />I do recomend people reading the Hunger Games though, but stop about 10 pages before the end of the first book.
