There's very little I can say about this book that hasn't already been complained about a dozen times over. However, there were some things that really bothered me more than others.<br /><br />First off, there's Finnick's demise, written in such a way that I had to go back and reread it a few times to make sure that's really what happened. Very unceremonious, and the reactions were not believable. The fact that Annie seems relatively calm is unsettling, to say the least.<br /><br />Katniss's mother not visiting her reeks of a woman who has completely abandoned her eldest child, but it didn't happen then, no, it happened years before and Prim was the last thing holding her family together. Frankly, I don't see why she wouldn't try harder to stay by her side at that point, since Katniss takes after her father so much.<br /><br />Prim's death made little sense. They were thinking of training her to be a doctor. She was essentially already a nurse. She was not military material and yet they toss her in with the medics. I'm sorry, but even field medics have to be up to military standards.<br /><br />Actually, pretty much the only death that had any thought written into it was Boggs. All the others I couldn't bother to care about because I can't bring myself to believe they're dead when their finales were that poorly written.<br /><br />And most of all, what irked me most was not the choice for Katniss's partner, but the lack thereof. Gale essentially completely abandons her, which makes little sense if he loved her as much as it hints. I try to justify in my mind that he probably desired her for the reason of not wanting someone to steal his hunt, his game. He noticed her as a love interest when someone else was hitting on her, he only thought about telling her when she was being taken away (And he still failed at that), and he only ever did something about it when she is involved with another guy, whether it was fake or real. No matter what the reasons, he could not have loved her that much if he so readily drops her for a shiny, fancy job in 2. Though I suppose them becoming less close was already pretty obvious from the second book.<br /><br />I do, however, admit that Peeta's hijacking made things more interesting.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the actual end did not bother me. Sometimes, a broken person can only ever cling to someone equally broken, as that is the only kind of person who could understand them.<br /><br />I don't even mind Katniss running off and hiding all the time, I just wish some of the parts were better written. There was so much that I didn't understand because of poor wording.<br /><br />There were, however, some parts that brought a chuckle or even a laugh. Like Finnick posing in his underwear and the resulting comment from Boggs.
