I was engrossed in the story line of the first two books. And eager to devour every word of the third. However, this installment felt rushed. And the ending was well, just lame. I get that she could not end up with  Gale, but the way in which Katniss ended up stuck in the burned out shell of District Twelve pumping out children she did not want was just a shame. Again, the whole thing just felt like the author just wanted to be done with it and not take the time to think any of it through. Every thing before was brilliant.
