I liked the first book in the series, though I feel it's flawed. I was more or less neutral on the second one. This one, I actively dislike.<br /><br />The chief virtue of the first book was Katniss herself - strong, independent, stubborn, and competent. By this book she's badly damaged, powerless, in an increasingly dumb romantic situation, and a puppet for the adults around her. She doesn't seem to understand the situation well enough to rebel - in fact, in the last third of the book she agrees to take the training to be a good little soldier, despite the ludicrousness of throwing someone through a one-month basic training course to make them a useful part of a complex urban warfare action.<br /><br />And... she's not. She gets people killed, she hides, she gets blown up. She doesn't do a single useful thing in the climax of the book, until the last symbolic but badly oversimplified choice. It's rage-inducing, especially because there's one scene earlier in the book where she really seems to get it, understand what value she brings and what changes have to happen, but after that scene she seems to forget all of that and goes along with the flow, to tragic effect.<br /><br />It's relentlessly dark, depressing, and ultraviolent, and doesn't seem to know how to follow its own internal morality. There's a good book somewhere in here, but it's buried deep.
