I read all three books together .Wasnt even aware of the Hunger games trilogy until the movie came out .Liked the first book a lot obviously and then the second one even though slow in the beginning was still pretty good .<br />The third one is just terrible ,Its one of the worst books ive ever read !! .Firstly it drags throughout most of the book with no meaning or purpose .Secondly the plot is absolutely ridiculous .<br />I suppose Collins tried to make the whole thing realistic for a 17 year old girl and not say some kind of fictional story about a super -hero like say Harry Potter but its supposed to be fiction!<br />In the first book Katniss  volunteers herself to save her sisters life ,not only does she fail -it renders the first two books moot and makes a mockery of the whole series .<br />Katniss is basically painted as an angry ,confused ,drugged young girl throughout the book ,her mission was plain futile and in the end turned out to be just a suicide mission for both Katniss and all her dear ones ,why her sister would be killed makes no sense ,Peeta in the end served no purpose by coming along .<br />I think Collins just ran out of ideas(since she had no more hunger games) and just tried to finish the book .She should have taken her time instead of throwing up absolute garbage like this .<br />Really a pity ,Collins basically ruined the whole franchise with the last book .
