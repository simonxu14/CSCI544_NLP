Beautiful item. Gorgeous illustrations.  I only gave this a 3 star because of the condition of the book when it arrived. Several pages had come unglued from the binding. I was disappointed, especially because this was a gift and shipping it back and waiting on a replacement would have taken too long. So I improvised and used my glue gun to stick the pages back in. My friend loved the book and the pages are still glued in as far as I know.
