I enjoyed the first 2 books & wrote reviews for both, but this one I can honestly say I hated, & everything other reviewers have written regarding why they didn't like it I can fully relate to. I felt like I had been sucker punched when I got to the final pages & was quite depressed. For half the book Katniss was either sedated or recovering from something, & yet still she went to battle. In the end she was just a Pawn & repeatedly betrayed. Too may loose ends & unexplained conclusions. I wasn't convinced that Katniss truly loved Peeta & it was a match made in heaven, more like to 2 damaged, unstable, dysfunctional people who ended up with one another because really, what was the alternative?<br />I didn't buy in to Gale just leaving, he was her rock, he saved her family & they had a strong bond, at least that's what we were led to believe. Prim's death was totally unnecessary, & their mother just leaving to go to another district when her daughter "The Mockingjay" was so fragile..please! The final pages which were supposed to sum up Katniss & Peeta's life together seemed like a rushed attempt to get the book to print.
