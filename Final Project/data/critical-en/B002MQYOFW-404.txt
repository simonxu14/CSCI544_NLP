The last book of the saga exists as there should be an end where the good ones win over the bad ones (this is an american story after all). But the story drags on and the stamina of the plot and the writing  has been all used in the first two volumes. I forced myself to the end... just because I wanted to know how the good ones would win, not so much because I would have enjoyed the reading...
