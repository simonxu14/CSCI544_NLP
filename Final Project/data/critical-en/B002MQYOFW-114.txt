Just finished reading the last book in the Hunger Games series. I am giving this novel 3 stars for the following reasons...<br /><br />While the writing is excellent and each book is riveting, I can't help but feel disappointed that the author dedicated 1000+ pages (in 3 novels) to violence and the oppressive aura of the Panem world where the characters lived, but could not pull in one final chapter that gave the reader hope.  There was barely a glimpse of the better future that Katniss, Peeta, Haymich, Gale, Finnick and the others fought so long and hard to secure.  It was added in as an afterthought in an epilogue that was barely a page and a half long.<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen more balance between the violence that permeates all 3 novels and some periods of respite.  Those only came as the characters were unconscious or asleep.  It occurred to me that I find it somewhat disturbing that Ms Collins can write untold chapters describing the most gruesome tortures in graphic detail but not be able to find a few paragraphs within her writing soul that develop the bonds, friendships and relationships beyond the "arena" that were such a vital part of the story and the eventual outcome.<br /><br />For example ... Katniss' mother seemed to be totally forgotten by midway through book 3 and just faded into the background.  Katniss was left to fend for herself.  What mother would abandon her child - even a young adult child knowing how much pain she had been through?  Lastly, the relationship with Peeta was not explored at all after the rescue and with how the 2 had parted in the Capitol it was a bit far fetched that they would suddenly meet up again and everything would be rosy and fine which is what war alluded to in the Epilogue.<br /><br />As this novel was targeted to a late teen audience I think the violent content is a bit over the top and am having second thoughts about giving it to my 15 year old granddaughter to read.<br /><br />Pity really, because I greatly admire Ms Collins' ability to write so well in the first person, it is not an easy task.  I will see the movie, mainly because I am curious to see how the story is translated to the screen.
