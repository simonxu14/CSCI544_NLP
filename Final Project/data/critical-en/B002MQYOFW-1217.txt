I was warned that it was written for younger readers and I did find it simplistic in some areas, especially technology and descriptions of the various districts.<br /><br />Book one was the best for me, book two not so good and book three a little tedious at times.<br /><br />Well written and worth reading but limit your expectations.<br /><br />John Anderson
