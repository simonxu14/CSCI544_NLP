hunger games was the first book that I read of this kind.I liked the book and am not an author,but felt there could of been more details .I found myself skipping over some of the book.the plot of an overpopulated world children can provide for their families food,oil and for these provisions they have to put their name in a lottery to play in a game on t.v. where 2 kids from each district have to kill eachother off,last one standing.
