I loved the first two books in this series but was disappointed by the conclusion. Readers should be prepared for an unhappy ending before starting this book. Part of me wishes I had stopped at Catching Fire. The entire tone of the third book is very gloomy and Katniss isn't the strong character I loved from the first two. Worth reading but don't expect a big shiny happy ending.
