I liked all the books for the most part. It just felt like Suzanne Collins got angry and did the etchisketch end of the world ending for her books. Or that she turned into a three year old with a crayon that they just got ideas for the ending from her drawings. A little too heavy for the targeted audience I think...but that could just be me. Overall I liked the books.
