I'll try to write this without any spoilers! This trilogy was at its best in book one, where the hunting and survival aspects are central. As the trilogy proceeds into a political struggle with Katniss at its centre, it lost my interest. Further, Katniss' attitude got very tired very quickly and the only thing that kept me going was that it was a real page-turner, so I thought, what the heck, I've come this far. I think I'd aim this at the teenage audience because of the political concepts explored, but I don't know if the level of violence would be suitable for them. Meh!
