Wow.  I mean there was so much momentum from the first two books and there was &#34;Mockingjay&#34;.  I really disliked this book.  It seemed like it skipped the editing stage.  What happened?  Did Suzanne Collins get so popular from books one and two that she got to veto editing of this book?  It needs needs to be tightened up.  It needs some perspective of someone who's been in battle.  For me it really lack the heart-and-soul the material deserved at this point.  I just don't think the author had the chops to pull off the final act.
