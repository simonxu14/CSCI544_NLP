I'll save everyone some time...just read the first two books. The reason why I gave 2 stars instead of one, is because SC is still an awesome writer. The direction of the finale to this series however, will turn me away from her future novels. I loved how articulate and mind boggling the first two books were. The third book was just splattered paint on canvas, instead of delicately painted portraits.
