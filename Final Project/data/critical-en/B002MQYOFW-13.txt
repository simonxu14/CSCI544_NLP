*Spoilers*<br /><br />As so many others have said, the character development was seriously lacking. I finished this yesterday and I'm still wondering why Snow was so driven to be the bad guy. Was it power? Money? Hate against the districts? How is it this one character can constantly ruin people's lives for decades and the main characters never stop to ask, "why"? The fact that he's evil is obvious, but his motivations are not defined clearly. If I'm a target of so much hate, I'd certainly want to know why.<br /><br />Gale. Could his development get any worse as a main character?<br /><br />Prim. I didn't care when she died. That says everything right there. Katniss goes to the Hunger Games to save her sister but Prim isn't developed enough throughout 3 books that we even care that she dies?<br /><br />Finnick. He was the best of the support characters. His past and motivations were done very well. Then we're left with his death. That was a wasted opportunity.<br /><br />You get my point I'm sure. I didn't care that any of them died because the author never gave me a reason to care.<br /><br />Plot points. The attempt by Katniss to reach Snow is ridiculous. She finally makes a real decision for herself and that's it? Run through the capital, through all of the mine fields and such and somehow find a way to get close enough to the President to kill him? Yeah, good luck with that. What's even worse is that so many characters who should have known better and are more mature/experienced decision makers follow her willingly to their deaths.<br /><br />The relationship "choice" ended up being no choice at all. Katniss took what was left and there's no development.<br /><br />The whole ending leaves me empty, in fact. It's nothing to do with "war is bad" or ptsd or any of the messages. It's simply rushed. There's no real recovery of the people or country. The epilogue is nearly pointless in fact. Ok, they lived and had kids. Got it.<br /><br />I look back on the first two books and wonder if they weren't rated too highly. None of the characters from those books, with the exception of Rue, seems to matter at all as a person in the story. Others have plenty to offer, but I couldn't care a bit about them. Considering some of them were in all 3, how much does that say about the development throughout the trilogy?
