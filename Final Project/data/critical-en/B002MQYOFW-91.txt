Hunger Games Review<br /><br />-The pace never slackened. I'm a voracious reader, but I really only stick with things that hold my attention well. I'll skip forward in a true crime book, for example, if they're dragging on about something boring. That over 1,000 pages kept me so engaged is really amazing.<br />-I like that she parsed out the necessary details of the society when you needed them instead of laying everything out in the beginning.<br />-I love that she used numerals instead of spelling out number, for example District 2 instead of District Two. It made it MUCH easier to follow. I know this isn't necessarily proper "form" but it made it much easier to read.<br />-The love triangle was amazing. I'm writing this review as I'm almost done with the last book and I'm DYING to know if Katniss chooses Peeta or Gale!<br /><br />Having seen the first 3 movies, the first 2 books were very easy to comprehend in terms of the action. I'm reading Mockingjay before the 4th movie comes out. The first half of the book that corresponded to the Mockingjay Part 1 movie was easy to understand. However,<br />past the halfway point of the book, the action is definitely not as clear IMHO. I find myself re-reading paragraphs to get a grasp of what's going on, where everyone is, etc. I think it would've been helpful to use more descriptive metaphors.<br /><br />****SPOILERS AHEAD****<br /><br />So I just finished this, and I really can't help but feel enormously cheated by the ending. I just don't see why she had to kill off Prim, make Katniss assassinate Coin, and basically go mad and end up so broken. As a writer it seriously bothers me bc it breaks so completely with the themes that were being beautifully woven. Katniss was one of the coolest heroes ever, and I felt like she fell incredibly short of her potential at the end.
