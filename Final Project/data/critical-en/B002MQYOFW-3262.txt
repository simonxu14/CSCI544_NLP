If you have read anything about this book don't read the book. The Hunger Games is like the 90 minute comedy movie that shows all the funny parts in<br />the movie trailer. They spend 50 pages leading up to selecting the participants in the hunger games. Guess what the narrator ends up in the games<br />and spoiler alert guess who wins? The movie may be alot better than the book, let's hope. There weren't any real twists or much suspense just waiting<br />for the inevitable finish.
