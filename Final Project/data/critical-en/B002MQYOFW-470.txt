I was absolutely let down by the final book in the series. The first two had lots of interesting ideas and plot twists with the usual mix of teen angst. The third book was a sad attempt at conclusion which left me regretting having started the series. Not only did she do a poor job of tying up the plot, she completely dropped the romance angle with an unsupported ending. I enjoyed the mental games Katniss endured in the first two books but the third was a headache for me. Whenever Collins needed to advance the plot she simply had Katniss undergo and accident and wake up, miraculously healed, with a friend telling her what has happened while she was out. In the end, the "protagonist" does no real deeds to help the cause and is merely a pawn. She never  even stands up for herself by the end. Not only am I disappointed in the writing but I am saddened that the opportunity to have character growth was reduced to middle school drama fits and character confusion. Both editors and publishers for this book should be ashamed that this version was sent to print.
