Pre-ordered this book over 6-months ago and acidentally picked Super Saver shipping.  It was released on August 23rd and I still haven't received it.  When I picked Super Saer shipping, I didn't realize that meant it would be delivered by snails.  I'm sure it is going to be a great book, but next time i will just go and pick my items up at Wal-Mart.
