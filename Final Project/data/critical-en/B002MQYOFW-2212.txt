I should preface this review by saying that I read a lot, and am drawn to engaging, poetic prose with intellectual concepts that really get me thinking. I was not the target audience for this series. However, because of all the acclaim, I decided to read the first book.<br /><br />Possible spoilers, although only on minor plot points:<br /><br />I like a book where I can learn a new word or two, or struggle with an intriguing ethical dilemma, or connect with the characters' emotional complexities. This book had none of that. The plot of this story was highly implausible. The rule changes, the lack of emotion in the characters or their families, the fact that in a fight to the death, a character would actually let Katniss run away because he "owed her one" (referring to Flesh) was just unbelievable. Flesh had her on the ground. Are we really to believe that he would just let her go so easily, knowing eventually she'd become his predator?<br /><br />The love story between Peeta and Katniss, though undoubtedly essential to the story, bored me to tears. I couldn't have been the only adult reader wishing their little adolescent romance would progress, even to a simple steamy make-out session, on one of those cool nights when they lay huddled together in the cave.<br /><br />I felt like every opportunity the author had to show us different facets of Katniss' character was lost. Instead of killing people directly, Katniss barely killed in this story. And when she did, as stated, it was in an indirect manner. She was mainly on the defense and killed in order to survive, instead of preying on her competitors. I would have liked to see her befriend Rue and then come face-to-face with choosing between Rue's life or her own. No cop-outs: if she had killed Rue or even Peeta, I would have been sold. I would have been invested. I would have felt the anguish, the terror, the trauma of her experience. But instead, everything was all too easy: she was a skilled hunter and had the advantage of a fabricated love story with Peeta to win her the approval of her benefactors. Even the few other characters that we DO get to know are murdered off by other undeveloped characters we don't care about. Give me something to care about!<br /><br />I may sound crazy for saying this, but the novel just wasn't dark enough for me.
