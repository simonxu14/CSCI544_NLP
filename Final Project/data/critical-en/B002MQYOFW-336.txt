This was a good first book. I thought the book was well written. However, the story doesn't end here and I'd like to reserve total star reviews until I've finished the whole series. Â There were some underlying themes in the story I am not sure sit real well with me, and I would very much like to give the whole story a chance- not just rate one book in the series.<br /><br />That said, my young adolescent friend is reading this book, after having seen the movie, and thinks it is amazing. Great job by the movie makers for producing a film that made her want to read the book.
