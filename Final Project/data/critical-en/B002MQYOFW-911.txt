My first mistake was that I did not realize until later that the product was coming from the UK, since there is no paperback version of Mockingjay in the U.S. yet. I ordered it for a Christmas gift, however amazon predicted it would come much later than expected. I contacted seller about it, but they ensured it would get here on time. I should have known better, the book came a few days after Christmas. Also, the paperback version from the UK does not look like the blue hardcover cover in the description at all, it is actually orange.<br /><br />Aside from the set backs, the product came in great shape! I just wish it would have arrived on time.
