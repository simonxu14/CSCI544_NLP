I loved the first hunger games and instantly bought the next two. But after reading them i found that they got a little depressing because people who mean something such as finnick and gale either die or betrayal and it is sad.<br />What is wih the rather depressing ending???? Dont read this if u dont want to read about people having depressing amd gruesome deaths.
