This book, written for young adults, captured my imagination with its somewhat prophetic view of one possible future. The writing style and use of the present tense moved the story along uniquely and kept the action fresh. The opening chapter describing Katniss' at home hooked me right away. The first book was my favorite, but I am glad the author took the time to develop more fully this tenuous future. I am not sure I liked how the story ended, but on further reflection, I am impressed with the author not glamorizing war in the end, and allowing the reader to see the ugly results of war. I actually think the message of this book is a subversive message against war and violence and ends up asking a hopeful question in the end---&#34;will we get it right this time?&#34; I am glad I read this book but found it strangely unsatisfying. Probably a good sign that it carries a counter cultural message. A good read even if you have seen the movies. The book gives more depth to Katniss.
