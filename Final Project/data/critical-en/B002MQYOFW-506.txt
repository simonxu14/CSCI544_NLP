i am reading the series again and i don't know if i want read it again. i think this book is the most depressing even though the whole series is about 24 teens killing each other for entertainment.<br />SPOILER START<br /> The fact that peeta gets so hurt that he thinks Katniss is a Mutt just makes me sick.y  would anyone do that to him? SPOILER END<br />anyone who likes a sad love/thriller novel, this book would be good for you. but let me tell you, i cried the first half of this book. although i didn't like the book, i am looking forward to the movie ( not that it will be any better. ;) )
