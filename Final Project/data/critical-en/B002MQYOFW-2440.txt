I've never written a review on Amazon, but here goes.<br /><br />How do I UN-READ this book??  I WAS the biggest fan of the first two. I saw the film trailer, then bought the audio version of Hunger Games to listen to on a ten hour trip.  I was hooked.  I ordered the second book, and read it in three days.  I've told everyone I know about the series, and was looking forward to giving them a second read; and of course watching the film.<br /><br />Then I read this "mutt" of a book.  Wow!  The author completely killed any desire I had to re-live the journey with these characters.<br /><br />Hopefully Lions Gate will write a new story for the Mockingjay film (if it ever gets this far), and give us a film that doesn't make us want to un-see the first two.  At this point, I'm not sure I'll be seeing Hunger Games anymore.<br /><br />If the author's smart, she'll give us a fourth book in which Katniss wakes up, and all the events in Mockingjay were a bad dream.
