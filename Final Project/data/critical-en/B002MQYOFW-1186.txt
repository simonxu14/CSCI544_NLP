The Hunger Games is a book with a plot that reminded me about a Schwarzenegger's film The Running Man. Later I heard about the film so I decided to buy the book. It is very entertaining, but do not expect the book of your life. Also for me, that I like to read in English to improve my level, is a book easy to read. I also recommend to see the film after reading the book, they are complementarys. Now I am reading the last book of the trilogy, so I can say it is addicitve, you want to know what is going to happen.
