I read the first book and thought it was great.  Sad but great.  Then got to the second and was beginning to see the downward spiral of death and destruction.  By the third I could barley finish.  I was flabbergasted by all the horrific scenes.  I felt so depressed every time I closed the book. The ending was also quite boring.<br />I would recommend the first but not the last unless you like to read about children and women dying.  Sorry for the spoilers but I think a person should know what they are about to get into in a book.
