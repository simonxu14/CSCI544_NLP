I read the first Hunger Games book out of curiosity when I heard that the movie was coming out. Yes, I was a prisoner of the moment... sue me. Anyway, I found the first book to be absolutely incredible. I devoured it - page after page without stopping. I think I finished it in just a couple of days. Naturally, I was excited to read the other two books in the trilogy. Let me just begin by saying that the second book is easily the weakest in the trilogy. I don't want to be unfair, but the development of Katniss as a character kind of made me lose respect for her from the first novel to the second. She goes from hardcore tom-boy with an attitude problem in the first book, to being a whiney, blubbering, emotional teenage trainwreck in book two. Mockingjay redeems her a little bit, as she is forced to lay the smackdown on some fools and finally becomes the hero we've been waiting for. But it takes her a long and somewhat boring book (Catching Fire) to get her there. I bought this combined trilogy for the convenience of having all three books on my Kindle. If you haven't read them, go ahead and do it. There is enough good material between the first and third book to make up for the slow pace of the second book. You will have quite a few page-turning moments, and a ton of chapter endings that absolutely force you to turn to the first page of the next chapter just to see what happens. However, I will admit that the second book (and parts of the third) make this trilogy good... but not great.
