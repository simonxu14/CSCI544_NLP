I've read through all three books of this series. And I feel, flat out, like I wasted my time & my money. I kept hoping they would get better, but my fears were realized when I finished the final book. Not worth the read. No great message, or beautiful truths for slogging through this mess of just - blah! One of the biggest problems I had with these books, right from the start, is that they are too, too violent. No, they don't have blatant sex, but they more than make up for that with their innuendoes and weird 'revelations' in the end book. Not interesting. Predictable. They talk a lot about the casualness of nudity. And the last book is so over the top violent that I became bored with it. And these books are touted as 'young adult' books? If I had read them as a young adult I would have been totally feeling hopeless by the end of them. No redeeming qualities. No hope in these books. By the end of the book, the Author pretty much destroys all the half decent reasons/ characters for reading the book. She's trying so hard to shock and surprise that she fails at both. The author makes a claim in the end book about how the Romans used the entertainment of graphic violence & food to keep it's citizens from active community involvement; but that's exactly what this book does. She condemns herself and methods in these books. I read these books because the first one was given to my thirteen year old son as a present, and I like to keep up on what he's reading. He wasn't interested in the book, and after reading the first I didn't encourage him, I am glad to say. Come on Authors out there; give us something that has real writing, that is worth reading, that stays with you, that makes you want to read it again and again. This felt like a soap opera, a bloody, senseless soap opera.
