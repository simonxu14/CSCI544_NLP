I ordered this several months ago and had it sent to my daughter who lives six hours from me.  Her children were reading and listing to the series, and the talents of Jim Dahl as narrator are superb.  I have all the books on audio, but the first four are on cassette and I thought it a good time to upgrade to CD since cassette players have become obsolete.  I ordered this on CD and it arrived as cassette tapes - she had no way to play them for her family and ended up buying an adaptor for her car because they were ready to listen to that book.  I received permission to return, but since I didn't have them in my possession until last month, and very busy schedules for both of us, the time to return them expired.  She gave the tapes recently to me but I have no way to use them now, disappointing.
