This book was terrible. It was so dull and boring I found myself skimming parts of the book. I mean seriously, how can there be a war going on and the main character is NOT involved in the war?<br /><br />There was just no redeeming quality in this book to bump it up to 2 stars. None of the characters were interesting. Katniss who I started to dislike in "Catching Fire" I hated by the end of this book. Self centered, whiny, just spewing anger, what an interesting character. Peeta who was never my favorite character was at least a happy character, but not in this book. Psychotic schizophrenic to put it bluntly. Gale just seemed to be around to antagonize Katniss, and then Haymitch and Finnick, my 2 favorite characters were barely in it. Katniss and Peeta's characters changed so much since "The Hunger Games", and that's too bad because Katniss, though a little dull, was at least heroic, not indifferent like in "Mockinjay".<br /><br />That leads me to Finnick's death....really? Such a great character, who was even married in the book and you kill him like that? Just an "Oh well, he's dead." Even Prim's death was lackluster since she was barely in the book.<br /><br />I found the writing very lazy too. Descriptions in this book weren't up to par with the first 2 books. Many things were never told to conclusion either. The end of the war.....how did that happen? Don't know because Katniss passed out. How did Peeta stabilize into a normal person that Katniss could end up with? Who knows, not important enough to include, I guess. What exactly went on with the trial? Not important enough either. How did Gale end up captured to being in a different district at the end? Glossed over in basically 2 sentences, and that's it. A cog in the all important love triangle was given a lazy ride off into the sunset. It's like Collins didn't know how to resolve each of these issues so didn't even bother trying.<br /><br />And really, what was up with the war? An EMP was used in the book by the Capitol I believe, so why didn't the Rebels or the Capitol drop an EMP on each other? Because the war would have been over too soon I guess.<br /><br />I may have been able to give it 2 stars if Katniss had been killed, but we knew that wouldn't happen. We have to save the undecisive, whiny hero to appease the fans. Let's kill off Finnick in a quick unglorified death instead.<br /><br />At least Haymitch survived to lead the exact same life as before Katniss was even in the Hunger Games. Yayyy for the rebellion, back at square one.
