Whatever happened to happy endings?  As the books progress the characters get more and more depressing and the story line is so filled with sadness and hardship.  Do not read this to feel good, read to finish the trilogy.  Would never have read this book by itself and did read it only out of curiosity (I wanted to finish the story).  Ug, almost makes me sorry I began reading the first book!!
