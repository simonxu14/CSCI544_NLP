Obviously, the book is great. I bought this to replace the seventh book of the series. Somehow along the way, I lost my copy of Deathly Hallows. I specifically chose this book from this buyer because the cover matched all of the other books I have at home. However, when the book arrived, it came without a cover! Which defeated my purpose of buying this particular book from this buyer, instead of just buying any copy of the book. Very disappointing.
