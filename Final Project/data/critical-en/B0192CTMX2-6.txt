I was one of the many who could not wait to get my hands on the latest Harry Potter book. I have been a definite fan since the very first chapter of the very first book, but it was with a great deal of disappointment that I finished the series.<br /><br />Rowling doesn't even appear to be trying anymore. The storyline wanders all over the place, there are great tracts of inactivity with too much over-dramatization of teen angst, the so-called 'drama' amounts to nothing more intricate than a mass kill-fest wherein she slashes down characters in a freshman-creative-writing-class manner with very little attention paid to the aftermath of such deaths. The ending is sloppy and deeply unsatisfying, the 'explanations' for many of the interesting mysteries set up in the previous books are pathetic and poorly thought out, and the final chapter was so bad as to make me actually cringe. The Epilogue, as it is laughingly called, is little more than a badly written list of the children that Harry and Ginny, Ron and Hermione, and other obvious pairs have. I have read better endings than this tripe in fanfiction works by fifteen year olds.<br /><br />Among the questions that the patient reader never has answered are these: Does Harry ever become an Auror? What jobs do Hermione and Ron have? How does George deal with the death of his twin? Does Harry ever see the Dursleys again? How does Hogwarts fare after that massive battle at the end of the book? ... The list is literally miles long.<br /><br />Rowling dropped the crystal ball so hard that it shattered, sucking away a great deal of the joy that I found in the series as a whole. It is with a heavy heart that I am forced, by a sense of literary taste, to call Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows one of the most disappointing and enraging pieces of trash to ever sail out of an overpaid author's hands. Rowling has clearly lost all respect for her readers, and this book shows it.
