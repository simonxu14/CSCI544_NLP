I'm disappointed!  I'm a 50 year old woman and I thought books one and two were wonderful!  I couldn't put them down, in fact I stayed up most of the night to read them when they were released.  From that point on things became dark, then darker.  Book 4 was weird and depressing.  Book 5 and 6 were OK but not something I thought my preteen grandchildren should read.  Then book 7 . . . all the hype and the build up and instead of having a hard time putting it down, I had a hard time sitting there reading it.  For most of the book, it was boring.  The last 200 pages were good, and they held my interest.  I liked the way the book ended and felt a sense of closure to the series.  Overall however in review, the whole series doesn't live up to the quality of the first two books. As some reviewers have stated I believe Rowling must have had ghost writers after the first two books.  Some people will forever be fans, but I leave with a sense of disappointment that this will not be a series I can sit and read to my grandchildren.  If they read it (or see the movies) they will need to be much older since it now is on the edge of a nicely ending horror story.
