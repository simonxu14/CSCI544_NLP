Oh Suzanne...why did you do it? You could have nicely wrapped up the series. Followed the path everyone wanted but you didn't. The last 25% percent of the book it a very disappointing end to the series. This little story is the best way I can describe what happened in this last book. The family is out for a drive. We all know where the drive ends but just before we get there Mom says let's get off the nicely paved roads and see the back roads. The roads are rough and the car bounces all over the place. You see some things you wouldn't have if you stayed on the nice paved road but really you could careless. Also on your little detour you end up loosing some items out of the car. No reason for it to happen it just does. Eventually the drive ends at your destination but you are a little ticked off at Mom because she just had to take the unnecessary detour.<br />I gave Hunger Games five stars. Catching Fire four stars. I'm being generous in giving Mockingjay three. When it really comes down to it 10% of Mockingjay is five stars. 65% is four stars and 25% is one star. It really bugs me when authors make a conscience effort not to do what everyone thinks they should even though they have for 80% of the story. Just give us what we want. Suzanne why did you have to mess it up.
