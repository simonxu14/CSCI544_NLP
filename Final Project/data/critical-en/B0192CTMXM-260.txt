This felt like a completely different book from all the rest.<br /><br />They spent most of the book out in the woods camping and making no progress which felt like filler to me.<br />The Deathly Hallows seemed like something JK tacked on as an after thought.<br />They spent a bunch of time looking for the Deathly Hallows and in the end they were not important at all.<br />There was no development in any of the relationships either Harry/Ginny or Ron/Granger unless you count that 10 years later BS JK added.<br />And the final Battle was a pretty big let down with that whole your evil can't hurt us anymore BS.<br /><br />All her previous books were building up to this and it sucked.  I was very disappointed.
