I compared the Kindle version with the hard copy book.  The most noticeable difference is that the bullseye and arrow illustration that marks the beginning of each chapter is not in the Kindle version.  It does not deter from the story, but I wish the Kindle version looks the same as the hard copy. In both versions, I found 3 or 4 grammatical errors, which was annoying. Also, I don't think this book is appropriate for anyone younger than middle school age due to many violent and kissy-kissing scenes. High-schoolers and above will enjoy this thrilling book. I can't wait for the Catching Fire Kindle version!
