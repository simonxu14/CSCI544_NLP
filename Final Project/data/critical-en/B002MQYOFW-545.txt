The main characters were interesting, and the background was intriguing, but I felt the storyline was fairly predictable.  There we're a few situations that held my interest to the point that I wanted to keep reading, but for the most part I didn't have a problem putting the book down.  It was not a book that held my interest to the point that I didn't want to stop reading....Not a bad read, just not as compelling as I had hoped it would be.<br />I think it would be good read for a younger person, someone that is just beginning to have an interest in exploring the world of literature.
