It almost had me at hello... but then it said good-bye.  And tried to say hello again, before saying good-bye and coming back for a final hello.  There were a few times where I thought it should have ended before it finally did.  To each their own - I know a lot of people who thought this was the best one yet, I thought it was the least well done and tried to please too many.
