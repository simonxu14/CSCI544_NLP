I would like to start this review stating that the first two books were not reviewed and to be fair with my rating I would like to mention that both past books in my opinion get 5 stars. The story is really good, yes it uses scenarios or instances used in other books or stories but the part that got me to like them were the characters, the ease of read, and the story itself.<br /><br />The third book on the other hand I feel it should have been shorter, it easily has half the book of "fill up" material, it made me feel like I wanted to skip a couple of chapters all together but I kept on reading. The characters and how the story unveils is why this book is a must read if you need closure to the epic story.<br /><br />It is not comparable to the past books I felt this one was dull at some points, I wont mention how I think it should be or what I didn't like in terms of spoilers, but I felt this book lacked the same intensity and writing quality as the past two books.
