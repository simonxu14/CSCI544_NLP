I won't go over the plot of the book as that has been well covered here. However, I must say that I absolutely loved, adored, and obsessed over the first two books. They were incredible.  The third book...not so much. In fact, I wondered if Suzanne Collins really even wrote it at times because it seemed to be completely out of character for her compared to the first two. Like another reader, I didn't read the book for a week or so after I got it because I didn't want the story to end, and I was so disappointed when I finally did read it. It's a good book though, just not in comparison to the other two.
