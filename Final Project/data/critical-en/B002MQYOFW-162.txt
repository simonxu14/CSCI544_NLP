I finished the first two books very quickly and it took me forever to get through this last one... the storyline got flat, the main character "Katniss" began to annoy me and the other characters that I really liked were either killed off or their inclusion in the story was very limited in comparison to the first two books.<br /><br />I feel as if the author rushed to finish the trilogy and not as much care and thought was put into it. Very disappointing...
