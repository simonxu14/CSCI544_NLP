After reading the first 2 installments of the Trilogy I had to complete it...I was actually a bit bored by the time I got to this book but it did offer some epic battles and capped off the story.  Whether or not I liked the ending is up for debate, I guess it had to conclude somehow...but I'll let you decide for yourself.
