What was that, Suzanne Collins???<br /><br />Was this book written by the same author that penned the first 2 installments of 'The Hunger Games'?  Her name is on the cover.....I guess she must have been "hijacked"  I agree with the many comments on the lack of character develpoment.  It also seems that some of the storylines from the previous 2 books were just forgotten about in favor of some sort of demented anti-war message.  The book felt rushed and lacked in emotion and detail.  An extreme disappointment and failure.
