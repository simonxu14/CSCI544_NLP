I loved the first book. LOVED IT. I really enjoyed the second, and was excited for the third (for the record, this series was recommended to me and I read all three books in about 4 days). And like many reviewers, when I finished Mockingjay I wasn't sure how I felt about it. I was disappointed in Katniss' character, in the ending, in the many chapters that ended in blackouts.<br /><br />But what really bothered me was the things that were casually tossed around without much detail. The districts have united (we hear that 2 are in rebel control, then suddenly all but District 2 are against the capitol). Gale goes to 2 and their friendship is over (how do two people who are that connected just split without saying anything to each other? Although the character of Gale wasn't really fleshed out, it isn't in what we know of his character to just leave Katniss, even if she can't love him the way he wants her to, without more than two sentences spoken between them). Katniss shoots Coin (but with little to no reasoning). Katniss votes for the Hunger Games (again, we are in her mind throughout the series, and yet she doesn't think about this much at all and we're given little reasoning for it.) Peeta and Katniss 'grow back together'. (After all those 2 had been through, I wanted to SEE this, to HEAR them talk to see more of the small moments).<br /><br />However, the first and second books WERE really good...so I'm left at a loss as to how to feel about this book. In fact, this book needed to be two books. A third book needed to focus on Katniss recovering from the second trip to the arena, district 13, becoming a soldier and working to unite the districts. She needed to make a choice instead of the running/hiding bit (which is understandable at first with what she's been through). She needed to play an active role in rescuing Peeta. All these things, with the proper pacing and action, with much more detail would have made a good book. In fact, a good place to end would have been with her blacking out after being attacked by Peeta.<br /><br />A fourth book should have covered Peeta's recovery and Katniss' reaction to him, the attack on the Capitol, the aftermath (which we should have gotten to know more about instead of just the drug/prison bit) and her future. Again, with much more detail.<br /><br />That is what is wrong with this book...it feels like a skimmed account, a summary of events instead of a conclusion of a good series. It could have been so much more. I wanted so much more! I feel a bit cheated...but the series IS worth reading!
