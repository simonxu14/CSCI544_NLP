The ONLY reason I am giving this book 2 stars instead of one is that it did not leave you hanging at the end. You did get a conclusion to the story.<br /><br />Everything else about the book was awful. Some say she retained her fast pace writing, I say she glossed over numerous points that should have been expanded on and the book was constantly introducing you to new characters without giving any real insight into who they actually were. There's only a small description of a major player in the book and though Collins tries to get an emotional connection set up with some of the more secondary characters, when they die I honestly don't care.<br /><br />The book was written very poorly, it seems like it was done in a rush. I was hoping for a real heroine with Katniss, but instead I continued to get the same pushover that was in the 2 other books who couldn't make any real decisions on her own. Everything was decided for her and she just continued to play along.<br /><br />The first book was great, the second book was good, the third book was just plain awful.
