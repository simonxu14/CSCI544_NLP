As far as content goes, my 7 year old couldn't be happier. In fact, he's read it cover to cover probably 15 times. The information is great and everything a Pokemon fan would hope for. The binding is another story. After just a week, pages began to fall out. It's now pretty much unsalvageable. While one can expect some normal wear and tear, especially with a Pokemon book owned by a 2nd grader, this is beyond that. If your kids are going to actually want to LOOK at this book for any amount of time, it's probably best to buy a few copies.
