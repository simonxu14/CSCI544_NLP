There was an addiction to this series that few books can spark.  After tearing through the first 2 books time and time again, I was ready for the final book to keep me hooked with that same intensity, character, and readability.  While the first two books could mix the weight of despair with the thrill of finding out what happens next, I found myself slogging through Mockingjay and not enjoying it even a tiny bit.  There was a rush in the previous books' bleakness, but the final book made me apathetic about characters that had meant a lot to me before I started this book.  After spending this long journey with them, I went from liking the characters to just waiting for them to hurry up and die.<br /><br />  With this final book, the characters act so strangely that I can't even stay interested.  Why is this happening to Peeta?  Why is that character showing up?  Why are the wrong characters dying? I understand war is horrible and unpredictable, but the final showdown doesn't feel believable and after 2 books of feeling bad for the characters, I was ready for them to have some joy.  Instead, I'm given awkward pacing, character detachment, and a predictable ending.  The Mockingjay finally made me stop and wonder why I'm so absorbed in a series that is all about having children fight to the death.<br /><br />  There are a small handful of decent ideas in it, but not enough to save the book.  I don't know if there is a perfect way to end this trilogy, but I do know that this tragic story can't compete with its predecessors and in many ways has jumped the shark.  I'd like to see "mulligan" called and see the last book written again.  The author has so much talent but I just didn't feel it here.
