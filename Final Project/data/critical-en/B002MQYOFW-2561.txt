In the aftermath of the movie director not signing up for the sequels inspite of the overwhelming success of the movie, people wonder why.<br /><br />After reading the second and third book, I realized why. The source material is such a foul well to draw on for the movies. Gary Ross was wise not to tackle such garbage.<br /><br />Book 3, Yuckingjay, is such a waste of time. Don't even bother driving to the public library to borrow this, much so spend money on it.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins should have just sold her soul to the devil like JK Rowling.
