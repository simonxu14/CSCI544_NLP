I may have read this book a bit differently than some fans of the series in the sense that I devoured all three books in a row after having had them recommended by a friend. Therefore, it's a bit harder for me to separate out all of the books from one another, but this book seemed to me to be the weakest of the three. The greatest thing about the prior books, in my opinion, was that the characters stayed true to themselves. That didn't seem to be the case in the third.<br /><br />In the case of Peeta, his breaking from character was out of his control due to the storyline. But Gale and Katniss? And Katniss' mother? All seemed to go completely haywire. In the prior two books I never got the sense that Gale was so mindlessly bloodthirsty. And Katniss seemed to have spent the book in a daze, making a decision and then completely overturning it on the next page. The ending did not do her justice, and her selection of her mate was a total cop-out. It's a shame the series is ending on this note.<br /><br />I gave the book 3 stars because despite my criticisms, I still was riveted to the story. Reading this book is not time wasted; the story just could've used a bit more care and nurturing.
