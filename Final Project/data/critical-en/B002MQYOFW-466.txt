well written compelling reading as an adventure story - but you have to stomach the context of a world in which abuse of teenagers is the norm and happens throughout the book series - teen heroine glimpses that this is wrong  but at end there is no compelling reason to believe the system for the future will be better.  Running the world like a video game or reality show is shown up as vacuous and ugly but this book is overhyped as having a major message.
