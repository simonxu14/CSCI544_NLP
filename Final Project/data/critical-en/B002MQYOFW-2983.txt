I got this book so I could see what the fuss was about, but I haven't managed to get past chapter 6 (in retrospect I wonder how I managed to get that far). The writing style is just terrible: short sentences with no sense of flow between them. Sometimes I had difficulty comprehending what the author was trying to say due to the style.<br /><br />I can't really comment on the other aspects of the book, due to the fact that I haven't read past chapter 6, but honestly if you have any standards when it comes to writing I would avoid this book. I will have to try the movie some time.
