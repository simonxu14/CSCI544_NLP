Greatly disappointed.  Often times when you wait for the next book in a series to come out, the anticipation raises the expectation.  I was afraid that was going to happen with Mockingjay since I thoroughly enjoyed Hunger Games and found Catching Fire absolutely riveting.  This novel was a chore to finish.  It had some catch-your-breath moments, but they were too few and surrounded by redundant, depressing minutia.  I had predicting a variety of possible endings, but none as boring or as anti-climatic as the actual novel.  Do yourself a favor:  If you liked the first two novels, do not taint them by reading this book.  Your imagination will far surpass the author's.
