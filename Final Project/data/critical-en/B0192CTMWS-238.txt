while some parts of the book were beautifully well-written and evoked alot of emotion, most of the book was one big disappointment.<br /><br />characters:<br /><br />First let's talk about Harry, because he was my favorite character; was. We saw him evolve from book one:  he was nothing special, just a boy wizard going to school and had one amazing talent - flying(he's the youngest seeker). In the second book we find that he has another talent crucial to finding the slytharin monster (something even the likes of Dumbledore couldn't do because all the great wizards of hogwarts' history couldn't "speak it.") In the third book, Harry is finally growing up and actually LEARNING magic, and getting really good at it. he was best in the year (even better than Hermione!!) at DADA and was able to cast a patronus better than anyone (even against a hundred dementers!) In book four he was getting even better! he could throw off an imperious curse (the only one who could do it!) he was able to tackle the WORST dragon with the most points, he was there FIRST by the mermaids, and was able to tackle blast ended skrewts. we were getting excited about this boy wizard, he was becoming a stronger hero every year!! in the fifth book we saw that he was able to lead as well. we forgave him for not being able to master occlumency, after all Snape was never able to teach him anything, he hated him too much. but we do see a boy who is mature enough to feel horrified at his dad's behaviour towards his enemy.<br /><br />Suddenly this boy becomes as stupid as Dudley counting his birthday presents. no more is he a stong wizard or any good at DADA. the only time he did anything significant was when his wand just "found" voldemort and broke Lucius's wand. all other encounters with DEs & voldemort he was stupid and helpless, and if Hermione wasn't there he'd be dead. (remember, she was supposed to be the genius that comes up with ideas and knows all the facts, NOT the one to actually be able to escape tight situations: that was Harry's job.)<br /><br />So Harry is not a competent wizard, OK I would have accepted that, since in book six he is suddenly not as competent. fine, but he IS a good boy, we are told. (WE ARE TOLD!) He is pure of heart, good, and brave. Oh, and he has love; such strong love that he wouldn't think twice to lay down his life for his friends, right? unfortunately, NO WHERE in the whole book is he behaving like a good pure boy. it's Hermione who thinks of saving Xeno and Luna, Harry doesn't seem to care! He has no problem consenting to the dumbest idea EVER the "seven Potters", and he knows that this can cause Voldemort to be after his best friends! Furthermore, he tortures a DE and this cannot be forgiven (an UNFORGIVABLE curse). good? pure? full of love? I don't see it.<br /><br />Even at the end when he walks to his death, he DOES NOT do it to save anyone's life, he does not do it out of love for anyone, he does it simply because DD tells him to. it's part of his job. it will help finish yet another horcrux. THis was not heroic, this was pathetic. (and it was out of character. sounds more like something Snape would have done) If Harry wanted R&H (& Neville) to finish off the rest of the horcruxes and voldemort, he should have walked to his death before Fred, Lupin, Colin, Tonks and 50 other people died. He didn't, which means he did not care about their deaths, only about finishing Voldemort. how ruthless!<br /><br />now let's talk about Voldemort. he is the whole story, after all. The evil, terrifying, undefeatable, dark wizard. I couldn't see why anyone would be terrified of him at all. and as he hardly killed anyone in the whole book (except for his own DEs), I can't see why he is evil. He should have killed every one of the "Seven Potters" just like he killed the "spare" Cedric. What, he's suddenly afraid to kill? I thought that if Voldemort wanted to kill someone, there was no way out. He was SO powerful and SO evil! oh well, a dark lord.<br /><br />Snape:<br /><br />He was probably the most exciting character in the whole saga. He's good, yet he's so bad. He's SO MEAN, but he works against Voldemort. He HATES Harry, yet he protects him. every book got us more excited about Snape. That's why he was the most dissappointing. In the epilogue, Harry says that Snape was the bravest man he'd ever known. However, NO WHERE in the book does Snape do anything remotely brave.  and his death is the most meaningless of all. (I know what she was trying to teach here: Voldemort treats even his best DEs like disposable objects. See? He even killed his most trusted DE just to get a wand. Or she might try to teach that killing Dumbledore, even though it was planned was a bad thing and Snape should be punished for that) But why waste such a good character for these minilessons? He was so much more important than that.<br /><br /> "Look at me" was supposed to be touching, but when you think about it, it was meaningless. Snape died thinking Harry was dying too. Snape did nothing to save Lily's son from this final fate of doom, so why the "look at me"?<br /><br />Humor:<br /><br />we loved the first 5 books because they were full of fun dialogs and hilarious situations. (like Snape telling Harry that his head is not allowed in hogsmead, no part of his body has permission to be in hogsmead) where are those funny moments now?? I understand these books are dark, but we can still have fun with some characters like Gred and Feorge I heavily relied on them for some fun during Harry's stay at the burrow.<br /><br />The deaths:<br /><br />while it's understandable that some characters we loved will have to die at the end of the books, it was a bit too cruel to kill off one weasly twin. Fred and George were the only people who were able to bring in some light-hearted fun even during the most depressing situations. They were two-dimensional characters. They were placed in the story only for comic relief. You don't kill off a two-dimensional character, I'm sorry. But if you HAVE to kill off the funniest characters, at least make the death MEANINGFUL in some way! Meaningful to the plot as well as to the hero. (oh, but wait, our hero is not the good, pure, loving boy we thought he was anyway)<br /><br />Lupin, Tonks, and poor Colin Creevy's deaths were even less meaningful to the plot or to anyone. Yes, I know, I know, she was trying to teach us that death is sudden and, during war, can become meaningless, but a story should be entertaining, not preaching.<br /><br /> And I really didn't like how Harry's parents were encouraging him to go to his death. It goes against everything that this story was supposed to be about.
