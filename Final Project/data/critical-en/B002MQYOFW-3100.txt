I could not wait to begin reading the 3rd book in the series, The Mockingjay, so I immediately ordered it from Amazon.  I placed the order on Nov.3 and today is Dec. 5 and I still HAVE NOT RECEIVED my book!!!  I have contacted both the seller (twice) and Amazon, and here I sit without a refund or my book.  I am just wondering what happened in the series...Hmmm...maybe someday I'll get to read the book.<br />VERY UNHAPPY!!!
