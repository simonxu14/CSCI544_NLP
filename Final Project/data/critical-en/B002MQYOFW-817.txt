Very dissapointing ending. Our main character is absolutely insignificant for most of the book. When she tries to be great, her actions ends up not mattering at all except leaving to dead allies. And when she has the chance to do great things, she just does nothing. She's suicidal, depressive and absolutely not inspiring or interesting at all. Not at all the strong person we knew from the first two books.<br /><br />The love plot has also been left to play a very insignificant part compared to the first few books, which seems very weird, since it has played so big a part in the first two books. It's absolutely anticlimatic how little this seems to interest the author in this final book. I was very dissapointed.<br /><br />The author also seems to have a perverse love for describing the killing of kids in this book to a degree and detail level that left me nauseus several times. Bad things happen to good people - okay, I get it. But here it was just taken way further than needed.<br /><br />The ending also left me feeling really empty. There's a plot twist (that I sort of saw coming) which left me excited about Katniss reaction and saw the possibility for a great and exciting ending after all. And then the author just ruined it in a very confusing and completely random way, fast-forward'ed some years and there - done. Absolutely horrible and unsatisfying ending, leaving to many obvious plots unfinished.'<br /><br />Is this really the same author as the first two books?! All in all, a disappointing, unsatisfying, slightly boring and nauseating final book in the series.
