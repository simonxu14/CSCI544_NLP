There was so much possibility going into the end of this series, but I felt completely let down and disappointed with this conclusion. &#34;Mockingjay&#34; felt rushed and thrown together compared to the first two books in the series. Some of the details and events Ms. Collins came up with were very creative, but others were just bizarre. I liked the series, and I would recommend it to others, but not without some heavy caveats regarding &#34;Mockingjay&#34;.
