I was underwhelmed with this entire series. I dispute the basic premise - that a dictator can hold power by shocking the underlings with the unexpected. I think that not knowing who or what to expect is the fastest way to bring on revolution.....that said, I read this book about a month ago and am having a hard time remembering the plot, except that it was one more round of pitting young people against one another......Although well written this was far from my favorite trilogy (yes, I admit to having read all three volumes but I'm not sure why I bothered).
