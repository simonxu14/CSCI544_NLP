A 7 book series is quite an achievement and Rowling obviously took care and thought with the story's conclusion. HOWEVER, sadly, the developments (both plot and, with only one exception, character) were disappointments for me.<br /><br />Harry's world is dark now, with relentless killings of young and old, characters we care about and those we only briefly knew. How will this be translated to the screen and still be suitable for children? I'm an adult, but I was attracted through the years to the inventive fantasy that she created, and the imaginative mix of characters, good and bad, always swirling around the young hero and his friends.<br /><br />The conflict with Voldemort was never the heart of the series to me. Unfortunately, continuing a trend that began in books 5 and 6, in book 7, the conflict with Voldemort is not only the centerpiece, but becomes increasingly suffocating--to the detriment of good story-telling, in my opinion.<br /><br />Too. Much. Death.  Too. Many. Losses (in dying but also in character development. Several girls, in particular, seem suddenly diminished and cliched). By focussing so much on the destruction of Voldemort, Rowling also has destroyed much that was enjoyable in her series to begin with.<br /><br />And? Worst of all? If the ending can be believed, it appears that in a world without Voldemort, wizards simply become...muggles.
