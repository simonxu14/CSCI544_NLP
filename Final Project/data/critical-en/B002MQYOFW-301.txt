I found this book as addictive as the past two yet towards the end there is a sense that the author rushed the ending, left too many loopholes, lacked the depth of character as the other two books and seemed incongruent with their personalities. More detailing of events towards the end would of been appreciated instead of what felt like a grey quick run through of events instead of the vivid imagery that Collins has been able to offer in her past books.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone yet have them lower their expectation. Trilogies rarely have an Ending that ties everything together.
