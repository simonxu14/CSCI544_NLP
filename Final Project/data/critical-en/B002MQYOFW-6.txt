After thoroughly enjoying the first and second books in the Hunger Games series I eagerly picked up a copy of the Mockingjay. To rate the climax to the series as disappointing is a vast understatement. Amongst the abysmal dialogue there are unexplained major plot twists that are so horrendous and so poorly supported that even the most patient reader will find themselves rolling their eyes. In addition there is a myriad of convenient random aspects to let the heroin of the hook in virtually every situation. Virtually every aspect to the story that have made it interesting up to this point are thoroughly unraveled into a non-climatic boring ending. Where even the most simple questions of, "what happened to..." (name a major character) goes unanswered or worst yet unexplained. E.g. (major character) ended up in this district with a job. End of story.<br /><br />Ugh! This book was so frustratingly boring and so unbelievably bad that after reading it, I am removing all the recommendations I made for the first two books. IT IS SO BAD! It was so bad that I am struggling to characterize all the aspects that I found horrible. I strongly recommend that Suzanne Collins take this one back for a rewrite!
