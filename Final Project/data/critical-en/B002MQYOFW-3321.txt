I returned the kindle version for refund after several chapters when I realized it would not be getting any better. Not only is the plot deplorable but the writing is amateurish. As others have expressed, I'm disturbed that this has so much hype and appeal to young readers. Grammatically it sounds like it was written by a teenager, with lots of incomplete sentences and other flaws. Unfortunately our youth seem to be losing respect for the English language and for literary excellence.
