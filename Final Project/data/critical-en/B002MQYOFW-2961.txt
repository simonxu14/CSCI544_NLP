I enjoy the revival of the modern Young Adult fiction genre. However, this novel does not belong in that genre. It needs to be labeled as a High School fiction, or something like that. Sentences were too short, vocab was limited; it was written at maybe a 9th grade level. Very hard to read as an adult. I think watching an episode of Sponge Bob would be more satisfying as an adult.<br />However, if I were still in HS or MS, I am sure I would love this novel and series.
