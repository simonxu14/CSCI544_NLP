There are plenty of eloquently written synopses of this novel here on Amazon, so I will spare you another re-telling.  However, I would like to share why the title of my review has a double-meaning:<br /><br />I am indeed hungry to continue reading the trilogy--I read this book in one evening and will most likely knock the other two out this weekend.  The premise of the book was great, and with respect to the concepts of government abuse and the uglier aspects of human nature, I could easily draw parallels to our world today.  I found the author's writing style to be engaging and relatable, much like her characters in the story.  And due to the abrupt, cliffhanger-ish ending I want to know "the rest of the story."<br /><br />This reminds me of why I'm still hungry...<br /><br />Maybe I've watched too many Tarantino movies or read too many Stephen King novels, but I was not blown away by the "goriness" or "brutality" that so many reviewers mentioned.  It's the overall theme of humanity gone wrong that I find most scary, not the physical acts of atrocity that were committed in the book.  That's innate fight-or-flight right there.  The heroine's struggle to survive didn't leave an indelible mark on my soul either, nor did the potential "love triangle" constructed by the author.  I appreciate a great romance as much as the next reader, but I distinctly recall thinking that I would've enjoyed the whole "first kiss vs. real first kiss with feelings" if I were still a teenaged girl.<br /><br />For me the mark of an engrossing book is if I lose all track of time and place, and the world falls away to the point where I don't hear or see anything but the characters.  I know many readers gave this book 5 stars, which for me means this book would've produced some sort of paradigm shift.  For me it was an enjoyable read, but I could also read it while performing other tasks, so instead I gave it 3 stars.
