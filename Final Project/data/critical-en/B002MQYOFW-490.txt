Interesting turn of events. Just shocked. This last book kept me reading at some points feeling that it was turning into a horror story. Overall, I'm sad about how everything came to an end. (I suppose this is when I'm have to write SPOILERS) I think like other reviewers we expected to be just as entertained by the characters we grew to love but this novel is like reading a whole new story with new characters. I understand the effects of devastating events but this is over kill and makes me feel depressed. I wouldn't recommend, even though you may really want to know what happens.
