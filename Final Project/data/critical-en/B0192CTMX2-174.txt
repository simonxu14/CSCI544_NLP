Not her best work.  I guess since she knew everyone would buy it anyway, she should just include everyting she liked- even long drawnout plotlines which did nothing to move the story along.  Reaching adolecent angst (which I suppose should be expected at 15) brings out nothing likable about any of the characters.  The only slightly interesting thread was the answer to the "who dies" question which was not only predictable- but unexciting or even emotional.  I am sure I will keep reading the series as I will have another 3 years to get interested again.
