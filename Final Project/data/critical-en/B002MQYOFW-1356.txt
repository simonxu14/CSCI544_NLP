After reading the first book I was hooked! Both the first and second book were captivating, to the point where I read both of them in one day! The third book...not so much...I had to force my way through it, like eating a giant bowl of vomit. It took me a week to finish it because it was so not interesting. What a let down this was!  I wish the author would have took their time with this one I stead of bulldozing through it, it could have been an amazing end to the trilogy :(
