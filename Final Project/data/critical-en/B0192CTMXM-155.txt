I ordered this book as a used hard cover. I've ordered a ton of used books on Amazon before and have had really great luck. I chose this book that was labeled in &#34;good&#34; condition, but it's definitely not. The outside has stains all over it, the writing on the spine is completely faded, and some of the pages are ripped out. Had I known this is what would qualify as &#34;good&#34; then I would have ordered a better quality one. I just assumed that if it said good quality then it would be in the type of shape that other books I have purchased. I would definitely say this is poor quality and on its last leg.
