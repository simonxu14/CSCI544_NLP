I had never heard of this book until the movie came out amidst fanfare and hype. I thought it was for kids until several of my professional friends revealed they had read and enjoyed it. So, bowing to a peer pressure of sorts, I started reading and was captivated by the storyline in this futuristic fantasy /social commentary. I read straight through - as my friends warned me I would want to do - and found it a quick, enjoyable read. My only problem is that the book ends in a sort of cliffhanger but I'm not that captivated that I want to read books two and three.
