Was looking forward to eading this, and then progressing to the other 2 in the trilogy, but having read this, will not bother with the sequels. Maybe it is my age, and sex but found the story and writing a little juvenile, and definitely geared for a younger  ( early &#62; mid teens  female reader/s.  Disappointing
