As with the 50 shades trilogy, I found that these books were overhyped and grossly underwhelming after I read them. To say they were NYT bestseller's is horribly overrated but as a whole they were decent reads. Maybe they should be considered as a top choice for a younger audience and not a 31 year old. But I needed to see the reason for the movies coming out.
