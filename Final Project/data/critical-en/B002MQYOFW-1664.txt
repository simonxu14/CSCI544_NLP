I ordered all three books so that I could just go from one book to another without skipping a beat...Mockingjay was such a disappointment. I don't know why writers when writing series spend so much time on description.  Most of this book was disjointed.  The ending was so anti-climatic that it was over and I mean all of a sudden it was over.  War is ugly people die people rebuild...but the way she described the rebels the capital her life with Peeta and children was like reading crib notes for a test.  No substance or wait I take that back...when she did have Katniss and the rest of the characters interact it was exciting, sad, happy she made you wish for them to live she took you right there.  That indeed was wonderful...then it was abruptly over no further explanation other than to go on about something else which made me wonder if she did this to fill pages...<br />Nonetheless I will still recommend this trilogy but warn people not to get too excited about book 3 :(
