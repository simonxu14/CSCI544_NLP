I found the 3rd book a little slow, and not as interesting. There are allot of metaphors in these books, that are clearly understood by adults, and reflect our modern world. There are good lessons to be learned here, and I have to say I felt like the ending of the 3rd book was a bit rushed, in its conclusion.
