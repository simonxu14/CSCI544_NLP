It's so so sad.  As a huge Potter fan from the beginning and waiting 10 years with anticipation of the climatic series final, I can't help but feel betrayed, let down and honestly somewhat nauseated.<br />It's such a shame she either got tired of writing, or just plan greedy, but to destroy such a brilliantly gifted story, it's deplorable.  Clearly, this last book was not well planned and is a complete antithesis of the other six books.  Each character is nearly a shell of it's former self, taking on characteristics that are disturbingly erroneous.<br />Where was Fawkes?<br />And now with the latest revelation about Dumbledore, she seriously needs to shut her mouth now that the series is complete and let people's imagination take hold.  Leave it alone!<br />I for once am speechless, all I can do is shake my head.
