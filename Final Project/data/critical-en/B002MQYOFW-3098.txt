I know that this is geared toward the young adult crowd and I knew that going into it. I wasn't expecting great writing here, just a Harry Potter level, dystopian future, novel. Blah...what a waste of time. The main character is such a whiney little brat that she is completely unsympathetic. Would not recommend.
