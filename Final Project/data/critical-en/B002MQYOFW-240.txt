MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about this book.  Overall, I liked the story and the direction it went.  It made sense.  Unlike some here, I understood/appreciated the ending and was glad it wasn't a fairy tale where everything ended hunky-dory.  That would not have fit the books at all.  The problem was that the writing sometimes bogged the story down.<br /><br />At the beginning, I was very annoyed with Katniss because she was being dumb...I understand this is a general statement and that as a character, she has a right to do whatever, but the problem was that it did not seem to me to fit her character...it was almost like it was an out-of-body experience.  I didn't understand why she would have a feud with Haymitch.  They understand each other and she is smarter than the way she is portrayed in the first few chapters of the book.  But that was a minor problem.<br /><br />I think the big downer for me was a lack of detail, especially as they were fighting their way to the Capitol.  In the first two, I could picture everything and see what was happening.  During this sequence, everything felt so rushed that I just did not have a good picture of what was going on.  Maybe that was intentional to give the feeling that Katniss might have been having, but it did not feel that way.<br /><br />All in all, this book is definitely different from the first two.  The last two I was engrossed in and had trouble putting down.  This one I still had trouble putting down, but mainly just because I wanted to see how everything ended, not because the book kept me super interested.  Maybe I'll like it better if I read through the series again.  We'll see.  It's a good book, but it could have been better.
