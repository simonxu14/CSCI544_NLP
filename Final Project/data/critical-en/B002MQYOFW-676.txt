It is very difficult, most of the time, to separate ones reaction to the setting from ones reaction to the story and characters. However, I think my reactions to this book can be divided rather sharply into these two categories.<br /><br />The setting is incredibly stupid. Even though the author kept it fairly surreal I was never able to suspend my disbelief well at all. I have seen much better settings utterly demolished in reviews, especially on the SF newsgroups on UseNet. District Twelve, give me a break. Neither the Capitol or the districts make any sense at all. Nor does the proposed society.<br /><br />It is all just an excuse to create the terrible, beautiful and eventful story. And the story is all that. I was never bored. When I was not being irritated unto death by the setting I was being propelled along by the characters and what was happening to them.<br /><br />Speaking of the characters, some of the minor characters are extremely fine. To echo A. E. Houseman, "With Rue my heart is laden." In fact that poem is appropriate when thinking of the young people, even the ones in whom the games brought out their worst natures, sactificed to this evil society.<br /><br />When I just reviewed Michael Chabon's _Summerland_ (an even better juvenile) I mentioned the life lessons in the book. I think it is only fair to say that there are strong lessons in this book too. Lessons of loyalty and courage and also of not pre-judging people or at least not acting on those pre-judgments until you have a chance to see if they are wrong.<br /><br />So I am giving the setting a one and the story a four. Which would average out to 2.5 but the story is more important.<br /><br />I had expected some of the horrors of this setting to be redeemed in the sequel(s) Having read the first sequel, I think that is going to be true.
