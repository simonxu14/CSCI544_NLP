Probably my least favorite book in the series. The overall way it ended was fine but there was something about this that just seemed to drag on and on. The characters internal angst practically leaks out of the pages. I also thought some of the things that happened oddly out of place/pointless, like the impromptu music video of the 'mockyingjay'. I think you could honestly cut the book down by half and still get as much of a story out of it.
