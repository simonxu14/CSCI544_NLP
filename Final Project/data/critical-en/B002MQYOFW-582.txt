I couldn't put down the first two books. This book, on the other hand, was nothing but war sequence after war sequence. I think she could've left out half of it and we still would've got the point. The characters that we were all so invested were not the focus. Hated that after all the lead up, that anticlimactic ending is the last thing I'll remember of this great trilogy.
