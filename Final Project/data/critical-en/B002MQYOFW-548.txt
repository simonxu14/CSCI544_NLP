I came to The Hunger Game series very late, after the release of the third film; which meant I was able to read all three books in rapid succession.  The weakest of the three is Mockingjay; reading as though the author had written it as an early draft in which she was putting down the bold strokes of where she wanted to go with the intention of coming back to add order, nuance and flesh out  detail... and then didn't.  The characters feel flatter than they did in the first two books and the story points frequently feel as if they're going past with little to anchor the them.<br /><br />It's not a bad read and goes quickly; though at times it felt so shallow that I found myself flipping through the end of the book looking for who knows what.
