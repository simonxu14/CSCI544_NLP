At first I thought this book was so amazing and everyone who didnt like it was a loser, but as I thought more about this book i found more and more flaws that make this book confusing and unrealistic in so many ways. Dont get me wrong though the writing style is fantastic and to see this dystopian world was very interesting.<br /><br />Here are the flaws. First off there is no way that the whole continent thought it was sick but did nothing about it.Slavery went on for decades in the U.S but people tried to stop it from happening atleast because some people dont have to be taught that owning someone is wrong. Some how cinna is the only one in the whole entire population of the capitol who knows this is sick but he is a stylist for the the very thing he thinks is horrible? It gets better to he even said he would bet on katniss to win any way so i guess he condradicts himself making this character confusing and i really have no idea how to connect to this character like your supposed in good books because his actions and words do not speak the same thing. i dont know what his motives are or his personality.<br /><br />Second is that the author wrote a very mature premise for teenagers? There was a lot of potential in this book. I think Battle Royale and Divergent really captured that. So once again she basically tried to make healthy icecream and everyone loved it.....wtf.<br /><br />Third katniss is very selfish and mean. She could not have won unless other people helped her in every single scnario in the games.she wouldnt have gotten away from clove if it werent for th boy from district9. She wouldnt have killed glimmer if it werent for rue. she wouldve been dead if it werent for thresh. etc etc. Apparently she is a strong female role. Bitch do something yourself then you can be a strong female role.<br /><br />Fourth I really wanted to know more but i couldnt because she was so vague on her dystopian world i was confused when i kept reading the series. Koushan Takami (author of &#34;battle royale&#34;) and Veronica Roth (author of &#34;divergent&#34;) created their dystopian worlds in clear way so i didnt have to make up parts of the novel so it would make sense like the hunger games. For instance you only saw maybe half the people die in the book and i wanted to know what happened to half the other tributes.Or maybe the setting i wanted to know because North america doesnt really cut it. a map of panem would have been really helpful so i could know how big each district is or if the capitol is half the population or not because that would explain why nobody revolted earlier but that does bring up how in the world did they beat the capitol? there are so many question about this world but the book doesnt bring answers.<br /><br />So i conclude with this i thought it was okay not even good and i have so many questoins about this book i really want some answers or opinions about this.
