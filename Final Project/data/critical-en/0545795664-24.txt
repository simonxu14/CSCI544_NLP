I love the content in this book and my 6 year old son can't keep his hands off this book BUT, therein lies the problem.  The pages come out way too easy.  It's 400 or so pages and after about a month, a good 50 pages have fallen out of the book.  He still manages to carry it around and shove the pages back inside but the book looks like it's been around for 50 years.  I do not believe it is my son being rough with the book more than it is the pages being cheaply bound.
