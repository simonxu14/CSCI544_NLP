You'll understand why the series ends the way it did, but that won't make you feel any better. I won't put any spoilers in my review, however, I'll say this was the only book in the series I had to FORCE myself to finish. I didn't find myself quickly flipping through the pages because I was entangled in the plot. No. This time I flipped through at such a fast rate to get the miserable story to it's conclusion.<br /><br />The ending. While, I did somewhat get the outcome I'd hoped for, the circumstances of how the characters got to said point are so over-the-top, matter-of-fact, but almost unexplained that you can't help but feel a bit swindled + empty afterwards. It's like the author knew she cheated her readers so she threw together a weak last chapter + epilogue to soothe our expected disapproval. Like she got tired of her own series, realized she killed off too many great characters for questionable reasons + needed to make it up to us + herself, somehow.<br /><br />I do, however, understand why it ended this way. Katniss, Peeta, Haymitch, etc. all went through such terrible things + war really DOES change people. And great people (or characters) are often times casualties of war at the expense of others' "master plans." I get that. Still, this is a book, + I feel like we + the characters were entitled to a better, more fulfilling ending after this long, destructive journey we've been on together.<br /><br />But, maybe the author did get the ending SHE wanted since we all feel so strongly about how things turned out. Not everything ends like the movies + Panem was no fairy tale land. However, I hope the film version of this particular book is different + feels like a more appropriate end to the story. I hope.
