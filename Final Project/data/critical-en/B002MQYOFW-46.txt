The book is decent. It is not amazing though, and Collins is raking way more money than she should off these books. There are a lot of flaws in this series. I suppose I'll just list the pros and cons.<br /><br />-SPOILERS AHEAD-<br />-I REPEAT, SPOILERS AHEAD-<br />Pros:<br />-The few interesting characters: Peeta, Haymitch, and Finnick.<br />-The ending was exciting and surprising, despite being overly vague.<br />-It gave a realistic and didactic depiction of how terrible war is and how cruel people can be.<br />-The depressing nature of the series did, in fact, touch me, especially near the end of Mockingjay.<br />-Parts of the novel were very well written.<br />-The first book was amazing.<br />-She chooses Peeta (thank God).<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. The characters: First of all, there are waaay too many characters introduced in this small series of books. Especially the last one. A lot of these characters are basically nothing more than names, although I suppose that makes them easier to kill off in order to build faux suspense. And then a lot of the characters that actually are important aren't developed very well. Didn't anyone else find it odd how Prim would go from acting and talking like an 8 year old to saying things that are incredibly mature? Coin is never developed enough to make her assassination justifiable. Katniss comes off rather whiny. Gale is unlikable. And most others can be described entirely in just a few words.<br />2. The love triangle: Very forced. We barely see Gale in the first two books. By the third book, he and Katniss just come across as two childhood friends who outgrow each other. Peeta has always been the kind, likable one, there to protect Katniss. I'm glad the resolution to the love triangle was just an afterthought at the end of the novels, because I never really bought into it.<br />3. Uninteresting plot/poor pacing: This was a problem in the second book too, where it seems as though nothing happens until Part III of the novel. Katniss really just spends the first 2/3 of the book chilling in District 13 and filming "propos." Btw, there really isn't much suspense in the novel as the rebels seem to be easily winning the war and taking over the districts. The only suspense I felt was during Katniss's failed mission to kill President Snow, and even then the suspense was weak in that it revolved majorly around the deaths of meaningless characters and felt rushed and poorly written.<br />4. The final events of the novel: Wtf? Some people claim that Katniss agreed to the last Hunger Games to gain Coin's trust. If this is implied in the book, it is done VERY vaguely, and we would also have to make a BIG assumption that Haymitch was in on it too. Also, I still have no idea why the children were bombed. What I got out of the book was that Coin did it in order to shorten the length of a war she was already bound to win, which is difficult to understand considering how it makes no logical sense.<br />5. Pointing out symbolism: Collins clearly doesn't think much of her audience when she explicitly states the meaning of a majority of the symbols and metaphors. For example, making multiple comparisons between the assault on the capitol and the Hunger Games. We get it.<br />6. Delving into Katniss's thoughts: I know it's written in first person, but that doesn't mean we need to read pages of Katniss's over-analysis of unimportant events (while leaving out Katniss's thoughts where they matter, such as at the end of the novel).<br />I suppose this review was more critical than it had to be, but then again, these books are more popular than they should be.
