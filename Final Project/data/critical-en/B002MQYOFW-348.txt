I loved the first two books of the "The Hunger Games" trilogy, but was very disapppointed in the third book, "Mockingjay." It's unrelievably dark and violent, with no bright spots anywhere. I won't give the plot away, just don't get too attached to very many characters, most of them won't be there by the end. A large group of children gets slaughtered horribly, people fall into the "meat grinder", people's skin gets torn off, people get addicted to "morphling", they get eaten by ghastly "mutts", and on and on. The writing slogs along as if the author ran out of her original good idea and just grimly powered on to the end. Even the decision by Katniss as to who she really loves is flat, with the reason given in just a couple of sentences. I realize the author is trying to make a point about war and violence, but she herself commits plenty of it here. I can't believe this is marketed to 13 year olds.
