I loved the first 2 books, but the last one is just so freaking depressing and horrible for everyone.  I really liked the characters and she tortured them in the last book.  Really?  You couldn't find a way to resolve the whole thing, even with the same essential elements without torturing the characters I liked, Suzanne?  It should be filed in horror. And the last book is so violent, I would not allow my child to read it, ever.
