Saw the first movie and liked it.  Grabbed this trilogy when it was on sale.  Still haven't seen the second and third movie.  Book three seemed anticlimactic, but still was a nice read.  I will watch the movies when they get to Amazon Prime or Netflix. I guess the suspense was lighter than I'm tend to like, though I was surprised at the end so that was good.
