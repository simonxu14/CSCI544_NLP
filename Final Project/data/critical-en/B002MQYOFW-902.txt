I liked the first 2 books. But this one seemed like the author was getting tired of writing. I kept waiting for the action and then well into the last few chapters it finally starts only to let you down. All the action that could have been written about is just brushed over and katniss is told about it after she recovers.. Most of the action happens and your just told its over and here is what the results are. If this had been the first book, I would have never finished it.
