I enjoyed the Hunger Games  as much as possible for a retired person in his 60s.  A few too many deus ex machina twists to merit a higher rating from me.  I mainly wanted to see what the fuss was about in the younger set.  The fact I made it to the end is a positive for this book--it just wasn't written for my demographic.
