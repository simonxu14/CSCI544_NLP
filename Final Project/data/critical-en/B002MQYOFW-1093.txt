I wasn't to impressed. The middle was way dragged out and boring. The end was to fast and dropped off. The Mockingjay basically lost her charicature.  I would of like to elaborate more on peeta and katness better, especially making peeta say and do those horrible things and then he comes back to district 12 and they settle. No anything on his part??  I especially didn't care about how Snow died.
