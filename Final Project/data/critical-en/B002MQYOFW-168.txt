The conclusion of the Hunger Games trilogy had much to live up to. The first novel, a book which deserves all of the attention and much of the praise which it has received, delivers a breathtaking and tragic world for the remainder of the series to fill. Its characters, plot points, and themes are well-established and thoroughly explored in the first book.<br /><br />The second novel kept up the quick pace and surreal division between the elite and the impoverished which had characterized the first. It revitalized and cashed in on the intellectual property in intriguing ways. The story further explores the internal dynamics of major character relationships, and forces the reader into uneasy alliances that ultimately reward. But in my opinion, it is in the ending chapter of Catching Fire where the series began to unravel.<br /><br />Where we had before a strong, driven protagonist throughout the first and majority of the second novel in Katniss, by the end of Catching Fire our lens into the nation of Panem has begun to morph into a simpering, self-consumed girl. Her angst strays from relationships to how those relationships define her, but in unsurprising and largely uninteresting ways.<br /><br />So it is with disappointment that I state that the third novel feels like only so much more navelgazing interspersed with often contrived plot points. Still, I felt the urge to read on. It wasn't until the final chapters that my disappointment with the tone developed into a simple failure of disbelief when, in the events leading up to the final conflict, the book forces a character into an inexcusably poor death. That death feels like it was contrived simply to drive home a hamfisted message about our current world, but the message falls flat on its face simply because I'm left with more questions than answers about the death which is supposed to establish this externalization.<br /><br />****SPOILERS: DO NOT READ IF YOU WANT TO KEEP THE MYSTERY INTACT****<br />Prim dies. And she dies ingloriously. She dies because she's forced onto the front lines as a medic to help Capitol kids who, apparently, the Rebels bombed. A second set of bombs, delayed to go off to kill the aid who comes to help the survivors of the initial explosions, wipe out a Prim who should not be in the Capitol. Her presence is never really explained, but waved away by narrative magic. It's insulting, and it doesn't make sense. My frustration isn't that Prim dies; it's that she dies in so utterly contrived a way.<br /><br />It's not that her death is meaningless; if Prim had died in a random attack, I would have been infuriated but struck by the notion that nobody's a superhero and the people we imagine we would fight to save might die simply "because." No, it's not that Prim's death is meaningless - it's the opposite. It's overzealously portrayed as metaphorical and meaningful. Prim dies in a forced juxtaposition to the opening scenes of the series, to underscore the author's moral. It underwhelms and steals so much energy from a novel already enervated by a moping protagonist. It sucks. I don't know how else to say it. I want to say it at least sets up some great narrative denouement, but the realization that it sucks to live in a world where we use children as pawns isn't all that surprising.<br /><br />You may still enjoy the book. And if I were you, I'd read it anyway simply because I DEVOURED the first two novels and would STILL need to know what happened. I give Collins that: her world was so impressive that I simply had to see it resolved. But in the eleventh hour, the author made a terminal mistake: she sacrificed a character for the sake of a moral. It reads like bad sentimentalism, and the fact that our protagonist has been moping around and paying attention to other characters only insofar as they directly affected her certainly doesn't help.
