I maybe late in getting my two-cents in but I'm putting them in. The book is definitely misplaced as a Young Adult genre since children killing children as a government mandate entails a lot of explanations to young adults. As a cautionary tale this is just a retelling of events in the past and maybe the present times where the lessons in bureaucracy and hierarchy are never learned. Individual independence is probably a sign of self-possession but living in a collective is a worst state because it always tends to become a pyramid with all the levels and weak points.<br /><br />"We're fickle, stupid beings with poor memories and a great gift for self-destruction."---Plutarch
