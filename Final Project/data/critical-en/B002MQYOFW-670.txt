The hypothesis of these books intrigued me enough to overlook a couple of missing things that, had they been there, could have made them brilliant. Given our seeming obsession with Reality TV the idea of the world in the book is just a great notion and so the concept of these books make them kind of the Brave New World/1984 of our age. The Hunger Games books don't have the depth, so therefore the brilliance, of those just mentioned but they are still worth a read. A great idea and imagination behind them certainly.
