I have to admit I was disappointed in the last book of this generally outstanding series. The action was disjointed, Harry's feelings, motives, and actions often failed to ring true (or were inadequately developed), and the last chapter weakened the ending. Sorry to disagree with the majority on this, but I think that when the excitement fades, people will find this last book the least interesting to reread.
