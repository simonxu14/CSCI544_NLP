I loved the hunger games. I also enjoyed the 2nd book in the series very much! I was excited to start this one and get a conclusion to the story. While I don't mind the ending, seems very realistic to go with the story line, I did have a harder time following this books ending. It seemed rushed and the details didn't all make sense in how they went. While I am glad that I read the series, I do feel that this was the weakest book in the series. It felt different than the other two that came before it. Wile I think it should still be read, it was a longer read than the other two
