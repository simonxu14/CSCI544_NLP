Let me start off by saying that my best friend told me that this is the best series in the world and that I would love it more than anything I have ever read. So when I started reading the series I was so excited and couldn't wait to finish them.<br /><br />That is pretty much as far as my excitement got. I can honestly say that I did kinda sorta like the first 2 books. There was humor that the author just slipped in that gave me a good laugh and there was action that made me keep flipping the pages. However the main reason I kept pushing through until the end was to find out what happens. I was also hoping to get info about the state of the rest of the world and not just the 13 districts. No such luck.<br /><br />At the end of the 3rd book I felt like I had just wasted several hours of my time. I could have read a few free Kindle books instead of this series I had just paid for. I really wish I hadn't of wasted my time/money on this series.<br /><br />But obviously plenty of people love this series, hence the ratings and the movie that is in production. I am just not one of them. Hopefully you enjoy it more than I did!<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: I recommend The Host by Stephenie Meyer over this any day. I am not a huge sci-fi person but I do love that book. Not exactly the same story line, but it does deal with the human race being threatened.<br /><br />UPDATE as of 3/24/14: Love the movies! :)
