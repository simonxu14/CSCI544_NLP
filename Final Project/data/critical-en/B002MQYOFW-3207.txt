After reading so many reviews about this book, I finally decided to pick it up. I really don't get the hype. The main character was essentially a "mary sue". Tragic past, she has to face trials, blah blah blah. Who cares really. The writing was basic and nothing to talk about.  I don't even understand why this book deserved sequels since I'm not interested in what happens next. Well I'm happy I didn't pick up all three books at one time or I would have been highly upset.
