While I couldn't put the first two books in this series down for long, this final book was a little disappointing for me.  Too much reflection by Katniss and not as much action.  It seemed to muddle through to the ending.  Too much time elapses when she is trying to figure out how she's feeling at the end.  But still a good book. But I feel like if you haven't read the first two you'll be lost with a lot of the characters that she thinks about.
