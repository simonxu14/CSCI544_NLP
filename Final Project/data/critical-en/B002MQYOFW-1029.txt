I loved the first book. I saw the necessity of the choices in the second book. This book just gave up and started doing things just for the sake of doing them, not because they were necessary for the plot or because they were in any way justified by the prior actions of the characters. It would be like if Forrest Gump suddenly knocked out Lt Dan's legs and laughed at him. The ending was perfect and exactly what needed to happen, but there were a lot of things that preceded it that were just plain unsettling.
