Having seen the movie first, the book fleshed out several plot points and explained a few things the movie didn't touch on.  However, both the movie and even more so, the book are just way too violent.  The whole concept of the games assumes people can accept violence against children as entertaining.  Even though the book is for young adults, I can't accept that premise even in some future.
