To start, I enjoyed the first two books. I won't spend more time than I must on this review, and you shouldn't waste your time like I did reading the third book. I'm not sure what part I enjoyed more, the one where the rebel military was unable to repel an attack, yet Katniss and Gale had no problem shooting down hovercrafts with arrows; or the ending where Prim died and I laughed heartily outloud because I no longer cared about any character in the book. In short, don't read.
