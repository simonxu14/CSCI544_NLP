I bought the paperback version of the Hunger Games from Amazon for my granddaughter for Christmas.  When I asked her how she liked the story, she said she loved it, even though the pages were "all messed up".  I checked it out and she is correct.  Page 138 is followed by page 135.  Page 135 consists of a partially worded  sheet of paper glued to a blank sheet.  Page 135 is followed by page 140, then 145 which is repeated twice, once in its entirety and again as a partial sheet glued to another sheet.  Then comes pages 146, followed by 148.  Ultimately, all the pages are there; you just have to hunt for them.  After page 148 the pagination is back in the correct order.  I'm not sure how this occurred, but I did not buy this book as a "seconds", so I really expected it to be perfect, especially since it was a gift.  I'm glad she liked the story, because the quality of the book itself is definitely second rate.
