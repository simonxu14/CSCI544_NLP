This book's contents are exactly what I expected and my child studies it in a way I wish he studied his schooling. UNFORTUNATELY it is falling apart at every page (very poor binding) and we have only had it for two months. Yes, the book is well loved, but not mistreated. I have never had a book fall apart so quickly and thoroughly as this one. If this is a few-and-far-between, I'd take a replacement, otherwise, it wouldn't be worth me replacing it.
