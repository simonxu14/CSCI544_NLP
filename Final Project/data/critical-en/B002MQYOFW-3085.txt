I read the first two books, The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, and was amazed. I really loved them. I didn't expect Catching Fire to be as good as The Hunger Games, but it SURPASSED it. I found Mockingjay on Amazon and decided to pre-order it. This was FEBRUARY 15TH. I expected that Mockingjay would be as good Catching Fire, if not The Hunger Games at least. I finally received my copy of Mockingjay August 26, and was thrilled. I read the first chapter, then put it down. I didn't pick it up for about a week.<br />God, I wish I hadn't picked it back up. I wish I could've just left it alone and conjured up my own ending in my head and have that be the end of it. Mockingjay was WAY below my expectations. Half of the characters I didn't even KNOW until they were dead. It was hard to follow because of the random characters being thrown into the mix, only to be killed off five, six, maybe seven pages later if they're lucky. And that strong girl, named Katniss, that appeared in the first two books? Gone. 80% of the book is her hiding somewhere and crying. That's what disappointed me the most, she was so easily broken.<br />Also, the ending. What the hell was with the ending? It was way too abrupt. Here's the ending:<br />Kids in one group.<br />Explosions go off.<br />Kids Die.<br />Second Explosion Kills Prim.<br />Katniss wakes in Snow's mansion and chats with him.<br />Katniss votes yes for Capitol Children Hunger Games.<br />Katniss shoots Coin.<br />Katniss goes to 12.<br />Katniss chooses Peeta.<br />Katniss has Kids.<br /><br />That's it. That's around the last 30 pages too?<br />Collins has left me dissapointed. I suggest making up your own ending.
