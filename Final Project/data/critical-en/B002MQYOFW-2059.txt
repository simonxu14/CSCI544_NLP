I purchased this book, because I was curious as to why people liked it so much. Honestly I found myself being bored with this book, and Suzanne Collins' style of writing did not draw me in. It's a good book for those who like action, but it did not appeal to me with the aspect of emotion. I like the idea as a whole and and the setting was well developed, but the characters did not do much for my taste.
