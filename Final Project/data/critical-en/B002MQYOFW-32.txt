SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />Okay, I basically rushed to Mockingjay, the final book in The Hunger Games trilogy because of the romance. Yes, it was scant throughout the first two books but still, I hoped that it would grow in the third. BOY, was I wrong. Romance? WHAT romance? The entire book was about Katniss in a complete meltdown. It was frustrating. When I read a fiction I want it to feel like a fiction. I don't want to relate, I don't want realistic. Anyway, Katniss, who was not very likeable to begin with became deplorable in her treatment of Peeta. In the first two books I found her rather patronizing toward him like he was weak, stupid, slow and only to be protected. In the final book she kept dismissing him like he meant nothing at all. I felt like she didn't deserve Peeta at all and in the end the supposed romance felt empty. I remain unconvinced that she ever loved him. Peeta barely existed in book 3. I applauded Gale leaving, at least he knew what a mess this girl was.<br /><br />Overall, the book was agonizing. Everything about it was agonizing. The meaningless deaths so coldly accounted (I cannot fathom the meaning of Finnick and Prim's death and how little they mattered in the end). It was heartlessly and cruelly portrayed. NO character development whatsoever. Nothing was explained, everything was revealed in vague one-liners. And the other characters? If they seemed muted in the other two books they completely disappeared in the final. I wish I had never read this book.
