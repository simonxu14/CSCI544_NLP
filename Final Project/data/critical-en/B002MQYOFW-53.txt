The first two books were great, but this last one is so sick and massively twisted, and no one is ever saved, just tortuered and murdered in the most horrible ways imagined, time after time after time.  Needed a lot more light for my liking.  Myself and my husband will never read or listen to this book again.  It is in the trash because we don't want anyone we care about to read it either.<br />Definitely NOT for young adults or older ones either.<br />I must say, so far, the movies are way better, they edited them perfectly!!
