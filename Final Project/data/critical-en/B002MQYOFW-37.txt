I'm late to this particular game, given as how I've only just now read the book, but I managed to avoid all of the hype and chatter that apparently accompanied both the book release and the movie release, and I was able to read the book without any preconceived notions.<br /><br />In short, this book is based on an intriguing premise, but never moves beyond being mildly entertaining on the most basic level. It is a very quick and light read, but that's not exactly the best approach to take to a theme which should be filled with moral ambiguities, gut-wrenching decisions (both literal and figurative), as well as social, political and philosophical challenges. If nothing else, the main characters could have been shown to struggle with these issues on a personal level, even if the author wanted to avoid having the book be too dense for younger readers. Instead, all of the complex tension which is hinted at in the beginning is deflated when the plot twists in every direction to avoid dealing with tough issues. For example, [SPOILER ALERT] when Katniss is forced into a gladiator's arena and is faced with killing both an endearing friend/love interest (Peeta) AND a young girl (Rue) that she takes under her wing, the reader is anticipating some genuinely thoughtful drama and character development; disappointingly, the author takes the easy way out by having Rue killed by a different tribute (in a barely plausible setting), and THEN having a bogus "rule change" occur in the middle of the games. Apologists will point out that the "rule change" was later rescinded, and yet it isn't realistic that Katniss and Peeta would have fought each other to the death as the last two contestants, whereas she may have let him die earlier in the games.<br /><br />Ultimately, a braver plot would have made this a better book, but wouldn't have overcome the two-dimensional functionality of most characters in the book, nor the lack of artistry in the style of writing. Also disappointing was how poorly the book was proofread and copyedited (at times I felt like I was reading a Yahoo News article). While three starts seems a wee bit generous, two stars would be unfair, so I went ahead and rounded up.
