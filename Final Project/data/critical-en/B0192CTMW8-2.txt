This book is in decent shape. No dust cover. The spine has been loosened up by what feels like 3 - 5 reads. Pages show only the slightest tinge of yellow, but are crisp and show no marring. The corners of the hardcover show obvious wear.<br /><br />The seller had my item shipped within 24 hours.<br /><br />On a personal note, I'm glad to have the hard copy of such a delightful book. You don't have to be a child to enjoy the story. In fact, reading them as an adult adds that extra bit of nostalgia to the experience. Even if you are not into fantasy, there are very powerful messages in this story that transcend the genre. The first three novels are very light reads and can be quite therapeutic at the end of the day.
