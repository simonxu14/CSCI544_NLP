The plot is really good! It is something new, and different.<br />It takes another twist that I had not forseen, after reading the first book. Therefor it is both thrilling and exciting with a lot of action and many good cjaracters.<br /><br />The writing though is not very well done, and sometimes the story a bit to shallow. It works for screenwriting and the whole theme is excellent for movies, but I wouldn't concider it a good read, regarding the writing itself.<br /><br />Still, if you enjoy something different, easy reading and sci-fi, then the books are not too bad.
