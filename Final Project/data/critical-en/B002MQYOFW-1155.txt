I loved the Hunger Games, stayed up late to read one more chapter, then another.  Book two wasn't bad, the third book seemed to be the same battles over and over again. ( I can't believe they intend to split that into two movies. Well, yes I can.)  I bought the books because everyone was reading them and I wanted to talk about them to young people in the family,  But I won't reread them, and gave them away..
