Deathly Hallows never really wowed me when I read it years ago, and it still doesn't wow me today. My main gripes of this book are as follows:<br /><br />1. Harry won't tell anyone about his mission to destroy the horcruxes. Only he, Hermione, and Ron know about what they are and how to destroy them. There are multiple points where the Minster of Magic asks Harry what he is up to, Professor Lupin, Mrs. Weasley, Charlie, and loads others. But Harry doesn't confide in anyone because of some misplaced honor he has. Half of the people who asked him could easily have helped him on the journey. I know Harry was worried about putting people in danger or having Voldemort find out, but people were already dieing and things were going wrong. How much worse could it get?<br /><br />2. The story drags quite a bit in the middle. It seems like Rowling wasn't sure how to advance the plot and just had Harry happen to overhear someone mention a person or place and he immediately decides to whisk himself off to that location. Everything just seems to contrived.<br /><br />3. There is waaay too much exposition. Too many instances where characters have to explain to great lengths what is happening in the story. What are the Deathly Hallows - well here is a two page story to explain it. Who is Grindlewald - another story. Was Dumbledore really a bastard - story time. The reader doesn't get a change to experience anything but instead gets told what to think and know. That is lazy writing. You should never have to explain things to the reader like that. The story should develop through the actions of the characters, not a page long description of why this is important. Granted this is a problem Rowling had since book 1 and introducing plot devices that were conveniently never mentioned in previous novels.<br /><br />The book isn't bad, but the middle suffers quite a bit. The beginning and end are brilliant, but just so much garbage happens in the middle.
