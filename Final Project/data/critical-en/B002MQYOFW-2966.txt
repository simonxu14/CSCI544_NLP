I love this book, this one is my most favorite of the series. My favorite part of this series is the romance between Katniss& Peeta ( Jennifer & Josh) I would recommend this not only book but series to everybody. I hate to read but, it took me 6 days to read all three books. I wish it could go on forever. This is the only series I have ever been into. And I look forward to seeing The Mockinjay in theatres.
