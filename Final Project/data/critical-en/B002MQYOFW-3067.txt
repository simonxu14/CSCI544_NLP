Overall I thought this was a good, but not great book.  The overall premise I felt was intriguing.  Some may find it hard to buy into though.  I felt the plot development was a little basic and formulaic, i.e. not many twist and turns and those that were there were pretty easy to spot beforehand.  I really would have liked a little more back story and more development into the other "Tributes".  Overall, while I enjoyed the book I just would have liked it more with some more depth.
