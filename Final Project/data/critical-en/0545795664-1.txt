This book is great overall. The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because all the Pok&eacute;mon are in alphabetical order! Honestly the worst idea ever. I've been a Pok&eacute;mon fan since Red/Blue up until the 3rd Gen. I'm not familiar with anything from 4th and up. So finding what Gen these Pok&eacute;mon are is impossible. Also unessesary to flip hundreds of pages just to get to an evolution. Having the Pok&eacute;mon in Pok&eacute;dex number would have saved many headaches.
