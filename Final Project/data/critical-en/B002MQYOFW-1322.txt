I read all three books in the series.  This was the least favorite.  The first one was a spellbinder.  By the third book I felt it was just all about the fantasy and the violence.  The first one the characters were more grounded in their humanity with just enough of fantasy to tease the intellect and the emotions.  Last book I could have done without.
