I was aghast that Katniss married Peeta!  She was so much better suited to Gale and she had a much better history with him.  It rather ruined the entire story.  And Katniss with children?  She couldn't have been much of a mother as she said she didn't want children, she just had them because Peeta wanted them!  Not a good reason!
