I just don't get all the high ratings and glowing remarks about this book.  I found the story very shallow and single-threaded.  The context is a brutal futuristic world served by oppressive government.  But that is not a new idea. The book is about a survival contest, but that is not a new idea either.  Hmmm?  Where did she get that idea?  And that is about it.
