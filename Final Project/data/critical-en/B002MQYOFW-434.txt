This books reads like it was written by the author's distant relative twenty years after book 2. It's disconnected, poorly paced and written without care. It's the opposite of the first two Hunger Games. It's a loathsome chore to read.<br /><br />Perhaps there is a good story here, but it's buried beneath pages of exhausting, meaningless exposition and endless whining. This is clearly some kind of first draft. Hopefully they hire a competent editor to take a machete to the text before its next edition.<br /><br />Despite my words, if you are a fan of the first two books, you WILL read this one. I suggest either finding someone else to summarize the book for you, or waiting for the movie. It surely won't be worse than the book.
