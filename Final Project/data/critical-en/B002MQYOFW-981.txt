(SPOILER ALERT!!!)<br />The book doesn't end as I had expected. Truthfully, I was bracing myself for some amount of tragedy... to Prim, Gayle or Peeta.  By the end of the 2nd book I was literally praying that Peeta is alive, but at about the midpoint of Mockingjay I was sorry that they hadn't just killed him off and be over with it.  I at least would've remembered him the way I loved him. Here's why I am disappointed:<br /><br />1. The 1st two books paint Katniss as emotionally impaired but pulls so much of herself out of her through her love for Prim and especially through Peeta's love for her.  In Mockingjay so much time is spent on the actually war and Katniss' interaction with new characters from the other districts at the expense of her relationships with the other much loved characters from the previous books.  A heavy underlying theme was the love between Katniss and Peeta.  I felt bitter and betrayed for that to be reduced to the last paragraph of the book and a 2 paged epilogue.  Not enough!<br />2. The characters became shadows of themselves:<br />  a. In Mockingjay the book takes a turn where Peeta becomes unrecognizable.  The love, the little interchanges, always putting her above himself just a good depiction of what love is, becomes pretty much non-existent.  By the end of the book, not all of him has returned.  I kept reading 1 line over and over to satisfy need to get their love back: "But his arms are there to comfort me.  And eventually his lips".  I'm still left wanting.<br />  b. For as much as Haymitch was a brute in the 2 previous books, I questioned his decisions but never his motive or allegiance.  I think his character was done a disservice in this instalment.<br />  c.  Gale who I was fed titbits about in the previous novels was a likeable character.  His anger and what he became was a surprise to me.  All along I was silently rooting for Peeta but feeling bad about how Gale would feel when he lost Katniss.  Two-thirds of the way through the book I was rooting against Gale.  I thought the author lost an opportunity to bring some "good tragedy" to the book based on the fact that Katniss would now have to choose between someone who is good for her and someone who is better.  And how Gale exited her life was sad if not unrealistic. That friendship should've endured.  Makes me sad... and a bit annoyed.<br />  d.  Some of the other characters that weren't among the main characters but added richness to the book got a mere one line mention... like Madge (who I was secretly hoping Gale would fall in love with) and Gale's family that give him a more human touch.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I do believe that the Capitol turning Peeta was a good twist.  I however expected him to be deprogrammed... and that it wouldn't take the whole book to get it done.  I also thought that the play for power was very true to life (Coin/Snow).  I do think the book was still a good book.  I however feel that it failed to live up to the expectations created by its predecessors.
