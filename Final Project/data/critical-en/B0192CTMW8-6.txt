First of all I must say that I absolutely adore every Harry potter book there is and my rating has nothing to do with the book and only with the transaction. I was sent an entirely different book which had a Harry potter bar code on it. I had to return the book but they were not able to send me the correct book, just refund my money. I had gotten a good deal on the book and was disappointed that they didn't just send me the right book instead of refund my money.
