This was a good conclusion to the series. The end of the book wraps things up nicely and I enjoyed the conclusion. I didn't move through this book as fast as the previous two. I didn't feel it had the same level of excitement as the other ones, but the last third of the book is very fast paced. I recommend reading this one if you have read the first two since it does wrap everything up in a thoughtful way.
