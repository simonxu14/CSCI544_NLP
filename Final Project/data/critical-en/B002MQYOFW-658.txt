I didn't enjoy the first book or most of the second book, but I fell in love with the story during the second half of the third book. Most people bored with a series would just walk away, but I had to know what the hype was about. While I applaud the change in pace and the way the action at the end of Mockingjay breathed life into this trilogy, it took entirely too long to get there. I don't love this trilogy. I don't even consider it something I would read again someday. I do, however, consider it worthy of at least one read by anyone who loves dystopian thrillers. As someone who doesn't, I found very little to love, but what I did find made reading the series worthwhile.
