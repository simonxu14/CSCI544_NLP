I enjoyed the hunger games and catching fire very much. There were a lot of descriptions and insights into human emotions as well as plenty of action. Collins made it easy to relate to the characters and understand the nature of their dilemmas- even if we, ourselves, have never had such experiences. Mockingjay, I feel, could have been really good. I can definitely appreciate the ending and Katniss' decisions. However, I feel that the final battle/war scene is so anticlimactic. ***SPOILERS AHEAD*** I don't know if the reader, upon reflecting back, really believes that a 17 year old girl and her crew of 4, will, by themselves, bring an end to the war and destroy President Snow. But I was expecting more than a slight recap of the final moments of the war as told by Katniss while she recovers from the explosion. It was getting really exciting up until that point and then the narrative just kind of cuts off and leaves you hanging, unfulfilled- the story unresolved. I also wasn't very satisfied with how the author ends things with Katniss and Peeta. It makes sense that Katniss takes a lot of time to heal and find the strength to move forward, but I would have liked more than 2 pages of explanation on how Katniss and Peeta come together. There was no dialogue between them. Again, anticlimactic. From the previous books we already know how Peeta regards Katniss and how her feelings toward Peeta changes and grows. I don't really know how to explain my feelings towards this book, other than there seems to be something missing. Suffice it to say, this book was not as thorough or complete as the other 2 books. Overall though, I would recommend this series and think that it is an entertaining and engrossing read.
