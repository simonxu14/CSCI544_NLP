I bought this book just to find out what happens to the characters. By the time I finished the second book I was very disappointed in the Collins' almost elementary writing style and almost felt ashamed paying for this novel. While the story takes you to a new world from the first two novels and packs pretty surprising twists, ultimately it devolves into Pulp Fiction, leaving the reader wishing they had stopped after the first book.
