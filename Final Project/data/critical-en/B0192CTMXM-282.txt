I agree with a reviewer from Vermont about the story starting off a bit slow and not having a recap intro that allows the book to stand alone on its own merits without having to read any of the other books.  The first quarter of the book didn't make me want keep reading like the other books did.  After that, though, I found it more compelling and harder to put down.  It must be hard to wrap up a story line like this and keep the same sense of momentum.  Take for instance the Star Wars and Matrix movies final episodes. However, thanks to Ms. Rowling for an overall great ride.
