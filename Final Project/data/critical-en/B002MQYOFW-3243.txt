For this book, Mockingjay, one might think that it would follow the other two in that it has tons of killing, scary moments, and fake public love for the tv....not only does this book not have that....it is also kinda boring.  Well first of all whats her face became so not memorable i literally cannot remember her name and Peeta is her every other thought even after he tries to kill her.  I mean seriously if somebody tried to kill me I wouldn't forgive them.  But back to the book it was mediocre I personally thought that it should have been more like the other two and have an actual Hunger Games to it and not just talk about how some situations remind her of the Games...booorrrriinnnnggg!
