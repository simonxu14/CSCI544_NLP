This review is likely to be buried within moments of my hitting the "save" button.  So I will waste no ones time.<br /><br />This is a great book for young people, likely ages 10-14.  The rage about the "tie-in" to the adult community was one I simply did not see or read anywhere in this book.  Sure there were puns that most kids wouldn't get but adults reading this, tst tst tst on you.  Spend your time reading something of substance.  But rest assured your children are in good hands with Rowling's characters, plot and retro-zest.  I wanted to see what the rage was about, and after reading it I can only say that in this over-hyped world we live in, some reviewers might be afraid to pan this book.  I am not.  THIS IS NOT FOR INTELLIGENT ADULTS.  It is for children.<br /><br />After writing this, I am confident that if I get any "feedback" it will be negative as people only want to vote with those they agree, not with those who read the book with an open mind and came away with a different take.  Move on.  Read Norris, Russo, Roth, Steinbeck.  Read real literature, not some rage that feeds on itself.
