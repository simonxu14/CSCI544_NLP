I don't like when my son uses the word &#60;hate&#62;. But it was my first thought when I unpacked the book. It was in a truly ugly condition, the cover was torn in many places, the pen writings were on the side of the book, in the book, on the spine of it, yes, all over the book. It looked so worn and dirty that my son refused to read it. The book itself is a masterpiece. People, don't sell the garbage! Think of the little kids who are about to open an amazing world of literature, don't make them hate reading selling books in such an awful condition!
