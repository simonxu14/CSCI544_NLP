What Harry Potter did to Tolkien and what Twilight did to Stoker, The Hunger Games does to post-apocalyptic science fiction. That is, treat it as a setting for adolescent romance with pedestrian and formulaic prose. All that said, it IS a decent children's book.<br /><br />It's not a terrible book; I'm not saying that.  But it IS being lauded well beyond its station.
