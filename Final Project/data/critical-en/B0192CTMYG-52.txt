I purchased this book, because I'm trying to become fluent in Spanish. I am already proficient, but nowhere near fluent. So I wanted to read this as my first Spanish novel, and I was very eager to begin reading, but upon delivery I noticed a big problem. The book is written in Castellano, Spanish from Spain. I have learned, as do most people in the U.S., Latin American Spanish. The gist is the same, and anyone from Latin America would be able to read it fine, but it's Greek to me. The copyright page says it clearly inside the book, but it is not listed in the description on Amazon. It's possible I could have over looked the detail, but from going back and looking, I can't seem to find anything listing the correct language. I love Harry Potter, and I love Spanish. I wish I could read this, and I will definitely try, but it is not what I thought I was purchasing.
