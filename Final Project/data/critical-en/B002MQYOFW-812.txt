I realize this isn't Tolstoy, but give me a break.  The pages and pages of Katniss' anger, her ambivalence toward Peeta and Gale (neither of whom she deserves), the endless ranting and raving makes me sick.  To be fair, Collins' page filling was better than the awful hash that Rowling made of the last Harry Potter novels.  Rowling  was obviously bored to death with Harry, but Collins just doesn't know how to write about rage well, and is too old to remember the plight of being a teenager thinking about love.  So we have to suffer through, or skip endless dialogue relating Katniss' internal strife.  OMG, we get it.  Katniss is experiencing PTSD, and constant hormonal imbalances.  Now move on, nothing to see here!<br /><br />To her credit, she is inventive and the battle in the Capitol was interesting, but not as good as the arena in book one.  This is a great book for younger readers and people who don't expect  the level of a Thomas Hardy novel, which Collins should read to find out how a great writer deals with internal strife and the unfairness of the world.
