i can't believe rowling kept the world waiting for 3 years only to give us a book where harry potter regresses into a 5 year old and whines for 3/4 of the book.  ron's stage fright was also over-the-top. the only reason i can recommend for getting this book is that you have to read it in order to know what happened for the next one.  that is, if you're not totally turned off the series by the poor writing in this one.
