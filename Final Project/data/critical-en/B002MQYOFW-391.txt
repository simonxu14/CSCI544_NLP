I read the first two books of the trilogy in less than 2 days, and Mokingjay took me days. I found this book to be sloppy with a lack of plot resolution.<br /><br />In the end, here's my ultimate opinion: you need to read this to close the Hunger Games trilogy in your mind. I don't think you will ultimately love the book, but everyone needs closure (unless you happen to be Katniss).
