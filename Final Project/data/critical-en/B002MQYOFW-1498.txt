The first 2 books were amazing. The third book, I felt Katniss should have stepped up her game a bit. My biggest disappointment was anytime something interesting was about to happen, Katniss almost always blacks out or gets hysterical and has to be sedated. It gets annoying. I liked the ending though. My least favorite of the 3 for sure.
