Before you read, I do have some SPOILERS in here. Don't say I didn't warn you. Let me just say I liked the final Harry Potter book, but I was disappointed. After endearing these characters to us over the last ten years, she leaves us with very little closure with some of the characters we have grown to love. What about the Weasleys who have a child to bury? Who became Headmaster or Headmistress of Hogwarts? What happened in the aftermath of the battle? What jobs did Harry, Ron, and Hermione have when they were older. We know very little about their lives. I wanted a little more information about the characters I've become so fond of. It was a bit of a disappointing ending to such an enchanting story.
