I enjoyed the book for the most part. I knew this book wouldn't be a happy ever after fairytale but I feel that the author put so much description in the first 20 chapters and then all of a sudden decided to end it. It would have been nice to hear more about Haymitch or hear what Gale's new job was in District 2 or even how Peeta and Katniss find each other again, instead it is just a "so they did and that is the end" kind of ending. I am not sure how they are going to make 2 movies out of this book. I hope they put a little more thought into the ending. I was left without feeling closure for these characters. Book 2 by far is the best of the 3. Looking forward to the movie in November.
