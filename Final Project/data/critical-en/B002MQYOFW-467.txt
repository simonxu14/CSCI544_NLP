I hate books that revolve around a deux a machine to resolve the stories plot. I wanted to finish this journey with these characters and I wasn't looking for a classic happy ending or all the loose ends to be tied. But let's just say, there was some interesting character development in this last installment. Perhaps you will agree with the character arcs, I just didn't.
