I dove into Hunger Games with great anticipation.  I was soon expecting the heroine, an expert bow hunter with advanced field-craft skills, to go on the offensive against her adversaries.  My enchantment gradually shifted from excitement to disappointment as she remained passive, only reacting to immediate threats in basic ways.  The story eventually petered out into a romance novel - left hanging.
