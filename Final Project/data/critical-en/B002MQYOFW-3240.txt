I ordered the hunger games trilogy box set. It still hasn't been shipped. I ordered it on March 29th. I am extremely dissatisfied that its taken this long and there still isn't any in stock. I just think its ridiculous that its taken this long and its still not in stock. it really makes me not want to order anything from amazon ever again. I mean why cant they get more in stock. hunger games is extremely popular right now, you would think they would have books in stock or that it wouldnt take this long to get more in stock. i am so unbelievably annoyed!
