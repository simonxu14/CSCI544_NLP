***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***<br /><br />It's like this book wasn't even written by the same author.  Without a true hunger games to help mold the book, the author seemed lost.  The whole first half of the book drags on and when there finally is some action, its very linear and predictable.  An extremely disappointing end to what was a great series up to this point.  How they are going to make 2 movies from this trash is beyond me.  I imagine they will have to take a lot of creative liberty.
