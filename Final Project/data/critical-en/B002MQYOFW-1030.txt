Collins created an interesting world and an interesting message in her three books, but in this last book she took Katniss, wonderfully strong young woman&#60; and completely changed her character. I was disappointed in the last book:  too many throw-away deaths, too much of Katniss wandering around being &#34;mentally disoriented.&#34;
