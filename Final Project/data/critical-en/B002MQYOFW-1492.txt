I've read all three and i enjoyed the first book. It was a fun, light read. I am amazed at how many reviewers think this is a great work of art. It's not. I think books 2 and 3 in the series are repetitive. So, I'd suggest you might want to skip the next two books if you agree with my opinion of the first. But if you think Collins is our next Hemingway, read on.
