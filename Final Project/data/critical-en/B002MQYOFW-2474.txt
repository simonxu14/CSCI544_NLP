My daughters and I have read all three of this series and this last book is the most disappointing. We loved the first two but this last book was very different from the first two. One of my daughters had to take a break from reading it because it was so slow moving and I agree with her. Katniss changed so much from the first book, even the second book. I really thought she would be a heroine but the last book does her such an injustice. The end was just too tidy and felt like Ms. Collins just wanted to finish it up.<br /><br />On the positive the emotions and descriptions were beautiful and really took the reader into the book. It was during the slow moving sections that I wished Ms. Collins would have included more emotions. I will not let this last book spoil our liking of the writing style and my daughters and I will continue to read more of Collins' work.
