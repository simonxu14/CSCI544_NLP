SPOILER ALERT (read this after you've read the book)<br />I started reading this series about a week and a half ago and finished Mockingjay in one day (yesterday).  So, I haven't had time to fully digest the books, but my first impression is simply that I'm frustrated with the character development of the last book.  I kept waiting for Katniss to become more self-aware, especially with all she's been through and growing up so quickly, but it just never happened.  Even in the epilogue, 20 years later, she still doesn't seem to have the self-awareness I would've preferred, especially an awareness of why she married Peeta and chose to have children.  It just seemed like she married him because "that's what we do, we take care of each other" and she only had children because Peeta finally convinced her to have children.  Also, I don't know if it's just Collins' style to leave her readers with questions at the end of books, but I would've liked to read more about what was going on in Katniss' head when Coin brought up the idea of a Hunger Games for the children of the Capitol.  I assume she said yes to have a better chance to kill Coin, but then, why did Haymitch also agree?  Because he knew what Katniss was going to do?  It just wasn't clear.  While this series are the first fiction books I've really loved since Harry Potter (I read very little fiction), I just feel unsatisfied w/ MJ.  I think partly because I expect YA fiction to do a better job of wrapping up loose ends at the end of a series vs. adult fiction, which tends to have more of a purpose of just being thought-provoking.
