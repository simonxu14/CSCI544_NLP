Although I wouldn't call this the worst-written book ever, and I did read it to the end, this opus is best described as decidedly mediocre. The writing style itself is very impoverished, lacking any imagination, flair or originality; it's very utilitarian and straight-forward. It really reads like a movie script project written by a young teenager. The whole setting is very contrived, which would be fine if this were a device or vehicle for something more exciting, but alas, what you see is what you get here. The characters are extremely one-dimensional and uninteresting: lack of any emotional depth is the worst aspect of the writing. The only good part that I almost enjoyed (hence the two stars) is the main battle sequence, which was absorbing enough to bring me to the end of the book, but it isn't nearly enough to tempt me to read a single page of the 2nd book of the trilogy.<br /><br />I find the high rating of this book particularly depressing, especially considering that so few people still read nowadays on a regular basis. There is more substance, imagination and thought in a single paragraph of most sci-fi or fantasy novels (to say nothing about great works of literature) than in this entire novel. It is very sad that people would waste their time reading this, instead or something more mentally stimulating. ...I just browsed through a few pages of a kindle-only "self-published" work by an unknown author advertized on the amazon homepage, and those few pages have infinitely more emotional and intellectual depth than this entire book (raised my spirits, actually).
