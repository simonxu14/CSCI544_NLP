Although I enjoyed the series the third book is a little disfunctional. it could have wrapped things up much better but instead went down different rabbit holes. Not giving justice to the charactors it could have given.  Don't get me wrong I did enjoy reading it.  Actually read twice to make sure I caught any items I might have missed the first time.  Suzanne Collins did a good job of bringing me through the trails of cruelty of war as well as triumph of overcoming obstacles of suppression.  I had found myself wanting more depth to Peeta recovery.
