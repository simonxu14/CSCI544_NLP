The precept of this book is deplorable: young, hungry people killing each other for the amusement of the bored well-to-do. The book is almost sheer violence, somewhat offset by 'teen and family affection. I stuck with it to the end, but have no desire to read a next in the series. The writing is somewhat immature, like a young writer not yet having reached her best work.
