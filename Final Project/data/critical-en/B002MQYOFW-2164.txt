I will agree with A.R. Bovey's review on here. He/She is very spot on about the take away of the last book. Reading that review helped give me a different perspective, despite that I still did not like the conclusion of the Hunger Games series.<br /><br />For me personally, I felt that the last book rushed through to finish, becoming psychologically exhausting and emotionally maddening. It took me a few days to get over the heaviness and slight agitation from finishing the book. It was a different pace from the first two books and much of the soul of those books are lost on the third. The Katniss most of us fell in love with will barely resemble her at the end.<br /><br />The last section of this book is titled "Assassination". That word alone describes to me what has been done to each of our beloved characters in this book, especially Katniss, even if some remained alive in the end. I guess those are the casualties of war.<br /><br />Yes, I agree that Suzanne is a very talented writer, but I'm just not a fan of how it was rushed to such an ending.<br /><br />This is a book I would never ever read again and the thought of watching it as a movie would probably push me into a depression.
