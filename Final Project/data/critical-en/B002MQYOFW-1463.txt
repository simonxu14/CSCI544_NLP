I'm sorry to admit but this book was a big disappointment for me. The first two books were GREAT but this one lacked luster. I actually skipped ahead alot and even skipped the last couple of chapters and just read the last chapter and didn't really get much from that either. I actually heard this from a co-worker and still decided to read it. I wished I would have just stopped on book two.
