This 3rd book in such an intense and addictive series was a major disappointment for me. During the last chunk of Mockingjay, the book feels confusing and incomplete to the reader. The author changes the way she writes and situations lack explanation all the while Katniss changes her (previously very strong) character traits and becomes someone readers don't recognize. Where did the strong, courageous and loyal character go? All I can say is that when I closed the book, I felt cheated and it seems to me that the author deprived readers of explanations and expectations-- and not in a good way. Did Ms Collins go through some major life change or have a strict deadline that she had to meet, in turn rushing Mockingjay???<br /><br />I understand some readers' explanation that this book is about war and not a romance, but the previous books led the reader to believe it was both. In this book, the author created more questions than answered and focused too much on Katniss's emotional issues than finalizing the plot.<br /><br />Sigh. I hope they change the ending in the movie. But I LOVED the other two books.
