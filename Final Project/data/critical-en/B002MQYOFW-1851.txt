I must start this review by saying I am probably not the intended audience for this book.<br /><br />This book is obviously the culmination of the Hunger Games series.  The whole premise of the series is somewhat interesting and has been attempted before in Japanese and other literature.  The story in itself is not unique.  All that being said, this story is how I would a child to view war and life threatening situations.  The themes in the story are timeless, ie self sacrifice, losing loved ones, violence, war, etc.  The way they are approached are childish.  The protagonist is more concerned with hurt feelings and love interest than gory gruesome violence surrounding her.  All of the dystopian violence in this book is extreme and would drive any narrator insane.  The narrator just goes through this war like a highschool girl goes about her day with no amount of heads blowing up or zombie animal attacks bothering her too much.  This is a really immature stupid book, I can't believe I wasted my time reading this whole series.  If you want a childish and sheltered life view of atrocity, that is what you get.  It is really popular with the younger crowd because of the lack of permanence and happy endings.  Not worth reading unless you are really bored and want to look cool to your kids or sumpin.
