I loved Hunger Games and I loved Catching Fire. I was addicted and had to know what happened to all the characters, because they are awesome. That said, I was really disappointed with this book. I'll admit right off that my favorite character is Peeta, although I love Katniss, but my problem with this book is that Peeta isn't really in it. Peeta and Katniss' relationship is my favorite part of the series, it's so uncertain and has a true feel to it. I didn't need this book to have a perfectly happy ending like it sort of had, and I think that the epilogue was unnecessary, all I wanted was the strength and determination and the glimmer of hope that was in the first two books. To me, it feels like Suzanne Collins got to the end of the third book and was like "Well...guess they'll never really recover from all that!" Loads and loads of depressing with an "and they lived happily ever after, sort of, okay not really" tacked on at the end.
