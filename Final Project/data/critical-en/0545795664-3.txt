I bought this for my little Pokemon aficionado who loves to look up and read about Pokemon on a daily basis.  We have had it for about 3 weeks now and like other reviewers stated, the pages started to fall out.  My child is heartbroken.  It is similar to the POKEMON ESSENTIAL HANDBOOK which we also have  (and we have had for about a year and pages are fine) , but it has more Pokemon, etc.  So, I don't know what the issue is with this book, but really disappointed at the quality.  My child saved up money for this and is upset that is is coming apart after 3 weeks.
