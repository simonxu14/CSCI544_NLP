What happened to the author with this book? She felt completely disconnected from her characters. Hunger Games was amazing, Catching Fire was not as good, but this one was just terrible. I found myself skimming and skipping pages because nothing interesting was going on and I just wanted to know how it ended (I think there were only 40 decent pages).
