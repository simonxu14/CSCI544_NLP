I read each of these books and really enjoyed the first and second ones. In fact I couldn't put them down. This 3rd one, not so much. It was decent, and probably more realistic to the ways of war, but it was much harder to follow and too many characters wihout character development. I don't mind how it ended. I'm good with that part. I just think this book wasn't the best for the end of any series, much less this one. Like others have said, it just felt rushed.
