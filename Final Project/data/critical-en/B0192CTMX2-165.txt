Ok, so it's the 5th book, and the first chapter is MARVELOUS!  I must say, it ended with a bang and was full of suspense and action...and then the story kicked into low gear.  It's long.  And it is very much an ending to the 4th book, but I'm afraid that it carried the weight of a book that was thrown together with bits off the cutting room floor.  I get the feeling from it that the author was pre-occupied in writing this story.  I'm a huge fan, I own all four previous years in Hardback and on CD and I love them. My favorite story remains "Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban".  Unfortunately I can't give details of what made the story drag for me, not without spoiling it for you.  I would say, Buy this book if you love Harry.  It'll be needed to get into the 6th book, but don't start reading the series here.
