The book itself was great for my son. He loves being able to check out all the characters. The book was just very poorly made. Every page fell out of the book as the pages were turned. This started happening immediately after opening the book upon receipt. The book is truly being held together by scotch tape on every page. The price was good, but was definitely expecting it to be made with better quality, especially since it is a children's book and made by Scholastic.
