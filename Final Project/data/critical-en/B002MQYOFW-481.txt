Not that this was a bad book, but I just felt as if some of the story line was so rushed that you didn't get any of the emotional impact that would have been essential.  Ex. Finnick and then the Holo part (being vague to not spoil anything for others).  Then there was also the lact of detail here and there, or so I thought.  It was nice just to have a wrap up of the story, but I felt it really could have taken a more intiging direction as well as filling in a few holes in the end.<br /><br />I wantd to add. I didn't want a Happily Every After ending. I was happy with the idea of some distrust, and post tramatic stress, ect.  I just felt like the getting to ending was missing some key points.
