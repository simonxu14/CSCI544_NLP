I won't be reading any more of these books.  I like science fiction but this was a very depressing book.  If I thought that this is what the future held I would not want to continue living toward a situation like this in the USA.  But the thing I found interesting is that considering  the place where this story originates in coal mining country where poverty, illness, and not much encouragement exists maybe we are already there.
