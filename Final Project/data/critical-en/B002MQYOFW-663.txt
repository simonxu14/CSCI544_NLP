Loved the first two books but this one... where did that come from? Katniss lost all her appeal in this book -  moody, annoying, whiny, selfish. I couldn't wait for this thing to end. And far from being unpredictable, I thought the ending was contrived. If they ever make a movie of this book, some screenwriter will have to do major surgery to make it watchable.
