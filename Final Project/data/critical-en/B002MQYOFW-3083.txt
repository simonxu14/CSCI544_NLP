I hardly ever write reviews for the books I read, because I figure no matter what I say, someone else will have said it already. But I just finished reading Mockingjay, and I just can't contain myself after reading this tragic farce of an ending to a series that was so brilliantly begun.<br /><br />Hunger Games was one of the best books I read this year, hands down. My pulse was literally racing as I read it, and I couldn't do anything other than read it until I had consumed the entire thing whole.<br /><br />Catching Fire, which I read some months later, was a disappointment. I found Katniss' character flaws (selfishness, whining, total obliviousness, to name a few) to be more glaring than they were in the first, when they were overshadowed by the rip-roaring pace of the plot. I also found the love triangle plotline to be very wearisome -- hello, didn't we do that already with Jacob and Edward? Please.<br /><br />And the whole rebel plotline tried to make the success of the first book into something it was not. Hunger Games worked because it was entirely contained within the small world of the Games. By trying to take Catching Fire to a larger level and make some kind of statement about Katniss' society (and therefore our own), I felt like the author lost sight of the limited scope that made the first novel so dynamic and original.<br /><br />But the book picked up a great deal when they went back into the arena -- what can I say, perhaps I'm just a bored complacent Capitolite myself.<br /><br />Unfortunately, all of what was bad about Catching Fire was back again in Mockingjay, without any brutally creative survivalism going on in the arena. I know storming the Capitol with its pods was supposed to be similar, but it just didn't do it for me. The writing was slopping, the plotting all over the place -- I didn't even realize when main characters died, or much care -- and again, the attempt to make a larger statement about the society of Panem was very heavy-handed.<br /><br />Worst of all though was Katniss. By this point, I was so sick of her that I wished someone would just kill her off already. Gone is the dynamic, butt-kicking main character of the Hunger Games book, leaving in her place a guilt-ridden, whiny, unstable wreck dependent on the good will of those who -- for some strange reason -- continued to love her.<br /><br />Katniss seems to drift along with the tide, changing her mind about her motives and alliances every ten pages or so, never able to go in a straight line or accomplish anything with purpose. Again, she reminded me far too much of Bella from the Twilight books. I started this series being glad that Katniss Everdeen represented an alternative to the indecisive, whiny role model that Bella gives to young women, and ended it sickened by yet another strong young woman wavering between boys while real life drama goes on around her.<br /><br />My advice: save yourself and just stop reading after the first one. I wish I had.
