As much as I loved the rest of the series, I unfortunately was dissapointed in Mockingjay. I was so excited to read it (I first read it a few years ago).  I had read the first two books in the series really quickly after borrowing them from my nephew.  I ended up purchasing this for my kindle when I couldn't wait anymore for him to finish.  There were some parts that weren't bad in this book but overall I was disappointed.  I have read it several times since then even though I didn't enjoy it as much of the rest of the series, so it wasn't completely awful. I am a Hunger Games fan though so I have definitely overlooked the things I didn't like about this book.
