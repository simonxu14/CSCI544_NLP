A good solid book.  If this were the only book in the series, I might rate if differently.  However, as the ending of The Hunger Games trilogy, meh.  Don't get me wrong, it is a good trilogy and I am glad that I read them.  The series as a whole is probably 5 star.<br /><br />The problem with this book is the length.  Whenever I read the first two books, I never wished it would end.  20% of this book could have been cut out and it would have improved the story.<br /><br />First, is Katniss a rebel or capital sympathizer?  I understand that war is hell and I really get that, however, after all that she has been through I don't think she would have been so wishy-washy.  There was a point where I honestly thought, I wish this book was about Haymitch.  At least he knows he is in a war.<br /><br />I liked the game part of the first two books and thought this book would have been better if there had been some sort of "games".  I understand that it was war and that is fine.  Just another reason this book wasn't as high on my scale as the others.<br /><br />Finally, the love story.  I will get this out of the way first.  I hate twilight.  Partly because the author took vampires and, well we won't get into that. Mostly I hated the love story.  I have to say that this one is maybe even worse.  Maybe, but at least Suzanne Collins is a good author.<br /><br />--POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT--  It seemed in this book that Katniss devolved and by the end didn't really love either of the gentlemen.  It would have made more sense if she had chosen no one.  By the end she was so devestated and destroyed by the loss of her sister just let her live her life in solitary.  I would kind of liked to seen her become a female Haymitch.  Sometimes you can't recover from what you go through and at least it would have felt real.<br /><br />This one felt like she just choose the guy that ended up living close too her.  I know what your saying and I did read the sentence that explained, Peeta wasn't full of rage like Gayle but really?  Just my opinion, I personally would have liked it better if it was just more about the games and a more realistic ending.<br /><br />I really wanted to give this book 3 stars but decided that the entire series is good enough to raise the 3rd book up a little.
