My boys and I have spent many wonderful hours reading Harry Potter stories together. However, I am not reading them this one---not for a long time.<br />This book has far too much pain and suffering to be a children's story. I realize Ms. Rowling created these characters and can treat them any way she chooses, but some characters have such a complete personality change that it makes this "believable fiction" feel so truly unreal.
