I devoured the first two books of the series, but this one was so hard to get into. Other reviewers have laid out the many issues of this book, so I'll be brief as to not be repetitious. Too many new characters that only existed to be killed off, too little of the characters I loved (Peeta and Haymitch), and way too many scenes of Katniss passing out and ducking into closets/alcoves. I wasn't expected a happy ending, considering the nature of the books, but this was just downright depressing. I haven't been this bitterly disappointed in a book in a very long time.
