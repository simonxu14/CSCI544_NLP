Read the books one after the other within a few weeks. Interesting theme, fast paced in certain parts but did not keep me engaged. Lost momentum in the second book but picked it up again in the last book which was good. Not a book I would typically select but was suggested  by my daughter who loved them and we enjoyed having discussions about the themes, characters etc.
