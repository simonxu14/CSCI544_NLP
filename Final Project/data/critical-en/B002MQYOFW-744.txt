Were do i begin. I am going to try to make this short. This book was a flop. The context was confusing and vauge. I didn't understand what was going on. I'm just going to say this. The book sucked. Katniss was more meaner than ever, Peeta went nuts, and Gale left. When i read that part i looked up and said "Why?". That was just a writing mistake. Oh, and prim dying. whose ever idea that was deserved to be slapped. Hard. That made Katniss more pissed and stressed than she really was. Even though prim, in my eyes, was a drag, that was just uncalled for. And Peeta? I actually thought that was a nice touch that they hijacked Peeta. It put Katniss in her place. One last thing i think is important is this. The ending was a bad ending to an even worse book. That's all. I may be a kid, but i talk like an adult.
