The navigation is really lacking in the Trilogy Edition of this book. You can't navigate between chapters in each book, you can only jump to each part, where each book is split into (I believe) 3 parts. Also for some reason the font is at least twice as large as in the individual books.<br /><br />BUY THE BOOKS INDIVIDUALLY.<br /><br />The $2 you save by buying the 3 books as one is not worth it.
