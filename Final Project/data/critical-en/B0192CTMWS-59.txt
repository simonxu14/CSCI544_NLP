No longer can you identify with the star of the story, as he irrationally turns on his friends for following his previously revered Dumbledore's advice, and acts irrationally throughout the rest of the story as well.  The story is like a can of worms opened up all at once - a million story lines suddenly popping out at the same time, and most do not get wrapped up satisfactorily in the end, and detract from the main story line.  The main story line is lame, making "you know who" go all out and sacrifice his best deatheaters for something of very little value to his cause.  The ending is hurried, as though the author suddenly realized that 600 pages had passed and the book was nowhere near ending.  Accordingly, it is a predictable, unimpressive, unchallenging ending without any logic or "wow" appeal.  Good guy comes in, wraps it all up, people suddenly change their minds, all is right with the world again, all in a few pages at the end.  Very unsatisfying.  Throughout the book, all rules, restrictions and bets are off as to any set in previous books.  All previous personalities have radical changes and after this fiasco, Hogwarts could never return to be the haven it once was.  Ghost written?
