I got this book on Saturday (thanks to the amazon.com shipping special they had) and I finished it on sunday (thanks to me reading fast).  I finished the book, and I didn't know what to say.  I had read the 3  previous books, and was expecting a lot from this book, perhaps unfairly  so, and this book just didn't live up to what I was expecting.<br />First, I  might have an unfairly biased opinion seeing as how I am probably  &quot;outside&quot; the intended age of the readers of this book, but when  you find great literature such as Jk Rawlings has written, I don't think  there should be any age limit or bounds on who can read it.<br />Having said  that, I thought the first 3 books were magical, whimsical, and touched off  something in each of us that very few authors can do.  I think that this  4th book didn't quite capture that same feeling; it left me feeling as  though the author really pushed this book out; and struggledto meet a page  limit.<br />I wasn't exceptionally impressed, I think that the characters need  a breath of fresh air, and I think the book needs to break out of the mold  it is getting into.  The first 3 books &quot;worked&quot; very well, the  whole land and setting were new, and the concepts were new.  JK Rawlings  granted new characters and new things in each book, but I sort of think  that she needed something drastically new for this book, and she didn't do  it.<br />I got sort of tired reading this book; it needed more, alhtough it  was a lot longer than the last 3 books, I don't think it covered as much as  1 of the previous books.  I have the feeling that Rawlings was pushed to  make this book long, and that the story didn't come from her heart, but  rather from her mind.  She didn't appear to be writing to have fun; but  rather writing to meet a deadline.<br />I know the beginning of this review is  not very favorable for the book; but overall this book was a good book.  I  would definitely suggest buying it and reading it; you will still be amazed  and delighted by the scenery adn setting; the characters are teh same, and  the evil is eviller.<br />I just expected a little more from this author.
