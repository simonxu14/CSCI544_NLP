Firstly, if you have not read this first book, I will not include any spoilers in my assessment.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the Dystopian future genre i.e. Blade Runner, 1984, Logans Run, Rollerball (the one with James Caan, not the piece of garbage with LL cool J) than this should hold your attention.<br /><br />Imagine taking the reality shows Survivor and the Bachelor and put them in a gladiator arena for the amusement of the sick twisted empire.<br /><br />Our protaganist Katniss is a survivor, nothing special to look at very much just trying to figure out how to survive in an environemt were food is scarce and the totalitarian government treats you like a slave. Every year the government aka "capital" puts on a gladiatorial game called the "hunger games" in which one boy and one girl 12-18 is chosen from each of the 12 districts.<br /><br />The book primarily focuses on our protaganist and how she makes some difficult choices about what it takes to survive in the arena.<br /><br />For folks that are trying to make this like an alternative to Twilight, I scoff at you. There is very little in the first book to suggest a real love triangle.<br /><br />I am also grateful that the author Ms. Collins doesn't do that horrible JK Rowling routine of inventing a problem then inventing a spell to defeat the problem (how she convinced a bunch of kids to read the same book 7 times is beyond my comprehension). Ms Collins only uses one such device in this book and it is during a moment when our protaganist is stuck up a tree without a paddle (I wont say more so as not to violate my no spoiler promise).<br /><br />Although many of the tweens who have reviewed this book here and on youtube suggest that it is a blazing page turner; I found myself not in agreement. The action and intrigue is paced pretty evenly throughout the book; yet much of the time is spent basically camping in the wild (i.e. setting up camp, hunting for food, collecting water etc.).<br /><br />Now since it is the "hunger games" I can sort of let all of that slide a little but there are guite a few dead slow moments in the book even during the time in the arena.<br /><br />A good read and I hope the next two books go deeper into the political intrigue and how our protaganist will attempt to take down the empire from within.
