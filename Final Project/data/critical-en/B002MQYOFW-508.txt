I was very disappointed by this book. The first 2, in my opinion, we're sensational. I was expecting much more from this one. I didn't like the direction it took. From the very start Katniss seemed so disconnected and reckless. Much moreso than in the first 2 books, and almost to the point of frustration.<br /><br />--- Possible Spoiler ---<br /><br />The ending was far too sudden and very anti-climactic. It almost felt to me like it was just jumbled together at the very last minute in order to meet a deadline. I would have liked for things to go much slower and come in more detail. The relationships between Katniss and those closest to her seemed to disappear into the background, almost as if she no longer cared. I was going to give the book 2 stars, but decided on 3 only because of the way it ended (literally the last 2 pages).
