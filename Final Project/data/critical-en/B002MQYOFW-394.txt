After reading "The Hunger Games", I was hooked.  I raced through Book 2 ("Catching Fire") and was eager to read "Mockingjay"!  The book started out well, picking up where "Catching Fire" left off, with the same characters and some new ones.  Unfortunately, the characters get bogged-down in superfluous details of the rebel battles.  The ending and reunion of Katniss and Peeta  is abrupt and lacking in the descriptive prose of the first two books.  This final book left me longing for a re-write!!!
