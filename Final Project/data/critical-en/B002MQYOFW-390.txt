Other reviewers have said it, but I'll confirm the themes: the third Hunger Games novel has no depth. It creates tension and builds to crescendo time and time again - then just skips over the action with a gauzy "she spent weeks recovering in the hospital wing" throw-away. Characters that showed promise in the first two books are treated as two-dimensional cardboard stand-ups in the third. Really, nothing interesting happens. Or if it does, Collins gives it a teasing sentence or two of poor explanation. Katniss makes a bold move when she has a chance to execute President Snow - how exciting, what happens next? Oh - we fast forward several weeks and everything's resolved. Everything as in, well, NOT whatever you want to know because the author is too busy finishing the book to add any explanatory details at all.<br />This book is full of really awkward turns of phrase and lots of dangling scenarios and character development, too, if that's your cup of tea. The only way this hot mess makes sense is if you say it's confusing, meandering and full of holes because that's what war and violence do to people. Is it a clever demonstration of the effect of war on the human mind? No, that's giving it too much credit. If that connection IS there, it's accidental, not intentional, based on how poorly the story is constructed. It's just a serious of swings - and misses.
