I couldn't get myself into that hazily depicted world and shallowly constucted characters.  The world itself needs a lot deeper, fuller, & richer identity for me to be able to relate to it or its characters with any depth of interest and connection.  I recognize that it is geared to the young, but I don't think it gives the young credit for much to bring to it.
