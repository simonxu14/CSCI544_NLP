This book was a somewhat underwhelming conclusion to a series that had been exciting and interesting up to this point. No qualms with my purchase or with the book quality etc obviously, except I noticed a few more typos than usual. I would recommend it only to those who have read the first 2 and who absolutely have to know how it ends, but honestly I feel the same way as I do about the matrix trilogy, if you've seen the first one, just use your imagination to conjure up what happens next, as the premise set up at the end is let down by the actual conclusion.
