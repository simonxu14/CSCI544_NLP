Ok, so I just finished the Hunger Games trilogy. I loved the first two books in the series sooooo much. I loved Katniss, Peeta, and even Gale. They were all very strong characters and had so much potential to become so much more, especially Katniss. The plots were amazing and just kept the reader enthralled through out the two books. I found myself so drawn into the first two books that I found myself rushing home to read them;however, this was not the case with MOCKINGJAY!!! I feel like i read the wrong book and feel like I've been punk'd or something. WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED???? Did suzanne Collin's brain get  hijacked or something??? What the hell was she thinking writing this slop??? I feel so completely betrayed. The character development I read about in the first two books was nowhere to be found in MOCKINGJAY, Katniss was reduced to some weak and deranged girl and Peeta was made to be some lost little boy who didn't knowmwho he was. I actually found myself disgusted by these two and wanted to throw my iPad so many times that I lost count. I cannot believe the slop that was the ending, are you joking me?????! What a waste...m
