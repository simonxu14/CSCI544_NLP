What a complete let down.  I loved the first two books of this series and devoured them (reading both in less than a week).  The third book definitely 'jumped the shark' in my opinion.  It lost me, plain and simple.  Now I regret wasting the time reading the first two.  The storyline becomes thin, weak, and quite uninteresting.
