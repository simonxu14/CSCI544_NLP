Here's a suggestion: if you like young adult dystopian novels, read&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Giver/dp/0385732554/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Giver</a>.  And another: If you like science fiction revolt novels, read&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Moon-Is-a-Harsh-Mistress/dp/0312863551/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</a>.  Heck, I'll give you another: if you like youth in revolt novels, read&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Johnny-Tremain/dp/0440442508/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Johnny Tremain</a>.  Ignore the hype, this series is not worth your time.<br /><br />I read all three books in the month after the release of, and the associated hype involved of Mockingjay.  I don't know where the hype came from.  Collins writes with a subdued color-scheme and nothing pops off the page.  For me, the characters were too flat.  This leads to unbelievable relationships or at the very least relationships where there seems to be nothing at stake; a problem when your tale centers on a love triangle.  The only relationship with any sense of truth is that of Katniss and her sister, and that stays in the background as a tertiary relationship until the end.<br /><br />It's not just the characters that are flat.  I had to reconceptionalize what was bugging me during the long exposition periods of the first two books and I think I figured it out.  Her setting is flat.  Collins seems not to fully have done her homework on economics, politics, or science.  I just never believe the world she builds and that pollutes the story she tries to impose on top of this foundation.<br /><br />If Collins' weakness is in characterization and setting, her strength is in writing action.  This book, as the others, move along well once Katniss and her team are shooting something or killing things.  Mockingjay hits that point sooner than the others, so in a manner this is the best of the series.  However, there are a couple of twists at the end that feel slightly telegraphed and partly clich&eacute;d.  These are poorly done and either are meant to give the reader credit for their cleverness in knowing what is going to happen or to surprise them with a twist.  I'm not sure, but I think it represents the feelings I have about the series as a whole: There's the seed of a good idea, but overall it is poorly executed.
