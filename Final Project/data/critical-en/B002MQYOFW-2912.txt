I read the first two so I had to read this one -- more of the same.  Its probably great for another age group -- I'm 45-50, minivan Mom so its just not my thing.  But I will finish it to see what happens!  I wish Gale had a bigger part in the series.<br /><br />This book, BTW, is not for preadolesence (its for 13 and over).  (Did I spell that right?!)
