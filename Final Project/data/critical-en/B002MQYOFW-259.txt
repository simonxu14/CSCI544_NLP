I was rather disappointed with this book, having read the first two in the trilogy and loving both of them. It was almost like the author grew tired of the storyline and just wanted to end the series without much thought. In my opinion, had the author embellished this book more she could have easily created another volume to the story. Otherwise, overall the series is very entertaining.
