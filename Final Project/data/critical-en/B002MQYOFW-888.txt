I thought this was a good but sad ending to a brilliant series... You must read it if you have read the first two though. Otherwise you're left on a cliff hanger. Like I said, this book was sad. All the characters presented differently to how they were in the last books. Peeta's absence from the book did nothing to help matters. Some of the romance feel that attracted quite a few teenaged girls to the series backed off in... not disgust... just a feeling of disappointment to how it ends up for everyone. Don't let my review put you off. The ending works, no matter how different. I don't think Suzanne Collins could have done it much better.<br />Warning spoilers!!!!<br />I felt deeply betrayed when it ended on such a sad note... The one downside to the epic finale. Katniss's family half dead and Gale pretty much gone from her life. There wasn't enough of Peeta and Katniss to keep be going.<br />And how could Suzanne Collins kill Prim? It was like Rue all over again but sadder wth no flowers or singing.
