May contain spoiler!!!<br /><br />I ordered the kindle edition. The series just went down hill. The only reason I kept reading is just to get the satisfaction of knowing what happened in the end. The book turned into politics.<br />My favorite character died which is irrelevant but it was the most entertaining part for me. Other than that don't care for it .
