Goblet of Fire is the last of the well-written Potters... barely.  J.K. Rowlings is an adequate author, but starting with Goblet, her writing became more and more verbose.  The Potter series are brilliant stories poorly told.  After the vast success of the first three books, I suspect that no editor dared to actually edit Ms. Rowlings. Hence, the books got longer... if it could be said in one sentence, Ms. Rowlings invariably used ten.  In addition, there is apparently no adverb not beloved (and overused) by this author.  After loyally buying and reading the Potter books to my kids, I gave up after this one.  The writing had just deteriorated too much.  But we wanted to know what happened to Harry, so we saw the movies.  It's a sad, sad day when the movie is better than the book!  My advice is to enjoy the first three books; then get the movies for the rest. -- Felicia Rose Levitt, author of "The Road to Aradell: A Sexy, Complicated Love Story."
