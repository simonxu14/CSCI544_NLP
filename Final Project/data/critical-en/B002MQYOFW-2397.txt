Given the depth of the first two books, this was a disappointing read. It lacked the character development, the meaningful interactions and mostly the opportunity to relate and bond with key characters. The ending was typical and expected when the first two books where full of the unexpected and thoughtful. The author/editors appeared to lose their focus in the finally. I would have been happy to wait another year and finished with a book worthy of the first two....
