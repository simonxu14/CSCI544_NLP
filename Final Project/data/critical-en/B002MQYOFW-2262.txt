I as an adult read these books because I heard my son's elementary school teacher was reading to him allowed on a daily basis. My family rented the movie, so there were parents, grandparents, uncles and my impressiable son. Well, we were mortified with the violence, as if our youth needs any more ideas than what they see on video games. My son's school teacher gave him the second copy to the series. I am completely disappointed.
