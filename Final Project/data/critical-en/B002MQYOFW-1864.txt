The first book<br />After the dark days ,the capitol decides to start the hunger games to remind the people of the districts (12 in all) that they are above them .<br />The hunger games involve 24 kids (1 boy,1 girl) from all the districts .<br /> Kat is a girl from district 12 or the coal mines and is the tribute from this district who has an advantage because she hunts to keep her family alive.The other tribute is peeta.<br />Peeta pulls a stunt to keep himself and kat alive and kat goes along with it to survive but only towards the end she gets to know that the stunt is reality but by then the damage is already done<br />The ending of this book is quite surprising but well thought and is is also the beginning of the uprising .<br /><br />Book 3<br />This book is personally a very depressing book<br />Kat has a breakdown twice<br />The first when she gets to know about preetas whereabouts and the second is towards the end when she loses a lot of things close to her heart<br />She realises the cost of being the mockingbird<br />But the only thing in the book the book that was disappointing was the end<br />Personally it was not apt<br />Warning : certain parts in the third book might get you depressed
