It's a fun read and certainly a page turner. But that's mostly it. I enjoyed reading it, couldn't put it down, and finished it in under a day; however, when I did finish it I wasn't satisfied as the book (and characters) felt hollow. This is perhaps a result of two factors: 1) the book comes highly recommended by nearly everyone, and more importantly 2) I had no idea it was a teen fiction book until after I finished it. Considering it's teen fiction, I suppose the fact that there were far too many implied points that were unnecessarily mentioned by the narrator (or the narrator says points in a way that tries to make it sound insightful to the reader, which they were not) and too many words were italicized for effect are justified (but they were frequently annoying while reading).<br /><br />Due to its entertainment value, I'll give it a solid 3 stars and recommend it to people who are looking for a quick, easy read  - perhaps a book you'd take to the beach (though my recommendation so far to people I've spoken with about the book is that they're probably better off just waiting for the movie to come out). But if you're looking for something insightful and thought provoking, I'd look elsewhere.
