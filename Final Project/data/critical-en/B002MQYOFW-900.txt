The book came on time, and in great condition. This is all the good I can say about the Hunger Games. While reading the book I felt as though the book plot had been ripped off from something I've read before (I wish I remembered what the name of the book was). If you want to read a new series, and a great one I might add then try &#34;Rangers Apprentice&#34;.
