I found out about these books before the movies came out so I rushed to read them before seeing the movie.  I liked the first one and the second one was decent.  The last one was a large letdown.  Rather than taking this in a positive direction and having the character triumph over the adversity, she instead seems weak and completely broken.  It would have been nice to have some ray of hope in the end.  I'd also liked it if there was actually a good side to root for.  It seemed quite a depressing way to end what was a great start to a trilogy.
