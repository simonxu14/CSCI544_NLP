I really liked book one and two in the series.  This book was a little bit disappointing, though.  I feel like the author lost touch with who Katniss is.  I didn't even really like her in this book.  Also, so many people die in the book, and it all seems so pointless.  I'm sure that the author was trying to make some kind of statement about war, but it all left me feeling very sad and disappointed.  I almost didn't even want to finish the book.
