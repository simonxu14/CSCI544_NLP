Perhaps having read 'Battle Royale' by Koushun Takami before reading the Hunger Games somewhat ruined the novelty of the storyline. For those unfamiliar with it, Battle Royale was a Japanese cult classic (that eventually gained mainstream recognition) with the following premise;<br /><br />The totalitarian nation of Japan has collapsed. At fifteen percent unemployment, ten million were out of work. 800,000 students boycotted school. The adults lost confidence and, fearing the youth, eventually passed the Battle Royale act. Every year, a high school class (42 students) is selected at random by the government and taken to a secure location, where they are forced to kill one another until a single victor emerges. It is meant to quell rebellion and create fear in the general populace.<br /><br />Somehow, Koushun Takami makes me care more about over twenty individual characters than I cared about Katniss Everdeen. The premise of Collins' novel is hardly original and she does not add any truly unique aspects to her story that capture my attention. I've already read to death the whole 'utopia ruling over the distopia' cliche... I was also unable to relate on an emotional level the trials Katniss faced. If the whole book was supported by the awful reality of forcing children to kill one another... that requires the reader to care not only for the main character, but the victims as well. In a melee that supposedly contains 24 children, Collins decides early not to focus on more than three of them, two of them being the main characters. As this is a young adult book and the first of a trilogy, that detracts heavily from the suspense that otherwise might have been garnered over the fate of the main character.<br /><br />It is in this fashion that Battle Royale shines and The Hunger Games falters. I felt nothing at all while reading The Hunger Games as young children were murdered one by one without the reader learning so much as their name, let alone any sort of back story. Katniss could very well be prancing through the prairie cutting the heads off of dandelions for all I care. There is exactly one character that creates emotional impact, other than the main two characters.<br /><br />The book is rather short, and the wording simplistic. I have read my fair share of young adult novels, and Collins is not that impressive in her prose. Also, and call me nitpicky, but I didn't read any sort of review or book summary before reading this book - therefore, I spent a large portion of the beginning of the book unclear on the gender of the main character. There is also no mention made of her looks. From what I can gather, she is white and has long hair. That's it. I could not tell you what color her hair is, what color her eyes are, how tall or short she is. I like to be able to hold a picture in my head of the people and places I am reading. Collins assigns very few physical attributes to her characters, and having finished the book I cannot describe to you what the Capitol looks like, or what her District looks like, or what Katniss' home looks like. No great effort is made by the author to develop her characters and settings into things you can see. I find this incredibly frustrating.<br /><br />I will not be reading the rest of the series.<br /><br />In all, I'd recommend someone read Battle Royale over reading this.
