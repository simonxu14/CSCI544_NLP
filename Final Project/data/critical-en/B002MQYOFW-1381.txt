I LOVED Hunger Games, and was still hanging on for Catching Fire, but I actually almost gave this book 1 star! It was so bad! The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is that the series ended. Often, authors intend to write a trilogy and it turns into a sprawling mess, so I have to applaud Ms. Collins' ability to actually end the series. But, it was too tragic!<br /><br />I don't like to have spoilers, so I won't comment on what was tragic, but overall, I felt like I had been bludgeoned to death by one tragic event after another. In addition, I figured that Katniss would eventually flesh out as a likable, or at least believable, character. I was wrong. The resolution of the Peeta/Gale thing was pretty weak as well.<br /><br />I am usually obsessed with having every book in series that I've read, but I actually sold Mockingjay to a second-hand book store. I would recommend reading the first two books and then just creating your own adventure for the end. Don't put yourself through this book.
