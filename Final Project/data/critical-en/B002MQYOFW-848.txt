This book is just going through the motions, as Collins finishes out her story.  While attempting a much more epic scope than the preceding books in the series, Mockingjay falls flat.  The strength of The Hunger Games and, to a lesser degree, Catching Fire, was their emphasis on a very personal ordeal.  Mockingjay tries to graft Katniss's story onto the wider war, but the result is disjointed and rather uninspiring.  It mainly comes across as the entire world operating either to help or, more commonly, to threaten, Katniss personally.  A disappointment.
