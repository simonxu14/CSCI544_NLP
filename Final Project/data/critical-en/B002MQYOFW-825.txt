While I devoured &#34;Catching Fire&#34; I am having a hard time finishing this book. I like Katniss' character, for the most part, but the self-doubt and blaming theme is getting old. I need something to happen, already.<br /> I don't understand her anger with what's-his-face, her coach. And of course she should know that Peeta is just playing games (no pun intended) with the Capitol: Tell them what they want to hear and continue with your own agenda. I do like that District 13 is not portrayed as a Utopia, rather true to human nature with the same power plays and manipulations, just on the &#34;right side&#34; of the conflict.<br />I think I will have to power through it and see if it &#34;gets good.&#34;  I would still recommend reading it. I mean, come on, are you really going to stop in the middle of a trilogy? My one hope is that Katniss does stop her self-pitying and self-righteous b-ing and moaning by the end of the tale and allows herself to feel happy sometimes. Gawd!
