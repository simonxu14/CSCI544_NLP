I am a thirteen year old girl, and I thought that this book was okay. Katniss is really a strong character. It is easy to see throughout the entire novel what see wants-to protect Prim, her little sister. This is what drives Katniss's actions throughout the entire series. See is entered into the Hunger Games because of her urge to protect Prim from harm. I was disappointed in Peeta's character, however. I found it hard to see his motives in the Games. He was unreadable, which doesn't correspond with his character, who seems to Katniss to be open to her. The plot was good, though I found it a bit gruesome. Overall, this book was fine.
