Great book for the Pokemon fan.  I'd give this book a 5 star had the quality of the actual book been better.  The pages tend to fall out easily.  The actual content is s 5 but quality of the book is a 2!  My son loves it but I don't enjoy taping the pages back on.  The binding of this book needs improvement!!!
