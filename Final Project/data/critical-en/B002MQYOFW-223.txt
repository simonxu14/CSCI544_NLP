**Spoilers in this review.<br /><br /> The hunger games was ok, but even that was pretty darn sadistic.  The problem with all 3 books is sadism.  In the second book, big surprise, back in the arena for our little girl to get tortured some more.  Third book, full scale war, but not many details.  More of the same little girl who can't seem to reason at all and I don't care all that much about, whom everyone loves and has 2 guys after her all the time. No sense of humor by the author.  No characters seem to change or grow.  Peeta changes, sorta,<br />but is mostly helpless and doesn't do much.<br />  Kids killing each other for sport?  Even the Roman's had better sense than this. Is the author trying to 'one up' Hollywood here?<br />  The main point of this series seems to be to show how terrible war and suffering is, yet that is really the main selling point.  The whole Hunger Games trilogy is really a Gladiator type of story brought to horrific proportions and not letting up. Almost no philosophy or reasoning ABOUT war and torture.  It's no wonder its becoming a movie now, since people really love sadism more than anything else, especially in the U.S.  A main plot point is that the whole gruesome thing is televised and turned into a sport.<br />  Just doesn't seem plausible at all. Yea you had the Arena in Rome, but you had a good chance of living in a fight there, and Gladiators were not children picked at random to fight until only one lives, and then later picking up that winning child and saying, oh your going in again, good luck.<br />  The main character Katniss did not really grow up, she never seemed to understand war, even at the end when she does silly things like trying to go after the big bad guy on her own.  Really?  That's like running into Nazi Germany going after Hitler with some friends of yours with cameras and a few weapons!<br />  Fashion and blood?  Oddly enough, fashion seems to be very important to the author.  Of course the young girl, like in so many stories these days, has 2 guys to choose from and is the center of everyone's attention, and looks fabulous with her hair designers and dress makers, just before going in to kill people.  No humor at all in these stories, by the way.  If the fashion thing sounds funny, its really just bizarre and out of place in the books.<br />  The war at the end was illogical.  A couple of times in the book we are reminded how the Capitol relies on the districts for resources such as food.  Later  the districts have won their freedom and cut off supplies to the capitol. The painfully obvious course of action is to wait and starve them in to surrender, or just ignore them cautiously while you rebuild.  Instead, the rebels push forward into  traps that kill hundreds of people, and a few main characters to get to the big bad guy.<br />  The Good:  The final ending was a little bit of a surprise, with the Rebel President doing something evil.  All the books read fast and there is a lot of action.  You develop sympathy for a lot of the characters, although I didn't relate to any of them.  The settings are good, a contrast of the rich capitol with the starving districts.<br />  I wonder if the Capitol could be seen as the USA, a spoiled rich government dependent on other countries while caring little for others lives outside its own borders?
