There is really nothing I can say that hasn't already been said countless times by other reviewers. This book was terrible. Collins really fumbled this one. I could hardly put down the first two books but Mockingjay was tough to get through. Collins must have little respect for her readers, as all the "good" scenes were told to us secondhand by Haymitch in one sentence. So this book was basically Katniss sniveling and being depressed somewhere, and then someone will come in and say something important happened but we, the audience, don't get to be there because we are tethered to an empty shell of a narrator who has absolutely no conviction. Her treatment of poor Peeta really just made me dislike Katniss completely. Don't even get me started on that horrible epilogue. Blah.
