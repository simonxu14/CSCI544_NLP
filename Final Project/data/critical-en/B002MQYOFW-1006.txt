Nothing really jumped out and excited me as was the case in the first two books. Katniss just did the same old (by now) stuff and one minute she was threatening Haymitch, the next (when he threatened her with the headpiece instead of the earpiece) she was cowing down to him. Finnick was disposed of much too quickly. After all the buildup, Phoof, he was gone. Oh well, all in all, I enjoyed the series and wish there were more of this type books on the market. &#34;I Am Number Four&#34; is a good one that comes to mind.
