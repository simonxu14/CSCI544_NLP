** SPOILERS in this review **<br /><br />Ok....As the reader, I came into this book with certain expectations. I expected war. I expected a sigificant death toll. I expected less of the love triangle aspect, however I knew it would be integrated and eventually resolved. I cared about these characters, who Collins did a beautiful job with in the first two books, and I expected them to be written in the same light. If they had to die it would be with cause and it would be emotional.<br /><br />War and death toll I got. The rest, not so much.<br /><br />Finnick's and Prim's deaths seem so casual, like "Oh well, Finnick was too slow so the mutts got him. Anyways, moving on!" - Obviously that's not a literal translation, but that's how I took it. It was so emotionless... Not like when Rue dies in the second book, there I really felt something... Even Prim, who was the original catalyst for Katniss to ever volunteer as Tribute in the first place, who Katniss cared for more than anything in the world, dies in an explosion and then we go right to Katniss being in the hospital morphed out on pain meds (which is just another annoying reoccurence in this book) Prim's death is so significant, yet is written so abruptly. This really bothers me.<br /><br />As the character who's eyes we experience this story through, Katniss has two primary objectives leading into this book. Save Peeta. Kill Snow.<br /><br />SHE ACCOMPLISHES NEITHER on a personal level. This also bothers me tremendously.<br /><br />First of all, Katniss should have been a part of Peeta's rescue mission, period. Katniss is a fighter, especially when motivated by something meaningful to her. Instead she was in a bunker with Finnick, tying knots, waiting to hear about it from some one else. This happens a lot throughout the book. Katniss not really doing much, spending a lot of time in the hospital, or unconcious, and then hearing about how things happened after. This is not in character for her. Then she votes to hold a Hunger Games of the Capitol Leader's children???? She would never have done that. It was frustrating to read that.<br /><br />The resolution with the love story is written in a sloppy and rushed manner. Gale takes a "Fancy" job in 2 and Peeta comes back to 12 where he and Katniss grow closer again. Gale, fancy? Huh???? I don't get it. I half expected one of the boys to die with a heroic passion to save Katniss, knowing the other would be there to continue to care for her.... something dramatic... not this. Katniss disconnects with Gale based on the possibility that his bomb design may have killed Prim, which HE doesn't even know. How doesn't he know if he helped to design a bomb that looked like the parachutes in the Games?? Thus leaving Katniss with Peeta by chance, not by choice. And that's it....? Oh, and Haymitch. So he moves back to 12 with her by order, and then they just don't talk anymore? Even when Peeta returns? Why?<br /><br />If I had written this review immediately after finishing the book, I would have given it one star. I was not happy. But having some time to reflect, I feel like it's necessary to read in order to complete the trilogy. Yes, I am disappointed in the hastily developed details, but the story does provide closure on most things. Maybe not the way I wanted them to, but when has war ever provided a structured or satisfying outcome? If anything, I ended up caring about Peeta more than anyone else in the story, so for him to end up with Katniss to go on with life together and have children was a definite huge positive for me... the lingering PTSD symptoms they carry are a realistic detail. And while there were many moments where I felt like Katniss wasn't written in character, she also displayed that unpredictability we know her for on so many occasions. Like when she kills Coin. That had to happen I suppose, in the bigger scheme. Snow was sentenced and was going to be executed regardless. Katniss decided to off Coin because she knew that Coin was just as corrupt, and the viscious cycle would continue in Panem with Coin in control. So I was half satisfied, but more half empty.<br /><br />I just hope that when the movie for this book is ready for production, and the story isn't portrayed strictly through Katniss's eyes, that we will finally see the things we missed - Peeta's rescue, the rebels overthrow the Capitol and Snow, maybe even Snow's trial or Katniss's trial.... I sincerely hope that Collins will help them shed light on these things, and also bring some drama and emotion with the deaths of Prim and Finnick. She owes her readers that much.
