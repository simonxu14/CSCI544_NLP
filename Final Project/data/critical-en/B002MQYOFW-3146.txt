Unlikeable lead character.  Cornball plot disguised as apocalyptic catharsis; and a lack of God or faith that, for a mainstream release, has a decidedly atheist mentality.<br /><br />First book?  Characters you never get to know dying = no weight.  Don't care.  The first person narrative was the wrong choice for a series about the exploitive death of children.<br /><br />Second book?  Jumping the shark already.  How?  SPOILER: Back in the game again.  Why didn't she have Peeta and Kat mentor?  Could have followed the same plot line, had two new characters that would surely be more likeable than Katniss, and would have made much more sense.<br /><br />Third book?  Everything falls apart.  A major surprise death at the end (again, SPOILER her sister, a character we do not know).  Seriously?  Lizard men as defense?  Hunger games methodology protecting the Bad Guy Boss?  What is the inspiration for Mockingjay, Legend of Zelda?  Video games are better these days.<br /><br />Point?  If you're looking for Harry Potter Volume 2, look elsewhere.  If you want the source material she ripped off, go to BATTLE ROYALE.  The book is a great translation, the manga is stellar.  There's more emotion in the Battle Royale comic than in this entire trilogy.<br /><br />I love soccer moms, but I do not love soccer mom HYPE.  This is all soccer mom hype.  It is not literature.
