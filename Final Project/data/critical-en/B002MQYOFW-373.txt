...I was hoping for something redemptive from the last of the trilogy .  I could not get past the whole man['s inhumanity to man  ... an idea of a society being reduced to such levels of greed, control, and the ultimate devastating loss (which if we admit it, is not far from reality).  Having to be threatened with the possibility of your child having to fight to the death for his/her life deeply troubled me.  My generation has lived through wars, assassinations, and senseless en masse violence.  While well-written and imaginative (it was as if this book was written from the perspective of someone well-experienced in violent video games...), the idea that we as a people, even in this country, could eventually realize such a state is grievous.  I wish I hadn't read it...
