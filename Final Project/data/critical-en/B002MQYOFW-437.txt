I have just finished the hunger games trilogy. The review title indicates that my enjoyment went down as I went from Book 1 to Book 3. The only reason I finished Mockingjay was to get some closure, but it was a battle. The first book was enjoyable, but I felt that book 3 was rushed by the author and I didn't really li,ke the ending. No spoiler alert, I just didn't like it.
