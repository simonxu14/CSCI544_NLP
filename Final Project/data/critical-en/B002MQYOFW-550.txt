I fully understand what Suzanne Collins was trying to communicate... however for me it was a little jaded.  And I'm not someone who needs a fairytale ending either - some of the tragic things that happened - I actually could appreciate.  It seemed like the writer has lost faith in America...when sometimes I wonder who pays who to say what... and who is really corrupted.  But that depends on if the political platform I saw in this book was real or imagined.... :)  Other than that big beef I had with it - some minor &#34;cosmetic&#34; complaints.  Katniss acted vastly out of character for me that the tragedies of war did not merit.  And justice was not done to Katniss's friendship with Gale either.  But the Coin plot twist (assuming she didn't represent someone in real life) was spot on because that lady based on her personality presented in the book alone...was a villain.  Basically the whole thing was not quite what I expected.  My best friend however thought it was great so don't take my word for it!  :)  To it's credit the whole series is a great way to debate the world and it's injustices. I think everyone has a different viewpoint on this one.  Some like it, some don't.  And I think it has a lot to do with whether you agree with Suzanne's political bend...unless you couldn't find it.  :)
