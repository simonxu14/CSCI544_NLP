Great concept, fast paced action, page turner. But in the end it was just OK for me. Where was the spiritual/moral dimension of the character development? For example, WHY did characters do what they did, for good or evil? Surely there wuld still be a few folks who believed in God after all that had happened.  I read the reviews of books 2 and 3 in the trilogy. I probably won't read them. Many thanks to those who included spoilers so I know how the story turns out without having to buy and read the other two books.
