I love the hunger games series but the last one was pretty disappointing. It started off well enough but went down hill towards the beginning of the war. The characters seemed less interesting and even disconnected with many major plot elements simply rushed or glossed over. It's like the story was written too quickly. A disappointing ending to a great series.
