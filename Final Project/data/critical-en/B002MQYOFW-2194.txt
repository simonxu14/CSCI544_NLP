I give this a "B." I truly loved and enjoyed The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. They are amazing books, but to be honest, this one fell a little flat. I dont leave a lot of reviews but I felt I needed to this time.<br /><br />I get it, we all get it, the book is about the Games. But I also thought it was really about Katniss and her survivability throughout the Games. And of course, with Katniss, comes Peeta. If Mockingjay wasnt going to be about the two of them as much as it was in the first two books, then why not let one or the other die in one of the first two books? Katniss's wavering over her feelings for Peeta have always felt like a true, genuine struggle for her. But in the third book, she cries and blacks out and vows to kill in the name of Peeta, then he shows up and she pratically dismisses him and could care less. Even after all they went through, she was ready to write him off when his condition wasnt his fault. This detail of the story really threw things off for me.<br /><br />Like another reviewer said- we get it, its about war and trauma and surviving. But we spent 2 books getting to know Katniss as the ultimate suvivor, and she spends most of the third book drugged beyond conprehension(again, mostly over Peeta) or freaking out and hiding in closets. This "broken" Katniss is treated like a Pheonix, shes strong-she falls apart-repeat.<br /><br />*spoiler*<br />I, agreeing with other reviewers, dont understand the need to kill off Prim or Finnick. Finnick, like Katniss, is a survivor. And yet he too is a weeping mess almost all of the book. I DONT GET IT. Then he dies. Just like that. Like he was some nobody-important-character. Then there is Prims death- I guess using it to divide her from Gale would be one way to do it. But it seemed cruel and needless and removed the reason Katniss even joined the games to begin with. As for the end, it felt...well...it kinda left me feeling empty. Like I went through all of this and ended up with nothing. You get to see that Peeta and Katniss end up together, but the love and the unity is totally missing, and thats a shame. They are two very beautiful characters and their story just ends in this awkward, bland, and wanting way.<br /><br />I loved this series for the most part, and I really hope the movie turns out awesome and not some D-lister. But I have to admit this last book disappointed, eventhough it was good.
