Overall a very poorly written conclusion to a promising trilogy.  It almost seemed as though this book was written by a completely different author!  There was very little character continuity or themes carried over from the previous two books in the series.  I loved the first two books, but honestly wish I had never read this one - it ruined the entire series for me.<br /><br />Things that bothered me about this book (no spoilers):<br />*The character personalities have completely changed.  There is little reason to believe that the events of this book would be any more traumatic than those in the previous volumes to merit such complete changes.<br />*Little to no conclusion on either the personal or societal aspects to the trilogy.<br />*Long passages on inconsequential characters or events, which fail to move the plot forward or serve any purpose.  They just seem like they are there because the author needed to reach a certain word limit.<br />*Poor writing that leaves you confused about what is happening.  This never happened in the previous books.<br />*Unrealistic responses to trauma and death.  When people die (especially in YA books), loved ones mourn.  I understand that in times of war you become numb to death.  But this book took that a little far, in which mourning apparently doesn't exist.<br /><br />I only gave this book 2 stars on behalf of the excellent predecessors in this series.  If you loved the first two books, do yourself a favor, and stay far away from this one.
