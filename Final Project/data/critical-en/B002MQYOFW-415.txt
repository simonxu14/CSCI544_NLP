The first book in this trilogy was by far the strongest and unfortunately, for such a strong platform, cracks readily appeared in the 2nd installment. Mockingjay, the last book, faired worse. Finishing on a weak note, the book ws definitely not as good as the first...unfortunately can't give this one a strong review - nevertheless, those on the path will have to finish it somehow, so enjoy it for what it is and don't be too disappointed.
