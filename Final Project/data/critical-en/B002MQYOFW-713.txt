This was an interesting experience, as I enjoyed the first two books at the outset of my reading of the third. As I read through the book the lack of depth in the characters became apparent. Katniss rarely is challenged in a thoughtful way and generally elects the very emotional rudimentary decisions. When she does to against the grain there is little insight into why decisions have been made this way. The degree to which this is the case only served to reveal the pattern that had been established in the first two books,<br /><br />It was quite difficult to slog through this installment, though it does pickup towards the end when an action packed plot takes over, allowing the author to settle back into her strengths. The ending isn't particularly inspiring, and the epilogue seems entirely unnecessary. If you have read the first two, and are on the fence in terms of completing the series, I recommend that you abstain and take on a new adventure.
