I should have seen this coming. I hate reality shows like "Survivor" and I knew from the movie previews that this book would be something like that. Yes, its basically "Survivor" set in the future except that the contestants are not merely voted off, they are killed off and the last survivor wins. The main character is an expert game hunter but we are deprived of any real hunting knowledge as there is absolutely no detail given. We just read that traps are set and rabbits are caught to give one typical example.
