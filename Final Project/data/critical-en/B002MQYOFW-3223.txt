I wasn't disappointed, per se, but I wasn't enthralled either.  There was nothing about this book that grabbed me and wouldn't let go.  Often, I was flat out bored, and sometime about the mid-point of the story, Collins started writing random fragment sentences.  They were so jarring to me.<br /><br />No idea if this is a spoiler or not, but I am proceeding with extreme caution:<br /><br />The Hunger Games, without the games?  Just not the same.  I knew there was no possibility of games, but I didn't realize how much it would change the dynamic of the story and virtually remove all the excitement from it.<br /><br />Bella, I mean, Katniss wasn't really herself.  And how many near-death-experiences was that?  She spent most of the book in the hospital.<br /><br />Speaking of death, Collins hasn't been shy about killing off characters, but this seemed like overkill (ha!).  And GRAPHIC.  Holy cow!  Extremely violent.  Unnecessarily so.<br /><br />End what probably wasn't at all a spoiler<br /><br />So, I don't know.  It sounds like I disliked the book, and I didn't.  But it holds none of the allure of the first two, and I personally didn't find it a particularly satisfying ending to what was a great series.  I know that the final outcome was, in a sense, pre-determined, but I think there could have been a better way to get there.  Collins got a little wrapped up in finding creative ways for people to die.  For the age group this is intended for, I found it too much, too harsh and frankly, too sad.
