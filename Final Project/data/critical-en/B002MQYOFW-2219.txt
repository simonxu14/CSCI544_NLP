This is a fast read even for young readers. The story is similar to many sci-fi stories from the early 1950s - a post apocalyptic society emerges. In this story that society might be worse than the prior one. The theme of his story does not really hold up to scrutiny. There are too many things wrong with the premise and it annoys you that they are not addressed.<br /><br />The writing itself is not all that bad. The author makes the story skip along.but it quickly become apparent what the ending will be.<br />I am not driven to read the second volume.
