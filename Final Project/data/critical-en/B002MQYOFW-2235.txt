This is really well written, but unbelievable. NO one kills kids. Paedophiles are destroyed in jail. Also people are starving? Not even via overpopulation, just because? On this fertile planet?<br /><br />The other thing I didn't like about it was the graphic violence. Why? I mean, is this really a kids series? Because it certainly gave me nightmares. This book is supposed to be for YA. Really? What is it about the world today where kids are recommended to read explicit violence, but not a swear word or the naked body? Sex and swear words no - detailed violence that makes you want to throw up for 12 year olds? Sure!
