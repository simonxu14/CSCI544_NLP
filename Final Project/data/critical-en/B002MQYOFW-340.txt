The pacing of this book was just off.  The descriptions of actions seemed more suited to instructions in a script rather than something for me to visualize as I was reading.  The intensity of the other books was lacking because days and weeks could pass in a sentence with little notice.  Sigh.  I was a latecomer to the trilogy anyway because I had started the first book twice and hadn't been caught up.  When I understood that it was a teen novel, I was able to overlook the writing style and get into the story.  If this had been the first book, I never would have read the others.
