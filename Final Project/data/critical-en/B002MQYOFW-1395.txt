This seemed interesting at first, but when I realized that adults were orchestrating a game which killed children, and they killed each other, I didn't finish reading it, saw the movie with someone who was curious, and couldn't believe it got such rave reviews by adults -<br />The plot is sick!  Unless you like the idea of children killing children.
