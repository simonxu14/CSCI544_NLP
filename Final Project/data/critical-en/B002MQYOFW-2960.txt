I thought this series went down hill after the first, excellent Hunger Games. It gets darker and darker (the Hunger Games was dark enough but had a redeeming "catharsis"). By the end of the final book, I felt no redemption; no way of feeling anything but depressed. The author's vision of human nature in this final work is dismal Well, to be fair, it is pretty dismal all the way through, it is just that I found no way to feel as if I had learned something or was in any way enlighten by the end. I find this is  very difficult, in fact, impossible, to recommend this book though I recommend the Hunger Games very positively (but with a caution).
