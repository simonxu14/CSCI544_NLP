I must admit after reading the end of this book it became  increasingly more dark and depressing. Although I was a little dissapointed with the ending (I saddly expect a perfect fairy tale ending) I don't know what I could have expected. The entire series is based on a game.where children are thrown into an arena to fight till death what did we expect butterflys and rainbows? On the.otherhand I wish so many characters had not died off and so.quickly and that katniss could have redeemed her self instead of ending as a psychologically damaged weak character because only the insane would not have recognized the simmilarities of snow and coin. Wish the relationship between her and peeta could have been.built back up before dumping us on.the curb and.driving.off.but.i guess thid is the brutal truth of war...?
