I read the first two books of this trilogy (I am an adult, 40-something years old) several months ago and am still horrified by the plot/premise of this trilogy.  The only reason I finished the two is to find out how the heroine/hero fared in their horrible world of despicable laws made by all the adults.  The events are horrific, these kids fighting - literally - to the death so that they can live.  It does portray quite well how a socialistic society works, which is good for our youth to see (as the are no longer exposed to our history found in the events during and leading up to WWII).  I think we are doing a disservice to our youth and their future by mass-marketing and pushing books of this type on younger and younger children.  Once read, these thoughts cannot be "erased" from someone's mind and imagination.  My advice :  read it before your kids do - then decide if you want to fill your offsprings' minds with these horrific images and ideas.<br />I read the online reviews of the last of the trilogy, and was dismayed by the ending, as it was not happy (actually, nothing in these books is happy).  I threw them away (not even in the recycle bin - they weren't worthy of that!)
