It's okay. The protagonist may be appealing to tween girls, but many of the rest of us will find her (and the other paper-thin characters) to be somewhat annoying. The plot is vaguely interesting.<br /><br />All in all I expect the movie may be better than the book, since 2 hours will compress this fluff down into a possibly-entertaining visual experience.
