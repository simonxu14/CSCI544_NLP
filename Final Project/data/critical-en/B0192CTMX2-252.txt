For a writer who started out so well, with so much imagination, this book felt like the author's fan's influenced her genius. She built certain characters up in the early part of her series, only to destroy and weaken them. I believe the series sunk after the "Order of the Phoenix."<br />If you want a completely predictable, boring, entirely too long mess of a book, this would be it. In her determination not to be 'like' 'The Lord of the Rings', she destroyed her characters, and the incredible potential of what could have been...<br />I would almost believe that a different person wrote the last couple of books.
