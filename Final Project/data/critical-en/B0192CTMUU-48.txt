While I found "The Goblet of Fire" a very entertaining read, I was quite disappointed by the huge plot flaw which revealed itself at the end, nullifying the motivation for the entire book.  Without giving away the plot, there is no reason for the portkey at the end of the novel to be the object it is.  The whole plot hangs on this.  The bad guy could much more easily made something else the port key as soon as Harry gets back to Hogwarts and with a lot less fuss.<br />Because there is need for the port key to be the item in question, the verisimilitude of the novel crashes and burns.  I was especially disappointed because up until this point, I thought plotting was Rowling's greatest strength.  She sure blew it in book four.<br />Also, Harry drops the Marauder's Map when his leg is in the stair.  Fine. He tries to reach it.  Fine. But why doesn't he just say "Accio, Map!" just like he did the Firebolt, eh?  We know he knows that spell cold.  And after all, he uses that command to great effect in the climax.  Why not use it here? Couldn't think of any other way for Mad Eye Moody to get the map, J.K?  Tsk tsk.<br />wem
