After reading this book, I never knew a book could bring me to so many tears at once. This book has hurt me so bad emotionally and can for anyone else. The author is sick. From killing children to people being burned alive. This is the worst book I have ever read, it is so very cruel and very heartbreaking in so many ways. Almost everyone Katniss has loved dies in this book. Prim dies trying to save other kids that were blown to pieces and she wasn't even 14 years old. She chose Peeta and never sees Gale again pretty much. Peeta is worthless in this book, he's just psycho.<br /><br />I will not ever suggest this book to anyone ever.
