There was so much hype for this novel, it couldn't possibly live up to, and it didn't. I found the writing very sloppy and the plot loose, with some pretty shaky characterizations thrown into the mix to give it that real sloppy joe flavour. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if the themes and ideas hadn't been done so much better by Stephen King in "The Long Walk," and "The Running Man."<br /><br />But, if it will keep your kids reading, I suppose it's worth it. Just don't ask to read it after they're done with it.
