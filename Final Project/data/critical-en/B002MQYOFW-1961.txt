I liked the first book -- very much -- I liked the premise - the characters were well developed.  The visual descriptions were well done -- and at the end of the first book I was looking forward to the second book.  The second book was just a twist on the first with predictable outcomes and the third was more of the same.<br /><br />I did not like the technique of skipping forward with no explanation.  The author was very detailed until she skipped - I kept wondering if I had inadvertently missed a few pages.  The skipping ahead with no explanation was so out of character for the rest of the book.<br /><br />And, of course, the vivid descriptions will transfer to an action movie - or three - I wonder if any studios have thought of that too.(just kidding)
