I couldn't wait for the final installment, then couldn't wait for it to be over! I really enjoyed the first two, but Mockingjay left me feeling like the author was grasping for a story. The ending left something to be desired.  I respect authors hard work and creativity, which is why I feel bad for only giving this book 2 stars, but I truly found it a struggle to get through.
