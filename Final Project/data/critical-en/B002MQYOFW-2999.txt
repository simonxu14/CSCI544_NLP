Add me to the minority who did not find any redeeming factors in this book. If I spend my time reading, I hope to be entertained, educated, or enlightened. I found nothing close to this in The Hunger Games. With effort I finished reading it hoping something would put me in a positive frame of mind, but I snapped the cover shut with a bad taste in my mouth. When our teenagers find this a wonderful book, we are in deep trouble. Don't waste your time or money on this one. I certainly don't intend to read any further.
