Just rubbish, don't waste your money buying this trilogy. I've made a point of finishing it, and I swear, I've never had a harder time in my life!<br />I did like the beginning, I downloaded the free sample and liked what I read, but that was it, unfortunately. I am finding it boring and stupid, with a main character who really gets on my nerves, she is so silly and boring.
