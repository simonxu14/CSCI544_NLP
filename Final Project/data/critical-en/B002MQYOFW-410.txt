The series is a good, light one for easy reading. I did appreciate the development of a new type of world and evolved society. But I thought the third of the series was least enjoyable. It's a bit stretched out. More game-like more made for movie. The second built enough interest for me to finish the series. But at the end of it I don't think it'll be one that I necessarily remember and recommend. I'll watch the movies though...
