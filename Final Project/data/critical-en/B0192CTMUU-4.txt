Ordered to read on my iPad. For the first time, I received a digital book through Amazon that is virtually unreadable. Sentences begun at the bottom of one column are not continued at the top of the next column. Content is missing between pages. If I could give a zero rating, I would. Total waste of money. Let the buyer beware!
