The first book was a very entertaining amalgum of Running Man/The Lottery for the ever growing tween young adult consumer.  The second was a slightly rushed follow up that tried to expand the significance and political themes.  The third bordered on ridiculousness.  Had I not the type of personality that needs to stick with a story to the end I would've just quit after about a third of the way into this finale.  It feels like a thread that has been stretched so thin from the original story that it's ready to snap.  The very ending is also rushed with very few resolving details.  The final chapter and epilogue are so very (unintentionally and unartistically) vague.  It's almost as if a page limit was reached and Collins and her publisher just threw something together to appease readers about what happens after the "climax".  If you haven't started reading these yet, or you've only read The Hunger Games, stop while you're ahead.  You'll be better off.
