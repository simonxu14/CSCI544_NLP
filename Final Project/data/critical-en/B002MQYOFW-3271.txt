I hated this book!! I wish i never read it! I wanted to stop at page one but my friends forced me to read on! And now that im done i wish i did stop!! I hated the story line the setting the characters... everything!!! I mean prim was tolerable but no one else was! I do not recommend this irritating book nor do i understand the obsession!! All i can say besides this is BOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!
