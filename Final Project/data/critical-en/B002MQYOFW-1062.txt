I felt very let down by this book, and the only reason i finished it was because i already had invested in in the other books. I enjoyed the hunger games but did not feel it was as good as friends of mine said it was although i will admit that i enjoyed it. The second book felt less complete and continued to portray katniss in a less favorable light as the book continued, i would rather the book have been from peetas point of view. In the third book i could not stand katniss, she was weak and continued to act like a petulant child, not someone worthy of following. The book focused on things that seemed unimportant with a revolution taking place. I wont ruin it but i found the ending terribly disappointing.
