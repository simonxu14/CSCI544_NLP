not as enjoyable as the first 2 books. i find in this book katniss is a bit too .. how shall i say it .. whiny. i find it a bit annoying and distracting from the whole storyline, which is exciting and full of suspense by the way. nevertheless i want to know how it ends.. so i read the whole thing. i'll give it 3.5 if i can.
