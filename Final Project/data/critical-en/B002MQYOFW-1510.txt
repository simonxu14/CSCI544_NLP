**SPOILERS BEWARE**<br /><br />First, I must start off by saying how much I LOVED the first two books in this trilogy.  Couldn't get enough of them - devoured them within a week.  Finally, the long anticipated 3rd book...<br /><br />Sadly, this one fell short for me.  It was almost as though it was a "sophmore slump" that the second book usually is, but this was the final book...so I kept reading and reading, waiting for something compelling to leap off the page.  Unfortunately, that did not happen for me.  I still liked the book because it was part of the series, but I didn't love it for the following reasons that jump out at me:<br /><br />It was as though Katniss was just a follower in this book...a character who has NEVER been a follower, is just following along, ho-hum, during a war in the final book. How frustrating!  She didn't seem to be doing anything to really control her own destiny (besides killing Coin instead of Snow in the end)...things just happened to her and she went along for the ride.  Simple rule in writing-- the main character needs to solve his/her own problem.  I also thought this book was a lot more descriptive than the first two books with regard to the gore/brutality/death scenes, which I did not enjoy.  In the first two books, Collins had an artful way of writing and conveying an image without being overly gory, which I feel is a true talent.  This time it was overly descriptive and I missed her former writing style in that regard.<br /><br />Also, something that was somewhat insignificant, albeit preachy, that bothered me was early on...page 84 where she writes, "Frankly, our ancestors don't seem much to brag about.  I mean, look at the state they left us in, with the wars and the broken planet.  Clearly, they didn't care about what would happen to the people who came after them."  Hmm...being preachy about WAR when you've written a book about WAR?  Another simple rule in writing - Don't get preachy with your reader (even if it's ONLY 3 sentences which should have been marked out by the editor's pen).<br /><br />Now, on to the Gale/Peeta issue.  I feel like Katniss ended up with Peeta just by pure coincidence...kind of like "Oh well, Gale is in District 2 so I guess I'm stuck with Peeta instead".  SHE didn't make that decision, it was made FOR her because Gale was gone.  I wasn't convinced she would have chosen Peeta anyway.<br /><br />I think more should have been written about Katniss' thought process surrounding her "YES" vote for a Hunger Games with Capital family members.  I hated her for that vote...what was she thinking??  See, if Collins had truly put more effort into her main character in this book, I wouldn't HAVE to ask "what was she thinking" because I would have read it and therefore already known - I would have FELT what Katniss was thinking.<br /><br />I was heartbroken when Prim died, but it was written in such a confusing fashion that at first, I didn't know for sure if it happened or not.  I had to re-read that part a couple times.  I thought that the last few chapters were somewhat muddled - I had a hard time understanding if it was real or just a dream.  They felt rushed.  I really broke down when Prim's cat came home and Katniss was finally allowing herself to feel the pain of her sister's death.<br /><br />I so wanted to LOVE this book.  It really makes me wish there could be a "do over" in literature.  It will be interesting how it plays out on the big screen.
