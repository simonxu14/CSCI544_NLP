bought this before the movies came out and was excited to read the series.  The first book was great but I kind of lost interest half way into the 2nd book.  Even though the whole set is cheaper, it might be better to buy them separately if you are like me.  I havent finished the 2nd or started the 3rd.  Now that the movies came out, whats the point in reading the book.
