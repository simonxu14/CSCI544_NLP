I looked forward to this book for so long and it was a HUGE disappointment!<br /><br />I ended up hating all the characters and didn't care about them at all, nor to what happened to them.<br /><br />What happened?  If I wanted a a sad, pathetic, no hero story, I would watch an Obama news conference.<br /><br />This sucks. I am so sad.  I wanted a conclusion I could root for, be excited about, and love.<br /><br />What I got was a bad taste in my mouth and an empty place where Katniss, Peeta, and gale should be.
