The book got boring! It's hard to compete with her previous two books, how entertaining they became and grabbed the audience's attention with suspense, but at one point, I was about to put the book down. I was also very disappointed with the ending, not like every author should have a happy ending like Twilight, but at least an ending where I can go to sleep not unsettled and feeling like the whole series was a waste. Don't get me wrong, I love the hunger Games series and the characters and all, but in the end, it seemed like she got tired of writing and didn't want to make up a future for at least half of the characters she created. I understood the purpose of killing Prim, to end the story where it started, but there were a ton of unnecessary deaths, like Finnick and Boggs. And what about Peeta? Shouldn't the audience get the satisfactory that his mind is fixed and they can settle with the character the fell in love with in the first place?
