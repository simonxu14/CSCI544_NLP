I sort of forced myself to read this one because I read the first two and wanted to finish the series.  Also I like the movies a lot and wanted a preview of the final one coming later this year.<br />What bothered me most is the main character Katniss.  She operates on extreme emotion so often -- pouting, striking out at people who care for her, and throwing tantrums.  Yet she often gets good results from her emotional decisions.  The ending is just another example of that.<br />There were a lot of slow passages, interspersed with some decent action scenes.
