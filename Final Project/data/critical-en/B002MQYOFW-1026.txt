After enjoying the first two books in the series, I don't even have the words to describe how much I hated this book (or at least the last fifth of it).  I feel very set up by the author -- if I had any idea where she was going with this story, I wouldn't have read any of the books in the series. In fact, the dvd of the Hunger Games movie just came yesterday, and now I don't even want to watch it. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was more life affirming.  At least I know better than to ever read anything by this author again.
