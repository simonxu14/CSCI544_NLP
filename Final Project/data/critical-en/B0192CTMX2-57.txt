Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy this book, it's just my least favorite of the series. The first half was as good as ever, funny and witty, with a great plot. But the ending part is what ruined it for me, with it's humor feeling out of place in the seriousness of it. I still recommend it because it really is a good book, it's just my least favorite of the series.
