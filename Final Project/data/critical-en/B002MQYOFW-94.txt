I hate to rip on a book so highly anticipated as this one, I really do, but I feel I have to. This story could have been told in about 200 pages. We spend way too much time inside Katniss' head (which started getting redundant with the obvious early on)and not enough in what could have been a good, exciting, scary and dangerous storyline. By the end I wasn't caring who died, beside Prim - which was anticlimatic IMO, just that they did so we could move on. I knew Coin would be the target about half way through the book, and had to read that "sentence" twice, surprised (and disappointed) that I was right. The writing was just poor this time around and the sentence structure, from a writer's POV, was so off it was a major distraction while reading. I can't help but wonder if SC was under too much pressure from the publisher to get this book finished that she didn't have the time she needed to make it what The Hunger Games was - a good book.
