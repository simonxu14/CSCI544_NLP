I did not read the first two books so I had nothing to base my opinion on but this one. I found the writing to be somewhat childish. I expected better, especially with the subject matter.  There were many levels of emotions to explore but I felt the author just grazed over them. In most cases the book is better than the movie, but not in this case.
