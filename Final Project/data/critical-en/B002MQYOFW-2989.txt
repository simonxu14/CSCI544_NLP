Found it distasteful and hope the world never comes to this.  The fact that someone, even children, would be sacrificed just to get something to eat for their family is very upsetting, to say the least.  Reminds me of the Gladiator times, or even feeding Christians to the lions!  I had to put it down, rather than glorify it!
