Got this book for my son who was very excited about reading through it, however not long after he opened it it started to loose pages as they are very thin. At first I taped them back in because it was just a couple, but the longer he has it the more pages fall out. Unfortunately I waited to long to see about a return or refund, especially since it seems a new pages comes loose everyday.
