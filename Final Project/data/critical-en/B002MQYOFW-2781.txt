I got sucked into reading this series because of the popularity of &#34;The Hunger Games. I am a parent and a teacher, so because this book is about children, marketed to children, and popular with children, I thought I should read it.  Even as an adult I found these books very disturbing and depressing. I didn't want to read past the first book but I thought surely there would end up being something redeeming and worth while about them.  There was not. &#34;Catching Fire&#34; was the most disturbing book of all. Please don't let your children read this series. Even my 17 year old daughter didn't like it this book. I wish I'd stopped after the first book.
