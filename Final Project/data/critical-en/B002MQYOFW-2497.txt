I found the story unoriginal and characters relatively boring.  So many better books out there...<br /><br />Spoiler alert...<br />When they changed the rules of the games to allow two people from the same district to win, I thought to myself, "it's going to be totally lame and uncreative if they change the rules back and Katniss and Peeta have to fight each other."  Well what do you know....
