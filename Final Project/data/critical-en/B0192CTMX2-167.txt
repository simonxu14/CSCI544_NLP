I'd recommend the book, on the whole, but it was a disappointing (and perhaps prematurely published) capstone to the series . . . too many "deus ex machina" loose ends, too many "functional" (but unsatisfying) plot contrivances. Were I J.K.'s editor, I'd have excised the last chapter (fast-forward to the future) altogether, preferring to leave the story open-ended rather than to guillotine it that way.
