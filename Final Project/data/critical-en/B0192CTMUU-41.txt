After reading the first three books of the series and waiting for the latest one, I must say it was worth the wait.  It captured all the  desperation and past plot lines that made the third book so cool, and  developed the characters well, just like in the first two books.  I loved  how the story line shifts into another darker tone with the arrival of  Voldemort, which will carry on to the final three books.  Once again,  Rowling tricked with her clever characters and use of magic to explain the  plot.  I just wish I hadn't finished it on July 12...
