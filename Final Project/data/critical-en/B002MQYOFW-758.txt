The character development does not go beyond one dimension, and the characters do not show growth.  Characters are killed off in far too graphic of description in some cases and in others for seemingly no reason.  While the basic story is good it is bizarre to me to think that this is considered a young adult novel for the graphic violence and silly &#34;romantic&#34; portions.<br /><br />Still worth a read but not nearly worthy of the hype.
