The book is good. I like it but little disappointed.. The charaters seems very aimless in this book. Katniss is most of the time in hospital or maniac or broken. Not as spirited as she was in first 2 novel.. Didn't understand why she was needed at all on fight as rebels brought the Capitol down..  Last few chapter were excellent when she kills the coin..
