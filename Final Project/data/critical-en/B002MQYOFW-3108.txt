I'm writing this to hopefully keel others from making the mistake of reading these reviews like I did. I came her to read some reviews after I finished the book only to find A LOT of people (idiots and a-holes) reviewing the whole series and giving away the ending without spoiler tags. If you're thinking of reading the whole series, take my advice and don't risk reading any of the reviews posted here.<br /><br />As for the book, it was okay.
