Sigh. After two strong books the author gets in over her head. Katniss' personal melodrama gets ratcheted up to eleven. I quickly tired of reading about how she distrusts everyone/blames herself for everything. The 'war' and the last chapters in general seemed very rushed. I will applaud the political outcome of the book, which seems realistic, if not exactly optimistic.<br /><br />There are so many stories about the history and back-story of Panem and its inhabitants that I think would have been much more interesting than Katniss' endless angst. How DID the Hunger Games really arise? How WAS Panem founded? What DID happen to the human race? How close to the edge of survival are we really?<br /><br />We get no answers to these questions and I'm not sure Suzanne Collins had any. Her fictional universe revolves around Katniss, and therein, I think, lies the problem.
