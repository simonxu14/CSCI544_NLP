Like a lot of other reviewers I loved the first two books.  But this one felt vague and unfocused.  SPOILER ALERT. And what was the point of Prim's death?  She was the reason for Katniss' volunteering.  We already know war is awful so what purpose did Prim's death serve?  Maybe the point was to show that Katniss was the ultimate victim.  She ended up being used by everyone.  Wow, how uplifting.  This book destroyed the series for me.  All the strength in the first two books was gone.  This book was a letdown, very disappointing.
