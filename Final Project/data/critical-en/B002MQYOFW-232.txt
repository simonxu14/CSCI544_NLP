Mockingjay was one of the worst books I've ever read; a complete and utter disappointment. It didn't take me long to read the first book and i found it quite enticing. I loved the plot, the characters, the whole idea! The second book didn't quite live up to my expectations, but i have to say, i enjoyed it. Mockingjay doesn't even compare. I do not mean this in a good way. I kept waiting for something to happen, something to thrill me or at least make me somewhat interested. I felt depressed the whole way through. Suzanne Collins made a mistake, a HUGE mistake in my opinion, no, several mistakes.<br /><br />SPOILERS!-----------SPOILERS!---------SPOILERS!<br /><br />KATNISS:<br />What happened?! What could have possibly happened to that brave, lovable protagonist? She's just a whiny do-nothing now. I can't believe it's the same character! Katniss, the Mockingjay, the sign of hope, what happened? She spent the entire book sedated in the hospital, hiding from her fears in a closet, or just feeling sorry for herself. I've been thinking, "Toughen up! I know your life is rough, but you can do better than that! What did you say about your mother? Oh yeah, i remember. You said for a while you hated her for not helping you after your father died. Isn't this exactly what you're doing except worse?" Gale and Peeta deserve better than Katniss. If she's gonna live her life feeling sorry for herself instead of moving on, forget her.<br /><br />PEETA:<br />The soft, warm, affectionate character has turned into a raving lunatic. Do we ever find out if he gets completely cured, still feels urges to kill Katniss, or resorts to pain to pull himself into reality? Why aren't we told these things? Why has he been so suicidal? So he can help the mission? Oh please.<br /><br />Gale:<br />Whatever happens to him? All Suzanne Collins says is he moves on with his life and gets a good job. Glad to hear that much, but what else? What is his job? Does he have a new girl? How could he have just abandoned Katniss without even speaking to her after Prim died? He couldn't have just forgotten about her, not if they have been such close friends over the years. We have practically no information about how he turns out! He's like some minor character not worthy of an explanation. Really Suzanne Collins? Really?<br /><br />PRIM:<br />Yes, war is horrible and takes even those we love dear, but what was Prim even doing in the front lines!? No matter her skills, they couldn't possibly leave a thirteen-year-old at such vulnerability! Prim was one of my favorite characters too, so how could Collins write her death the way she did? I didn't even know right away Prim died. I just knew Katniss was burning and getting some crazy hallucinations .<br /><br />OTHER CHARACTERS:<br />What becomes of Haymitch? Or Annie at that matter? Annie was unstable to begin with, but with Finnick dead, how's she coping? I was just beginning to like Finnick when he dies and is just brushed off like another soldier. Katniss's mother, why doesn't she visit Katniss after Prim's death? Surely it must be really hard on her too. I nearly forgot to mention about Mags. Collins hinted in the second book Mags and Gale might like each other, so what happens? Is she alive and seeing Gale often?<br /><br />I could write a better ending! Questions are left unanswered, characters are unlikable, the writing isn't even that great. It's a jumble and confusing. Readers should know what's going on without being told. They should be in on the action and have the details. Suzanne Collins spent way too much time explaining something that we already know (war is horrible) and not enough time on the answers. This book was flawed. By ruining this last book, the entire series was ruined. There's nothing worse than having an excellent plot and series destroyed by a bad ending. I read books to ENJOY! Not to feel sad and depressed! There's enough of that in life, we need more sunshine and hope; more reasons to love life and hope for the best. Nobody likes a depressing person, so why do writers often try to turn us into one? I may be insulting, but this book was an insult to me. I'm so glad i read the series after all the books came out instead of gaining time to build up my anticipation and expectations.
