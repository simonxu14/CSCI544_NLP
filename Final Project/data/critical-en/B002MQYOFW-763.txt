As a former philosophy professor, I must say that I loved The Hunger Games and Catching Fire for many reasons.  First of all, The Hunger Games portrayed a convincing interpretation of a Hobbesian "State of Nature" (a war of all against all, in which life is nasty, brutish, and short) that could be right at home in any political philosophy course.  In addition, the very concept of The Hunger Games (the actual event in the arena) is filled with such irresistible existential horror that the reader cannot help but be drawn in to confront his or her own mortality (and sense of objective morality).  And the second novel in the series, Catching Fire, takes a proven story concept (the games) and perverts it even further, in a satisfying way, by requiring participation from previous Hunger Games victors.<br /><br />However, despite the many virtues of the first two novels in the series, Mockingjay falls flat because of a fundamental flaw.  Instead of presenting a new variation on a proven theme (games in the arena), Mockingjay offers a very ordinary and predictable post-apocalyptic rebellion plot that could have occurred in any other story from this genre.  Politics and war action replace the gloriously macabre existential moment of standing on the pedestal during the countdown to the start of the games.<br /><br />Although the trilogy is now complete, I hope that Suzanne Collins reads this review before writing a Hunger Games prequel.  There is still a good story to be told: the very first Hunger Games and how this satisfyingly twisted world (and the Hunger Games event in particular) came to be.  Please return to the heart of the series, and its namesake: the actual Hunger Games themselves, which are the heart of everything unique and interesting about this world and its characters.
