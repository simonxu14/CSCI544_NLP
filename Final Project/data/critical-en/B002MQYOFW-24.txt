*SEVERE SPOILERS*<br /><br />In short, I have never felt so let down by a book before in my life. And it's such a shame because the author so beautifully built up the conflict and could not execute it properly in the last 20% of the book. It's as if she built this amazing house of cards - primed for it all to come tumbling down, thematically and plot-wise - but then decided to leave it standing and build another semi-related house of cards instead.<br /><br />I'm reading Mockingjay last night. I'm up to 72 or 73% on it in my Kindle. I'm loving it. It's even a candidate for one of my favorite books ever. Katniss is on a mission to assassinate President Snow. She's running through the city, tacklings all sorts of obstacles. I'm deeply, emotionally invested in the story, especially in the dynamic between Peeta and her - in the sense that I found his memory loss/transformation to be incredibly heart-breaking and a wonderfully effective plot device. So I'm expecting - HOPING - that Katniss will run up like a bad ass, infiltrate the mansion like a bad ass, have a heart-to-heart with President Snow like a bad ass, who will give Katniss some sort of antidote that will heal Peeta's condition. In exchange, he will ask for immunity, to allow the Capitol to remain in power, but under far more equal and peaceful terms. Katniss will refuse, take the antidote anyway, kill Snow, restore Peeta, save the world, make the choice between Peeta and Gale, and reconcile all the leftover plot points that were left dangling - and beautifully built up by the author.<br /><br />So imagine my shock when, out of nowhere, bombs start falling on a bunch of kids for no reason. And then they kill Prim. For no reason. Turns it's a plot twist. For no reason. Turns out Coin is the bad (?) guy. For no reason. Then Katniss not only doesn't kill Snow, she doesn't get to play an active part in restoring Peeta. His recovery is attributed to "time," which is bs. Gale is suddenly out of picture for convenience sake. In short, nothing gets resolved except fo the conflict between the Capitol and the Districts. And we don't even get to see that! As was the case in the last book, all the reading we as the audience did between the bombing of District 8 until the bombs fall was completely useless. It was fantastically built up, but never fully realized.<br /><br />I feel this book - and the last one, which suffered from the same problems, in my opinion - should have been from Plutarch's perspective. Katniss did not play an active or important enough role in this book to warrant it being from her perspective in the slightist. In both books, she was a passive observer and not an active participant in the world. None of the conflicts are really addressed beyond convenient paragraphs and summaries, and all of these conflicts really deserved full chapters of devotion. Katniss' active redemption of Peeta (and herself, for that matter) - which should have occurred as a direct result of the same actions that would have saved the world - would have been so cathartic and so wonderful if it had been pulled off properly.<br /><br />Katniss and Gale could have worked out their differences. Haymitch could have at least stopped drinking. Something! One character needed to grow and become better as a result of this story. It's certainly possible - and I think very likely - that the author wanted to make a thematic statement and perhaps throw in some social criticism. However, this theme of "war in general sucks" is never seriously thrown into the theme until the last 10% of the book, which ends up dictating the entire resolution - or lack thereof - in the end of the book. This thematic device therefore came off rather poorly in my opinion. I think this book suffered from what the other books had; I personally felt each of the books could have used one or two more drafts because it all felt disjointed, overly-convenient in terms of plotting, and Katniss' role was far too passive and useless.<br /><br />So I'm left at the end of the book, my veins throbbing in my head, and my hands outstretched, palms up, over my shoulders in an eternal shrug, with my mouth agape, as I try to figure out what the heck the author was thinking when she figuratively derailed every plot point, every character, every tendril of good plotting she had built up for over 200 pages (over 600 if you include the previous books).<br /><br />I will say, in compliment to this book, that the annoying tell-and-don't-show style of writing that was very prevalent in the first two books (and almost caused me to stop reading the second book), is significantly decreased in this one. So I think the writing itself is actually better in this book. Or perhaps I got used to these things and dismissed them as a stylistic thing.<br /><br />I give this book 3 stars for the still-awesome world the author created, and the plot she built up. But in my opinion, a few more drafts were necessary to really figure out how to resolve those plot points, which in my opinion, were completely derailed and almost disregarded by the end of this book.
