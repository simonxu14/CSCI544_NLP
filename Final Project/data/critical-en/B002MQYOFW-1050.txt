Was disappointed in her choosing but saw it coming.  It was a bit draggy in parts but then I sat and read three books all very fast.  Maybe I just expected too much.  Do believe this is a case of reading the books first  and then seeing what &#34;Hollywood&#34; does with the story was the best way to get the most out of the story.
