I picked this up to read once the movie was out, figuring I should find out what all the fuss was about. I enjoyed reading the book and found Katniss' character interesting, but overall I'm not blown away any particular aspect.<br /><br />The story is set in some post-apocalyptic future where the Capitol rules over twelve districts. In the aftermath of a rebellion, the Capitol has established the Hunger Games, in which two teenagers from each district are chosen by lottery to fight to the death in a wilderness arena. We are told that the games are part punishment for the districts' rebellion. They are also televised, with all inhabitants of the districts being forced to watch select parts. This is also supposed to display the power of the Capitol. I didn't quite believe this reasoning, but just accepted it and read on.<br /><br />Katniss has had a tough time after her father's death in the mines. When her mother became severely depressed, Katniss became the only source of food and goods for herself, her mother, and her younger sister. At the lottery for District Twelve, Katniss's sister is chosen to participate. Incapable of letting her sister go to a certain death, Katniss volunteers to take her place.<br /><br />The majority of the book covers the preparation for the games and then follows Katniss' exploits in the arena, a mainly wooded wilderness. With her experience as an illicit hunter in her own district, Katniss quickly becomes one of the favorites in the competition. There are plot twists and other important characters - Peeta, the other participant from District Twelve, Rue, Cato, and Cinna.<br /><br />I thought that parts of the ending were predictable, while one facet was not. I wish that some of the plot threads had been wrapped up better, but I am aware that there are two more books, so I expect that those problems will lead into the next book. I plan to see the movie and read the sequel, but I don't have any immediate need to plunge right into it. Overall - a good solid plot and protagonist, but I'm still puzzled as to why it has become so popular.
