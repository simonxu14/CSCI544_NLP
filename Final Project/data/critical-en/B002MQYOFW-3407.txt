this third installment of this series SUCKED!!! I'm very pissed off that I spent money on this book ... the author really really didn't do her best job and it reads as if she was not caring about the story. I was anticipating for a good read but was slapped in the face by the poorness of the ending, it lacked the "happy ending" and made the whole series pointless.. I will never never allow my 13yr old to ever read this series... it sucked so badly and the "happy ever after" ending never happens. It felt like it was just a rushed job. And it was a crappy book, and very F-up ending that makes me want to throw the whole collection into the trash can where it belongs, And now that I read the whole series I will NEVER take my daughter to see any of the movies!! I say Shame on you to the scholastic corp. for printing and publicity of this series to our young children... I recommend that as parents we should Boycott this book and take it out of our schools libraries.. AND ABOVE ALL ELSE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAPPY SERIES.. BECAUSE IT SUCKS!!! I want a Refund the author is a crook that stole my money and left me with nothing...
