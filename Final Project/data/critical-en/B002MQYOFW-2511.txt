"The Hunger Games" is a wonderfully written tale set in the future where children are pitted against each other in gladiatorial like games. At face value, the book, which is a highly entertaining read, seems destined to become a classic. The author does an amazing job conveying the main character's thoughts and emotions as she is thrown through one terrible ordeal after another.<br /><br />The problem with the book is that the storyline did not end with any major surprises. I kept waiting for a plot twist that never occurred. The storyline ended almost exactly where I thought it would. Worse, the ending was abrupt and incomplete. That said, the book is part of a series, and presumably the storyline is not over. I was also dissatisfied that the book did not provide me with any deeper insight into humanity nor did it force me to look at the world differently. If there was a moral or point to the story I failed to understand it.<br /><br />To summarize, the author of the book did everything right. Perhaps that is the problem with the book. Because the author did everything right, the story feels too synthetic, too manufactured.
