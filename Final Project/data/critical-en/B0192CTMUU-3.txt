I was very excited to finally own a hard copy version of a Harry Potter book amd the package arrived on time and was in good condition. However, when I opened the book itself, I found that pages 333-336 were totally shredded. I was so sad at this because I wanted to start reading immediately. How can I fix this, Amazon? I live in Trinidad and Tobago.
