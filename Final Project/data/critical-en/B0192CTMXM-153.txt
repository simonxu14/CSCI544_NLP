The earlier books sold primarily because of the immersive, warm, healing effect they conveyed emotionally.  They weren't particularly innovative, viewed objectively (consider the second, which begins with Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and concludes with the hero stabbing a giant snake with a magic sword) but they did make you feel good at least.<br />Phoenix waves away that emotional formula in favor of a more ambitious design, and so the book is  being praised for its "improved" depth and maturity... but the end result doesn't achieve anything very useful or innovative in the process.<br />Rather, it transforms this series from classic children's fiction into mediocre-to-poor teen-audience fantasy.  This book tries to stir eight-year-old sex drive into  thirteen-year-old teen angst, and the unfortunate results aren't very tasty.<br />Whiny, annoying characters, a slow plot which doesn't make a great deal of sense, a lot of condescendingly overt symbolism, scenes which feature so many people we aren't even sure who's there (and many of whom turn out after 870 pages to have been useless and serve no apparent function), settings that don't inspire but rather bore (magical governmental offices?!), and not even much of an exciting or surprising adventure story.<br />As just one example,  consider the military tactics of Dumbledore.  Confronted with the reincarnation of the most evil Dark wizard of all time, his heroes spring into action by... housecleaning.<br />I am not making this up.<br />The earlier books featured surprises, twists, unexpected revelations.  This book offers nothing like that.  If a character seems to be X, rest assured, s/he is X.  The end.<br />Worse still, the story proceeds at such a glacial pace, and is so tediously, terribly long, it's twice as bad as a normal bad book.  Nothing of any relevance to the plot really happens until the six hundred twentieth page (if you don't believe  me, look it up).<br />Order of the Phoenix is like the 72 oz steak the Texas restaurant dares patrons to eat... but if you finish the whole thing, you don't get it free. You have to pay twice as much.<br />Any child old enough to understand, follow, and appreciate the Order of the Phoenix would be much better off reading something such as Eddings' Belgariad or Watership Down, both of which are vastly better designed, better written and more satisfying.
