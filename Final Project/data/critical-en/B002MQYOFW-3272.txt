I'll admit it--I'm probably a little too old for this book, which may have a lot to do with my opinion. But a friend of mine was going on about it, and it was on sale, and I needed a short read on the flight back to school. So I bought it.<br /><br />To Collins' credit, the book IS a page turner. But the reason for said page-turning switched abruptly as soon as the fluffy teen romance started up--at some point, I just wanted it to be over.<br /><br />While the MC, a 16-year-old pseudo-tomboy named Katniss, is at once more likable than her Twilight counterpart (largely due to her take-no-prisoners attitude to anyone who isn't close friend or family), the charade gets rather stale after hearing how much her personally is tamped down (or amped up) by her stunning skills with archery. And botany. And stealth. She's also apparently attractive, though, of course, she doesn't know this.<br /><br />I was willing to overlook all this, even the somewhat nauseating romantic aspects, until I started seeing slightly modified Twilight scenes--a night sharing a sleeping bag with a feverish boy (alright, so werewolves aren't fevered in Forks, but they do run a temperature); a hallucination involving Katniss seeing a potential love interest 'sparkling' in the sunlight; even a *POSSIBLE SPOILER* battle against half-human, half-wolf creatures.<br /><br />I mean, really?<br /><br />All in all, it seems like Ms. Collins covers up the aspects borrowed from elsewhere with an admittedly intriguing plot, plus a post-apocalyptic setting.<br /><br />I give the book two stars, because I am confident Twilight fans everywhere will rave. And it's nice to see a female heroine who can hold her own.
