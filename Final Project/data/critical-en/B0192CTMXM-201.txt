I was lead on a rollercoaster ride that ran out of steam. JKR did a good job of wrapping up story lines, answering the biggest cliff hanger since "Who shot JR?", and humanizing characters with faults and fears like everyone has. However, what she also did was use ALOT of excess verbiage that was absolutely not needed and tended to drag, over simplify situations that really needed more depth, and worse of all, bowed to the money with a "Hollywood" ending. It was anticlimactic at the best, it left me feeling....nothing, one death was a little touching but even it happened fast with no lead in so you really didn't care, and the others were just...humph...whatever. You spend the majority of your time with Harry and his usual angst and ignorance till things are handed to him, and Voldamort, who really had no use but to laugh manically and be stupid. The best part of the book was brining out an unexpected hero in the end who you have always secretly rooted for and finally got his happy ending. It simply pales in comparison to the build, character development, and overall care to story she took in the rest of her books. I was really disappointed. :{
