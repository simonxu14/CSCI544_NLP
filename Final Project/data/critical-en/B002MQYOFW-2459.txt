I bought the trilogy on a recommendation from a friend - after reading the 1st book I was disappointed with the lack of creativity, and 80% through the 2nd, I had to stop, finally realizing these books are for teenage girls - it is poor science fiction - young people need to read Bradbury - Asimov - Clark -  Heinlein - and so on....
