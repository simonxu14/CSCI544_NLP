I didn't enjoy these books at all.  I read them because I was reading them with a student I tutor.  I found Katniss fatuous and boring as a character.  Peeta and Gale had a lot more going for them, as did Prim, and Finnick. Even Haymitch was more interesting. Cinna was a more intriguing person, who took great risks, but he's tossed off with hardly a care. The action scenes were pretty good, which is why I give the book/s three stars.  The whole time I was reading them, however, I felt like they could have been condensed into one and that would have made a much better story. Cut out all of Katniss's self-serving introspection and then the books would hum along a lot better.  Aside from these issues, I really find the idea of children killing children for the sport and viewing pleasure of adults reprehensible, and that the books' intended audience is children, even more so.
