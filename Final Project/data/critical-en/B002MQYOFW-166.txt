I just finished reading Mockingjay and all I can say is that, like many of the other one- and two-star reviews, I absolutely loved the first two books and completely hated this one. The first half of the book is for the most part Katniss being ferried around an underground bunker and being told what's happening rather than actively engaging in the events. Just when you think the action's about to pick up, it falls flat. Most characters just kind of fizzle out or are killed off in a couple of lines. The main characters that we've come to know and care about throughout the course of the series are flat and very unlikable.<br /><br />My only hope is that the movie version is drastically different from the book.
