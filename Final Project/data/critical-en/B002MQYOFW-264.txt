This book is so different from the other two, it was vary well written but to tell yours u the truth I wish I had never read it. Because after I was done with it I didn't feel that love for the series like I did after reading the other two, but don't get me wrong the ending was AMAZING! And I did cry in a few parts. Overall I give this book three starsðŸ˜„
