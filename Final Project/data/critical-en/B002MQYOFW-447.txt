Once you are this far into it, you might as well finish the series off. I did not like the ending well at all, but I suppose it was right for the series. Still fairly well written but just about as disappointing as the fifth Harry potter book or the final twilight book. The main character tanks, but by then you care so much about everyone else, you have to see what happens.
