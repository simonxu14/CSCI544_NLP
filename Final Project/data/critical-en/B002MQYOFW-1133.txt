Good to have a resolution to the series, but I found it unsatisfying. Katniss has become a very unsympathetic main character, and I felt that some deaths were thrown in simply to add to her trauma. I would have preferred more heroics, but the last chapter of Hunger Games is still done well enough to keep me reading.
