I really enjoyed the first two books and since this is a trilogy of course had to read this, the 3rd and final book.<br />It was dark, rambling and annoying. By the end I was ready to kill Katniss myself just to have it finished.<br />I wish the author would have written this book with the same passion and rhythm as 1 & 2.
