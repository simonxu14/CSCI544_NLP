I was really excited for this book. I absolutely LOVED the first one and the second one had such a surprising twist in the end how could you NOT love it. This one, was a disappointment compared to the first two. Maybe I liked them more due to the arena adding a never-ending level of excitement, not expecting what was to come next out of the woods. This one didn't answer a lot of the questions I wanted answered, and left me feeling like it was a waste of my six hours to read.<br /><br />The first problem was Prim dying. In the very first book, Katniss volunteers herself for the games just so that wouldn't happen. Why would you kill her off at the end of the revolution, it made little sense to me. The whole reason she was even in The Hunger Games, and eventually becomes the face of the revolution is because she takes her sister's place. The death seemed so unnecessary. Like Finnick's death. That bothered me too, I was just warming up to him when he goes and get killed by mutations then blown up.<br /><br />Now on to the next bit. I was very interested in the red-headed Avox who Katniss saw running through the woods, then runs into again during her time as a tribute. I wanted to know more about her, not just her name and how she died. That irritated the hell out of me.<br /><br />On to the romance. I was always one for Peeta and Katniss coming together, but the way it happened wasn't what I wanted. I wanted their relationship to grow throughout the book, as it had done in the previous ones. I wanted them to rediscover each other after he came back with his illness that made him want to kill her. I expected so much from this and all we got out of them, any form of raw emotion was the kiss she gave him. That was it. I felt the author completely avoided the romance almost all together. Wasn't this a big part of the first two? Who will she choose, Gale or Peeta? Then we have to accept the fact they grew up and had kids together. Not much detail.<br /><br />Even though I wasn't a Gale fan, I don't think they should have just dropped their friendship the way it happened. This also goes with not killing Prim, considering his bomb may have been the one that did it. They were friends for five years - hunting, surviving, and helping each other's families. Then they just drop all that? He goes and gets a job in District 2, and she goes and lives with Peeta in District 12.<br /><br />I'm kind of rambling, considering I can't rant to my friends about this until they read the book. So I'll leave it at that for now.
