Borrow this book from your local library. The reader learns almost nothing new about the characters, except maybe for Aunt Petunia, but the plot doesn't thicken past what we learned about Harry and Lord Voldemort in the fourth book.<br />I understand that pubescent young adults go through a rebellious stage. But couldn't Rowling have given the progatonists an identity crisis to preserve what we like about them -- rather than make all of them plain angry and obnoxious? Harry and Ron were not likable. Authors of young adult books rarely make the characters obnoxious to indicate that they are going through changes. There are other ways to imply that.  Oh well. We writers learn from each other's mistakes.<br />Sirius and Lupine were flat characters with no personality, as were ALL of the other characters. This book was not loved by the author when it was being written.
