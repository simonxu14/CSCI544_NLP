*Spoilers*<br />I enjoyed the first two books; especially the first.  With the third though, it really was all over the place.  Trying to do way too much in a single short book with pacing better suited for the arena only.  Some things that I though were pretty weird (out of many):<br /><br />The people escaping by the lake to District 13.  We have this whole ordeal about meeting them, finding out about the districts, how they survived, sharing food and on and on.  Later we mark the plot check box. Verdict: Apparently they didn't make it. What a waste of pages.<br /><br />The love triangle with Peeta and Gale was closed off very poorly.  I wouldn't care if she ended up with Gale, Peeta, no one or one of the camera guys but, can we find out why please?  Instead, Peeta magically gets back in love, right after starting to see all the flaws with Kat.  Gale just is gone working somewhere.  No need for more info apparently.<br /><br />The whole bomb the children thing did not work in so many ways.  It makes my head hurt how forced that was.<br /><br />I realize to some this is the best book in the world.  My guess is that the long term average will be 3.5 stars at best.
