Yes, the book kept my interest and I did not find it too long. But for me she doesn't know when to tone down the exaggerations that make the story unbelievable (give one accepts the magical world). So many characters are over the top that it is hard to accept that no one seems to notice. Draco and his father might as well have "evil" tattooed on their foreheads. Crabbe and Goyle could never have made it this far in the school, Snape's malevolence is getting really boring, it is unbelievable that an incompetent fool like Fudge is Minister of Magic, and the Inquisitor Umbridge is so extreme as to be totally unbelievable. Her books would be far stronger with a bit more subtlety.
