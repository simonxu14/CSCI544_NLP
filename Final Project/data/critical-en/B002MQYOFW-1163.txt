I ordered this boxed set for my daughter for Christmas, and<br />Although she loved it, I was disappointed in the printing quality.<br />Some pages were blurry and hard to read and one book even<br />Had entire sections out of order so she had to jump around in<br />The book to find the right page...disappointing.
