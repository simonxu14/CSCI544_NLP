I found the whole idea of the Hunger games interesting and something that sheds a different view on our world becomes dominated by the media and silly TV shows. As far as the trilogy concerns. It is a good read and really movie like, visually strong text, the third book was a bit too much and tired. I think it should've been fit into two voulmes.
