Mockingjay is the last of the Hunger Games Trilogy.  It follows Katniss as she learns about District 13 which is a communist sort of society. No capitalism for sure.  People don't get to see much sun and all eat the same meager servings of food.  No one starves but people are programmed. Katniss struggles against this and is considered basically mentally off but they can't get rid of her anymore than anyone else as she is a symbol.<br /><br />The book follows the rebellion and Katniss is used as a show piece for the rebels but manages as time goes on to make contributions to the resistance.<br /><br />One of the problems with these books is that there is no basis for her thoughts and actions. There has never been a culture without some sort of belief in a higher power or some sort of standards.  This is sort of like modern television from which the author acknowledged she got her ideas from.  It has all the morality of reality tv which is to say none.  Katniss is supposed to be good but kills a woman when she breaks in her home without a thought.  The woman is an innocent bystander who could have been tied up instead but is shot dead.  The book ends with little hope for people.  I guess this is what modern day media is creating. A little grim for the young.
