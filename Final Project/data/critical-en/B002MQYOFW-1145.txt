Book was enjoyable to read and difficult to put down, but I found the plot a little unbelievable and many parts were unnecessary. It did keep me guessing which was good, and there were a few twists which was good. Still felt like I was reading the whole time rather than being transported into the world of the characters. I found the writing awkward at times. Still enjoyable to read, and the ending was well suited.
