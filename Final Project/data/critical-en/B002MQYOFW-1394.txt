I read the first two thrilling and absorbing books in this series intensely, unwilling to put them down.  They are magnificent and I recommend them without reservation.<br /><br />"Mockingjay" is another kettle of fish.  I was unwilling to put it down, but in this case it was because I kept waiting and hoping for it to rise to the level of the others.  But this doesn't happen.  On the contrary, Mockingjay gets progressively worse and the ending is totally without rationality, consistency, or decency.<br /><br />I imagine the publisher screaming at Ms. Collins "We have a hot one here, and we have to strike while the iron is hot.  Don't worry about getting it right, just get it written!"<br /><br />I won't get more specific because I don't want to write a spoiler review.  But if you loved the first two books as I did, do yourself a favor and don't pollute your glowing memories by reading this piece of rot.
