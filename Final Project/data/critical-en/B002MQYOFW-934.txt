This book is a contradiction. It's written really well but the story is disturbing and it's hard for me to understand what kids like about it so much. If it was like a modern day 1984 or Animal Farm or something comparing modern times or the Arab Spring or something but I think it's all just fantasy which is just disturbing. And the rest of the trilogy doesn't do much better.
