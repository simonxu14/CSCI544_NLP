Love, love, loved the first two books. Seemed obvious to me that Peeta was her true love, Gale more like a brother. I couldn't wait for Katniss to save Peeta from himself in Mockingjay. Instead she abandons him. And Gale too really.  There was zero heart in this book.<br />There was no point whatsoever to katniss's special mission, other than killing everyone in her squad- including Finnick. And prim's death is pointless too. Most of the book is just Katniss wandering around aimlessly. I'm glad she ended up with Peeta, but they had like no scenes together and I feel cheated. It was truly an awful conclusion, and I hated it. I hope the screenwriter completely changes it.
