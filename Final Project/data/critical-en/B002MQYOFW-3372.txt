I enjoyed reading the Hunger Games Trilogy, but what seemed unrealistic to me is that there is not the slightest vestige of religion evident in the society depicted in these books. I think it safe to say that virtually every human society has some form of religion, so why does this one not even hint at religious belief?<br /><br />I also found it strange that adolescent children could kill other human beings with almost no feelings of revulsion or guilt. From what I've read of real-life killings, even in self-defense people usually puke their guts out because killing another person is such a violation of one's human nature. Even hardened soldiers find it difficult to deal with the deeds they are required to commit in the heat of battle, so it just doesn't seem very believable that kids in the Hunger Games could slaughter one another with only the slightest twinge of conscience or remorse.
