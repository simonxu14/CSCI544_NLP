So glad I waited for all three books to be out in print I really do not like to wait for books to come out when they have the cliff hangers like this one.  I absolutely loved the first two books. in the second book just when you think the Capitol can not get anymore twisted they do.  Could not put them down.<br /><br />  I read the last book in the Hunger games and I did not like it as much... it was really weird and I felt she jumped around and lost me a few times.  I also hated that they killed Prim on purpose.  It made me feel like there is really no hope for humanity in that kind of scenario.  You would think that out of the ashes of all that pain and suffering more good would have come out of it. it The absolute inhumanity of human kind in this book is so sad.
