This book was just ok for me.  I wanted to know what all the hype was about so I read the book, watched the movie and then read the 2nd and 3rd books of the series.<br />  I really enjoy the Dystopian genre... But this trilogy was my least favorite of my recent reads.  If you're looking for something similar but better.... Try the Divergent series by Veronica Roth!
