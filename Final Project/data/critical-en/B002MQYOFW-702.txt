This wasn't a horrible book, by any means.  Collins managed to resolve many different issues with many different characters.  But the way to do that could have been done without killing a great many characters that we had grown to appreciate.  Some of them outright deserved it.  But to kill off the District 4 tribute that had begun to make us smile, and after all he had been through and achieved?  No.  That was a huge misstep on the author's part.<br /><br />I gave the book three stars because while she does get the whole Katniss/Peeta thing figured out, it also makes you wonder why she even bothered with attempting a triangle between Katniss/Peeta/Gale in the first place.  There was just no purpose with it.  Not really angsty, no real drama behind it.  The closest you get in the whole series is when Peeta gets irritated with Gale.  But while Gale supposedly "loves" Katniss, it never really rings true and becomes a misused plot device.<br /><br />Read the book.  Then go write some better fanfiction.
