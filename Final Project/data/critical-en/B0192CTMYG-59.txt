I received the CD box with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Book 1) and was disappointed that is was not well protected. It was dented at both ends. If I had been a collector I would be very disappointed. I did not return it since I just wanted to record it and listen to it on my iPod. After openining the lid would not stay in. I kept poping out...making it easy for the 2 cases to fall out if it lay flat. The CD were great, however; they were not damaged.
