I love the series, but the final book's characterization of the major characters was a disappointment.  I felt it was rushed and not as well structured as the first two.  I still enjoyed it, but wished that the romance could have been better handled.  The final fight was only slightly interesting.  Perhaps it was because I read all three books in one long weekend.<br /><br />Still, I do recommend the series.
