The book itself was great, I would give it four stars but the audiobook was atrocious! Do yourself a favor and actually read the book, don't waste your money on the audiobook.  The narrator's voice does not work for this "young" character, I kept picturing a 40 year old as Katniss, not a (16?) year old.  Also annoying was that she pronounced "Hazel" as "Hazelle" which was just completely ridiculous and annoyed the crap out of me.<br /><br />Unfortunately the same person narrates all the books in the trilogy so there isn't any hope it get's better in books 2 and 3. I'm just hoping they realize their mistake and remake them because this was just so bad.
