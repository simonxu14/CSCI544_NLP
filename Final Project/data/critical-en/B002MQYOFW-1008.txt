I couldn't get enough of the first two books, but this book has me torn. I really didn't see the need for all the deaths, mainly Prim and Finnick. It was really hard to understand the thinking behind those two deaths. I really felt heart broken near the end  of the book, but thought that would change in the end. Very sad ending and I don't think it was necessary. I was also torn about her choice between Petta and Gale. . When it was obvious that she was going to choose Petra, Gale was totally out of the picture. Gale was such an important role in the book and when the choice is made he is gone.
