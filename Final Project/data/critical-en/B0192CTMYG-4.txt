I of course love the books themselves, but I just spent a lot of money and don't feel I got what I paid for. The audible doesn't sync up with the Kindle ebook as most others do. My kids read the Kindle version while the audible version plays and it helps with their reading skills. With the price of these versions I would expect that to be a feature. Every other children's book I have purchased has that capability. I called and asked and the people at Amazon weren't very clear on when if ever this feature would be added. Strange. If your kids like to do as mine and read along with the narrator then this version isn't for you. Also I agree with some other reviewers. I wish we had the option of buying the English version. It sounds as if it would have  been better.
