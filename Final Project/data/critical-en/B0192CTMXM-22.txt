After reading book 6 and being disappointed I had hoped book 7 would be more cohesive and illuminating. While some questions were answered many were not. I think 759 pages of rhetoric should have been sufficient to leave no doubts or questions about HP, his cohorts and the wizarding community most of those issues were not addressed. Futher more the HP series is simply an adaptation and rendition of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Horcruxes and hallows extracted directly from Tolkien. The Kings Cross chapter was especially cryptic and not later clarified and there will be no book 8 to clear up all the remaining questions.
