I highly enjoyed the first two books in the Hunger Games series. However, Mockingjay was slow, underdeveloped, and I'd go as far as to say forced. The plot was no longer centered around the fast paced, page turning events of the Games, and I think the book suffered deeply from that. On the positive side, there was some great characterization with Prim and Finnick. But then again it seemed Katniss and Peeta suffered considerably. The series as a whole was a success and it is simply a shame that it had to end on such a mediocre note.
