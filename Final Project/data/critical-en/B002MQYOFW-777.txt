This series fell within the same narrow female viewpoint offered by too many offerings in the past decade (pretty much everything that made it to some sort of series or movie offerings- ie True Blood, Twilight, etc).<br /><br />The formula applies as follows. Poor misunderstood "ugly" girl suddenly attains something approaching godhood due to her special abilities, Unfortunately, the reason she has attained such status is due to some male that she was not previously attached to in any real meaning. Love triangle develops while she dithers through several books who deserves her love, if any of them.<br /><br />Realizing this series was directed towards older teens, I asked my daughter her opinion. She felt the same. The females depicted as heroine in these series are actually fairly pathetic. They never seen to know their own minds, never seem to know how to say yes or no to a prospective lover until prospective lover saves them twenty or thirty times from their own stupidity, and even then waffle and whine for most of the current book. This, despite the fact they have been given such strong talents and gifts that should make them the envy of their society.<br /><br />The writing is fine. If you can deal with the continual whining of K about who she really loves (obviously until the extreme end, she doesn't even comprehend the meaning of what love means), you will probably love this trilogy. The environment is relatively well drawn during the first two books. Third one become an exercise in what appears to be extreme excuses to advance the plot.<br /><br />Adults curious about the series should prepare for disappointment, especially if you are a female who values feminine strengths other than the ability to survive childbirth. Fortunately, my daughter does not follow the current current of popularity and already ditched this in favor of Edding's various offering.<br /><br />Personally, I'm sorry I wasted my money on this. But, if you adored the Hunger Games and Catching Fire, this may not be a complete waste if your time. It is well written, if unforgiving trite in so many areas.
