This writer gets annoying fast. She writes in short sentences. Well, there may be depth. But honestly, with few words? Reading like this is painful. You find this review fun? Go read her book, then. Stop. Go. Stop. Go. Writing short sentences is silly. It's a rookie mistake, really. If your sentences can't sprawl, and maybe just take up one or two lines, then maybe you're not done thinking because you may not have anything interesting to say to your audience about your characters, your world, or their situation at large. If you're such an award-winning author you should really know better, Ms. Collins, unless you're trying to fill your audience with the same dread that your characters are facing.
