The book I received is in excellent condition. It doesn't appear to have ever been read, has a strong binging, and the cover is in great shape.  However, the hard cover is plain black with a red, non cloth spine and the title is not raised or embossed.  The real first edition is purple with a diamond inlaid cover and a red cloth spine.  If you just want the book to have a copy of it, this is a fine buy. If you want a real first edition, do not order from here.
