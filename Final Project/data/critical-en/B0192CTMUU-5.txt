The Kindle version is defective as some reviewers wrote (I wish I had read them before I purchased), on an iPad with Kindle app in my case.  When reading with the device held in landspace (side ways) position, the last sentence on the first column repeats at the beginning of the second column on every page.  Additionally, sections of certain sentences are missing randomly.  Oddly, this problem seems to go away when the device is held in portrait  orientation.<br /><br />I chatted with Amazon tech support, but after trying several fixes nothing helped and they are giving me a credit for the purchase.  They also told me that this version will not be available for purchase until the problem is fixed, but I still see it listed for purchase.  So, buyers beware.
