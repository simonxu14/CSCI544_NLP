I should probably confess, I doubt I'm in this books target audience. I'm male and in my twenties. That being said, I didn't much care for it.<br /><br />For starters, a book about kids killing kids isn't exactly the sort of thing I can get behind. And at it's heart, that is the core of the book. You can try to get around it by saying - well it's actually about the sort of society that would allow such a thing to happen, or some other excuse, but that isn't what's fueling the narrative. The primary source of conflict in this book is a group of kids in an enclosed area using various means to extinguish each other's lives. I have to admit, that makes me a bit squeamish.<br /><br />But putting all that aside, the book is still just not very good. From the start, we can see where this is going. Ms. Collins starts off almost immediately hyping these games, so you immediately suspect the narrator will be selected for the games or be sent to the games by some confluence of events. Then you look at the spine of the book and can determine: she won't be dying any time soon. And you get the sense this writer isn't much of a risk taker so you conclude: she won't be dying at all. You can discern all of this within the first thirty pages.<br /><br />Then there is another small problem; why should we care about our protagonist? She isn't the most exciting person in the world. Besides hunting, she doesn't seem to have many interests. The world she inhabits seems so small it could induce claustrophobia. When I think of the prospect of losing such a character, I think: that will be fine. So as a reader, I don't have much skin in the game.<br /><br />Another problem is the world Ms. Collins describes makes little sense. This is where being an adult and reading this book is really going to put a damper on your fun. There is a capital; it has thirteen districts surrounding it. One day these districts waged war on the capital. This got the capital angry, so they force citizens of these districts to have some of their children killed every year in a barbaric televised competition. Question, when the time comes to raise a military, how is this capital going to pull that off? If you were one of the citizens of these districts, you'd be getting yearly reminders of what a sick, repressive regime is running things in the capital. I don't think the whole shared sacrifice aspect of national defense will work well in their favor. No regime interested in survival would allow such games to take place.<br /><br />Everyone in this novel seems either callous or downright psychopathic. There aren't many glimmers of humanity visible. The protagonist volunteers to take the place of her sister at these games, and district 12's response is to give her a useless salute. Seems like a rebellion would have been more appropriate. Outside of the violence, there isn't much to drive this story. We limp from one dead teenager to another until we reach the predictable climax.
