These books had so much hype around them that I had to try it out. Unfortunately, I was unable to even find a way to connect with Katniss' character at all because she's simply boring. No unpredictability, just another heroine with skills above the rest. It may very well prove to be an exciting story to the younger generation, but it just reads like so many other books before it that it lacks that spark.
