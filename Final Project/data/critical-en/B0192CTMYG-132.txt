I ordered two of these books. I was quite surprised by what I received. The books are 5 x 8 inches--very small. There is no gold embossing, no leather. It is a miniature hard bound book, no special edition. Nothing special about it whatsoever...Sending mine back. Don't waste your energy; you will be deceived and sorely disappointed.
