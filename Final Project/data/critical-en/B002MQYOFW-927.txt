I think I'm the last person on the planet to read this book, and after all the hype I was REALLY skeptical (I got tricked into reading a Twilight book and I still haven't recovered). That being said, here are my thoughts:<br /><br />This is a book written for a teenage audience. It's very short, simplistic and basic. The plot line is straight forward, and the action starts quickly. There's very little in the way of prologue or character development. The characters are very basic and one dimensional, and the plot evolves in a very predictable way. For younger audiences I can see the appeal. It wastes little time with flowery language, and you're right in the thick of the action very quickly. The story develops and resolves itself in the exact way you would want it to, without any real surprises or emotional blows, and the book is done very quickly.<br /><br />It's a fast read (I was done in about 4-5 hours), and fast paced and entertaining enough to want to keep reading. It's not a classic, it's not a subtle critique of humanity or our political environment. It's just a fun story... And for that, I give it 3 stars!
