I love reading and especially series... but really I dont see what everyone sees. I got all three books and read them in less then a week. The first book was good, now amazing but kept me on my toes. The second one started out good and slowly was losing me. Then this third one..... are you kidding me. I finished it for the principle because I was hoping it would get better but it was a terrible ending. This book ruined the whole series for me. I should have known the only person I knew that read the series said the same thing about book three.... too bad I heard their review after I read it.
