This story seemed like an adolescent fantasy adventure with caricatures of people, predictable outcomes, all if which I found boring and a waste of time. I read it only because it had been the selection of my book club. I was surprised so many of the other members, all if whom are seniors, liked the book and want to read the series. Perhaps another early sugn of dementia.
