I am so glad to be able to comment on this Hunger Games trilogy! I got two of the same book! I ordered this trilogy and now can't read it until I get the FIRST book HUNGER GAMES.I have TWO of the RED book MOCKINGJAY! I have gotten back to the place who sold it to me and have not heard an answer. I have TWO of the same book and they have not addressed my concern. I wonder if they have made this same error to other customers? Not good business. I also heard that someone is selling the first part of the trilogy so I tried to do an even trade since she was finished. I as of yet have not heard from her either. I need help so I can start to read my books. For now they are just sitting on the couch waiting for the error by the store I purchased from to contact me and correct the error. I am so disappointed!!!
