After being completely spellbound by the first two books in this series, I found this one a disappointment.  The story meanders around, never really doing anything much except giving an extended background to the final showdown.  And even that wasn't written with the same panache and flair as the first two books.  It was a true bloodbath, with so many oddball happenings it was like the author had a whole bunch of macabre ideas and wanted to use them all up in a hurry before the series ended. So the first two-thirds, or thereabouts, were wishy-washy, most of the last third over-brutal, and then it all subsided into a sort of happy-ever-after. Not in the same league as the first two.
