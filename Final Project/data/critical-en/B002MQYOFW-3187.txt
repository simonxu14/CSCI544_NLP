This book sucked.  In sucking, it made the second book suck because the two books are tied together so closely.<br /><br />I think the author was unable to describe a complex storyline involving Katniss in the war and instead decided that she should spend most of the book unconcious.<br /><br />This book is bad because the great protagonist in the first book is replaced by a helpless character that wanders pointlessly for 300 pages and then is summed up in the last 30 pages.<br /><br />The whole book might as well have been this last 30 pages explaining how the war turns out without Katniss really mattering.<br /><br />The fact that Katniss is now separated from her mother is stupid too.<br /><br />What a waste of a good series.<br /><br />This author should be ashamed of herself.<br /><br />Dave
