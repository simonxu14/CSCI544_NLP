I loved the first two books in this triology, and the first half of this final edition. However, the ending just ruined the whole series for me. Its rushed, very unsatisfactory, leaves a lot unexplained, and destroys any good feelings you might have had about the characters and what they were doing. It really ruined the whole series for me. Had I known from the beginning, I probably wouldn't have let myself get emotionally invested in the plot of the first two books. This book gets two stars only because I actually liked the first half of it.
