The trilogy is relatively well-written overall. There were, however, several places where it felt as if the writer had left particular scenes in while editing out material around them, making them feel out of place or contrived. While I can't put into words exactly why this was the case, I also found myself unable to buy into some of the key relationships--something about them just seemed unbelievable to me. SPOILER ALERT: I was offended by the conclusion of the trilogy (not the epilogue) where the writer implied that Katniss and Peeta had slept together and equated this with love. I didn't feel it was in line with the characters, and it felt cheap and lazy. I definitely wouldn't bother re-reading any of the trilogy.
