Well if you have not read this by now, you probably should put it on your list if for no other reason than the much greater character development over the movie treatment. Even though clearly for teen/young adult audiences the narrative is compelling and much more dynamic. If you like a quick read with action and drama, Hunger Games has something for you. As an older reader I found it worth the time though you could smell the &#34;script treatment&#34; as you went through the book and I wondered frequently why franchise was split into 3 books other than to create sales and multiple movies.<br /><br />It bears repeating, books are much better than movies.
