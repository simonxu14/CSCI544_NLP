Hmm...what can I really say about the final book? Well, to be blunt, I didn't really like it, and before you go accusing me of hater status you should know that I did, in fact like the first novel. The second one I found to be so-so. Of course, I thought that the final book was magnificently written, great detail, and editing that smacks of sheer perfection. Unfortunately, I just couldn't get past the actual story. It was just plain disheartening to read. I think I still could've nevertheless gotten over this if hadn't been for the death of Finnick. He's a major character by this point and his demise is just so utterly pointless and well, not the least bit dramatic or heart-wrenching. It's just one line he's there, the next he isn't, the story moves on. She seems to make a half hearted attempt at redressing this near the end, but it's not enough. Overall, the book just ends up being too depressing, even with the nice, flattened ending. Oh well, just my opinion, nothing more.
