This book did not hold up to books 1 and 2 which is unfortunate. Collins was great in describing the actual games, but she seems to of lost her way in large scale war and rebellions. All in all it did wrap up the story well, but it just didn't have the excitement or depth that the first two did.<br /><br />Fortunately, I think the movie will be infinitely better as they should be able to show the battles and intensity much better than Collins could write them.
