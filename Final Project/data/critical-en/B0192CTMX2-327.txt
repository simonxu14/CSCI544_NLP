As an Amazon Prime customer, I was utterly devastated when my pre-ordered book was not at my front door on Saturday! I had to run to my local bookstore to purchase a copy.<br />I understand there were errors in delivery and my pre-ordered book did arrive later on in the week.  Thank you for the $5 gift card (which I already used) and the refund of the book.
