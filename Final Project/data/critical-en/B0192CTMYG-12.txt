I knew that the book was divided into a part 1 and a part 2, but the picture of this product clearly shows a Part 1 marking even though I ended up getting the second part, which starts at chapter 10.  Having already read the book in English, I just got it to practice my Korean with a story that I was already familiar with, so it wasn't a huge deal.  I just want to warn future customers to be careful when ordering this product, you may not get what you wanted.
