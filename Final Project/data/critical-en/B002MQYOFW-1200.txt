***CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />Hmm. I'll start with the things I did like:<br />It kept me up late nights. You just kept wanting more and more and even though I disagreed with some of the events, I still kept reading.<br />The middle of the book had me saying, "This is my favorite, by far."<br />However.<br />I just finished it about an hour ago and am still crying. Its so depressing!! Pretty much every character I loved, died. I have been Team Peeta forever, and I love that they got together, but the way she ended it with Gale did not sit well with me. The whole ending didn't sit well with me!<br />Oh, and don't even get me started with Prim.<br />Prim's death was so completely unneccesary. Hadn't all this started because of Prim?! Prim was why Katniss was fighting!!! She even said Prim was the only person she was completely certain she loved.<br />And the endings of Finnick, Madge and Cinna were just awful to me.<br />Finnick came to be a very important character, and you just have him eaten by a mutt? Whats up with that?<br />And Cinna. She never even clarified that he was dead. The last we saw of him was halfway through Catching Fire.<br />And whats up with Madge? She goes back to District 12, poof, Madge dead. Wow.<br />Also, the whole part with the Capitol being set up like an arena annoyed me. Everything seemed much more gruesome than anything we'd encountered in either of Katniss' Games.<br />When she was in P. Snow's mansion, the way she just curled up in a ball and screamed all the time, killing Pres. Coin, sitting in her old room in the Training Center, plotting ways to commit suicide, just... really didn't sit well with me.<br />And she doesn't get much of a happy ending. Why go back to District 12? Why?<br />Why in the world would Gale and her mother not come? Katniss needs them. And doesn't Gale love her? I guess he never did.<br />The ending with Peeta was very cute, but oh so bittersweet. I still don't know if Peeta fully regained his memory or not. What made her fall in love with him?<br />Although I shouldn't complain that she got to be with Peeta. After all, I've been hardcore Team Peeta from the beginning.<br />But... I don't like how it happened. I miss the old Peeta. Because since she never clarified that he got his memory back, it was like a new person falling in love with Katniss.<br />If only old Peeta knew that he would have kids with Katniss. I think new Peeta doesn't appriciate it as much, you know?<br />Finally, what are they're kids names? I know its stupid, but I really would've liked to have known.<br />This really helped get my emotions out!<br />Well, I'm sad. Because I don't think I'll be able to ever pick up any of the Hunger Games books again without bursting into tears everytime Katniss has a laugh with Madge, Finnick, Cinna, or Prim.<br />This book has left me depressed.
