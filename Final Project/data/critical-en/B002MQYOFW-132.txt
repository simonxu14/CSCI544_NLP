As I mentioned in my review for Catching Fire, Suzanne Collins clearly spent a LOT of time refining Hunger Games, and not nearly as much time refining the latter two books. It really shows painfully in the third volume, which struggles mightily to come together.<br /><br />Katniss has clearly lost her mind. She has gone through one too many traumatic experiences, and has shut down. Collins actually depicts this remarkably well, but it makes the novel difficult to read. Many of the scenes are just, well, off-kilter. Many of Katniss' decisions don't make good sense, because she doesn't have good sense. This would really work if the rest of the plot held together better. But it really doesn't.<br /><br />The primary problem, of course, is that we don't return to the arena. Really, how could she justify a third trip? So she turns the third act of the book into a weird pseudo-arena built in the streets of the Capitol. Katniss and the others must use the skills they learned in the Games to navigate a series of traps. Because, well, um, that's how the series has to go? It doesn't make a lot of sense.<br /><br />I also have to say that I was terribly, almost violently disappointed with the way the book ended. The only element I approved of was her choice between Peeta and Gale. Both her choices of which characters died and how they died was, in my opinion, terrible.
