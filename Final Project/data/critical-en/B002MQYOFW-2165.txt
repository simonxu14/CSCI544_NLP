Not quite as good as "The Hunter Games," but better than "Catching Fire." This wasn't highly anticipated by me, so I guess I would've been fine with whatever direction Collins went with it, but I was hoping for a little more payoff. And why was this book so bloody and depressing. There isn't much humor in it, leaving it feeling very one-note. Good, but you'll probably forget it once you're done reading.
