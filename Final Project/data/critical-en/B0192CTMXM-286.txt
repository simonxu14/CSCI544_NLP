This item was advertised as the Canadian version so I paid more for it. However, when I received it, it was the American version! The American version used retails for 1 cent. I think this is completely unacceptable and I am very annoyed. It is unfair to advertise these books as the more expensive editions, but then sell the cheaper editions. Don't buy from this seller!
