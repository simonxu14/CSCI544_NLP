I was very excited for this last book to come out.  I did like it, but I have to say that the very first one was my favorite. Hunger Games had me hooked throughout the whole book. The author was so creative w/ the plot and how Panem would really be. The second book, Catching Fire, was also a very good sequel.  She picked up right where Hunger Games ended. My only critique of Mockingjay was that she sort of went overboard w/ the creative juices. Some of the things that took Katniss through this final stage of rebellion just seemed like a lot of fluff to get more pages in to the book. I would have liked for there to be a little more concentration of the characters relationships to eachother. But all in all, I did like it. It was worth the read.
