The first 75% of the trilogy was a well-written page-turner. However, I think the story hit a road-block in book 3 where the history repeats itself and gets too predictive and convoluted. Somewhere in the middle of book 3 I lost interest completely and could not care less and simply stopped reading (would have thrown the book away if it wouldn't have been the Kindle version...) Too repetitive and too boring after the first two excellent books. :-(
