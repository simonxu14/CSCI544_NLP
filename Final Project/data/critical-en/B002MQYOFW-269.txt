I really like Collins writing style, she did a good job coming up with a story that hasn't been done to death a million times (as is so common in the literary world). The only think I didn't like is that the ending is a little predictable because she wrote the story in the first person. Generally speaking, the &#34;I&#34; of the story doesn't tell their story from the grave. Because of this, it was fairly easy to figure out how the story was going to turn out. If I had written the book, I would have written from an omniscient third person or switched perspectives throughout the story, that way it wouldn't be that predictable. I am looking forward to reading the other two books though :)
