If you like heroes to be heroes, always, and villians to be villains,evil and forever, read the book and don't go any further with this review, it's beyond you.  If you know that good and evil are mixed in all, keep  reading.<br />In these books, you can safely assume that good and evil will  remain separated forever.  Each character contains one and only one of the  two.  I'm not counting pre-adolescent hijinks, which the good characters  indulge in, as evil.<br />Not to contradict myself, but there are a few dark  tones in the good characters--but these seem to be because the author has  overlooked it or not had enough moral character to realize the problem.  For example, why has the headmaster permitted a certain individual to  remain unjustly accused and convicted for fifty years?  It doesn't speak  well for &quot;the greatest wizard&quot;.  This is beyond the ken of the  11-year-olds the author is shooting for, and so goes overlooked.<br />The  author plays to the prejudices of the 11 year olds.  The fat are treated  cruelly--they sit on items and break them, or have their clothes falling  down, anything for cheap laughs.  Needless to say, none of Harry's friends  are fat.<br />  The logic puzzle in the first book is useless, since the  reader cannot see the bottles--it is necessary to know the position of the  largest and smallest bottle for a full solution.  However, the reader is  not supposed to solve the puzzles in these books, I think.  In the second  book, a character's name (including the middle name, never previously  given) form an anagram of another's, PLUS THE WORDS &quot;I AM . . .  &quot;.  No way for the clever reader to solve it, he is never given all  the clues.<br />Quiddish is a nice idea.  However, the author has not been  able to come up with new ideas for the game, and in the second book, it is  mostly ignored.  Kudos to the author for coming up with the minor character  of the quiddish captain, noble but obsessed, might have come straight out  of Tom Brown's Schooldays.<br />The author might have been smarter not to try  to describe the elements of magic society in the second book.  All are  extraneous to the plot, and lend themselves to contradictions (what WERE  the consequences of the sighting of the flying cars?)  The author could  have just concluded that a pre-adolescent wouldn't see or understand much  of it, and let it go.<br />  As far as I can see, we're being set up for a  final confrontation with the Dark Side, which should please the young  readers, and a love triangle, which should bore them out of their minds.  I  hope the author makes the characters more interesting and fallible, the  villians a bit nicer, some interesting ideas, and a better editor (at one  point, &quot;ancestor&quot; is used where &quot;descendant&quot; is  meant).<br />  By the way, shouldn't these kids learn a little algebra and so  forth at Hogwarts?  Not to mention sex ed!<br /> g
