I liked the first two books a lot. I think they were great reads, but this third book leave something to be desired.<br /><br />The first issue is that time just jumps constantly, there's little detail in a lot of things and the book will simply tell you that Katniss did such and such for a few weeks and then something happened. In the first two books almost every single day is detailed. You feel as if you can almost tell people hour by hour what happens. Third book time just jumps there little to no story given for these jumps just forced time progression.<br /><br />The largest issues over all is this. The second book on my Kindle is 391 pages with great format and spacing. The third book is 390 pages, but here's the thing. Every sentence is double spaced. The book by content is half that of the second one. It's a trick high school students use to meet page counts. If you can just look at the samples I'm sure they can show what I mean.<br /><br />Third book is decent but I feel like I'm missing half the book.
