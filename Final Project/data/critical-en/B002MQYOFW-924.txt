The first book was great, the second even better. The writer made me fell in love with Katniss and Peeta and everyone else... And then she wrote the third part... She changed the emotional playing field, which is never a good thing to do. It was no longer a love story, a story of a girl trying to survive in the games, trying to save Peeta... It became a war story and a very very dark one at that. I can't image they can make a good movie out of it, let alone two!<br />How much I loved book 1 and 2, so disappointed I was with book 3...<br />There isn't even an satisfying ending between Katniss and Gale...
