After the huge Hunger Games hype, I expected this to blow my mind. It didn't. I forced myslef to finish this book, hoping the end would be a complete twist-turn that would have made me believe it was worth it, it unfortunately wasn't.<br /><br />If you're not 16, or don't enjoy teenage novels or sparkly vampires, I'd say skip this series.
