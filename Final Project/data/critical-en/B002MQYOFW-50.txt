Minor spoilers here<br /><br />First off, I want to say that I loved the first two books in this series and read Mockingjay the day it came out.  I've read both The Hunger Games and Catching Fire multiple times but I can say fairly definitively that there is nothing that will lead me to read Mockingjay again.<br /><br />I was completely disappointed with the book.  There was no captivating story and nothing that kept me page turning except my desire to get to the end and see what happens to Katniss and her friends.  I practically raced through the book as it just did not hold my interest.<br /><br />There were far too many battle scenes and I felt like each one was just another was to introduce a new booby trap or muttation.  The final battle scenes in the Capitol felt like a poor attempt to parallel the arenas in the Hunger Games.  I found it a little ridiculous that the entire city was booby trapped with an infinite number of gruesome "pods."  What's wrong with just blowing someone up if you are trying to protect your home base - oh yes, that wouldn't be interesting enough for the book.<br /><br />The major deaths in the book didn't even phase me; I found them to be too rushed.<br /><br />There were no big reveals that weren't obvious and the ending was pretty much the only way to end the book.<br /><br />Katniss also just floated through the book and rarely made her own decisions or thought for herself.  I didn't get the closure for her character that I was expecting, even in the epilogue.<br /><br />I think what upset me the most is that there were no big moments of triumph that you would expect in a series conclusion like this.  There was literally nothing to cheer for in the entire book.  I suppose that is the point Suzanne Collins is trying to make about war, but it makes for a dull, depressing and not entertaining read.<br /><br />Overall, a very disappointing end to what started out as a great series.
