I loved the first two books and really looked forward to reading the last one.  When I finally read it, I thought it was a bit ho-hum due to the endless sections of Catniss' thinking inside her head about all that was happening around her.  What was this person thinking (which turned out not to be true)  and why did so-and-so behave the way they did.  It came across to me as a very immature person, rather than a 18 or 19 year old, as she was supposed to be in the third book.
