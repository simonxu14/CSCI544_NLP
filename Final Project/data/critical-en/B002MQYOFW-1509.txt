Like most of the reviewers I loved "The Hunger Games" and "Catching Fire".  There was violent content but I thought it was handled appropriately with the storyline, making the books suitable for older teens on through adults (I am 50+).  Both of the prior books gave the reader a heroine to root for and very likeable characters.  The plot was the most intriguing and unique to come along in years.<br /><br />But then comes "Mockingjay" and the whole tone of the story becomes extremely dark, there is MUCH more violence, and most of the characters are destroyed, either psychologically or physically, or both.  Our heroine becomes a puppet at everyone else's beck and call and most of the characters seem to have had mind transplants (figuratively), turning them into almost unrecognizable characters from the first two books.<br /><br />Because of "Mockingjay", I would not consider this trilogy to be appropriate for young teens or adolescents.  And because of the negative impact of this book, I would seriously consider who I would recommend the trilogy to.  This is such a shame because I recommended the first two books to all ages of friends, relatives, and acquaintances.  I even sent all three books to my granddaughter and really regret sending "Mockingjay" before I had read it myself.  She is 17 but has a soft heart.  This book devastated her.  This book is dark, depressing and devastating.  In other post-apocalyptic novels I have read, I have expected this or at least considered that this might be a possibility.  I did not expect it after reading the first two books, which were full of hope, and I did not expect it, especially to this degree in a book published as a YA book.<br /><br />I wish that this book had followed in the same vein as the prior two.  The trilogy would have become one of my favorite reads of all time.
