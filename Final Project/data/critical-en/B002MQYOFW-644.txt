While this book completes the Hunger Games trilogy, it unfortunately seems the author was rushed to finish. A great book, up until the last 6 chapters, where the authors writing style completely changes. This is one of the few books that I'm frustrated after reading, both because of the story's ending, as well as the difference in the author.
