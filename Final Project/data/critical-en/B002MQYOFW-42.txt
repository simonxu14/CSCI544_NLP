Horribly depressing and overdrawn inner monologue for Katniss. Perhaps the reality Haymitch kept expressing is true. The games never end. Even when she is married to her love Peeta and has two kids, there  is no real joy present. But like she said some 15 years has passed and for her to seem so despondent makes it appear that the games and Snow have actually won.<br /><br />But let me back up.  It's odd to see a book take soooo long to conclude and then when the climax hits, she is withdrawn from the action.  Is she shellshocked? I mean I get it.  Everything she fought for is taken from her. 12 is gone, gale is apparently abhorrent to her (since he makes weapons? Get over it), Peeta is hijacked, the arena is gone, haymitch betrayed her trust.. Blah blah. So what makes Katniss fight? Because she doesn't seem to fight for herself anymore. She is all done saving people. So it at the end she finally gets a reason to live because Peeta shows back up? then TELL US ABOUT  IT! For the author to belabor the point the entire book to-I'm done. What is the point of writing a trilogy then? To tell us there is no hope? Even what you fight for isn't going to make you better or happier?  I get that war is ugly but at some point, grieve, get help and move on somehow. This book is the antithesis of what makes people root for Katniss. Instead of seeing a kid that is sappy, into fashion, trying to get laid, she is strong and fierce. Very anticlimactic and frustrating.<br /><br />I wish I never read this and I hope that the filmmakers give us some reason to get excited about it. Like change the plot entirely and give us an ending that doesn't allow Snow to win.
