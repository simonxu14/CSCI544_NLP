I am not into really graphic violence, and I found book one to have just the amount that was acceptable in my estimation, but books two and three seemed to increase the violence almost exponentially, and I am hoping not to have nightmares myself. If I, at 67, find it disturbingly graphic (albeit fascinating), I hate to think of my impressionable preteen granddaughter reading the horrific details. Kids are too desensitized  to violence already. I'd like to erase it off her Kindle if I could.
