I love the first two books in this series, but Mockingjay does not live up to the promise of the first two instalments.  It is slow and boring, and at times it is hard to read.  The worst part of the book is that I wound up disliking Katniss.  The main character came off looking flaky and silly throughout the book.  She did show some strength at the end, and the ending is really the only saving grace for a very tedious book.
