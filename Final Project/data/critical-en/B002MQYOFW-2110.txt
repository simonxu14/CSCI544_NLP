Am disappointed I purchased this book. I only read the third one because I saw the movies. The movies are so much better, and wish I had waited for the third movie. Aside from the fact that the writing is poor it is utterly incredulous how any person with all her mental and physical impairments could function and perform in the manner Katniss did/does. The ending in the third book was incredibly disappointing because it didn't explain the truth and/or lies Snow related to Katniss. So basically readers are left hanging. Hopefully when the storyline is rewritten for the third movie it will include what is missing from the book. My advise... don't read the books, see the movies, they are so much better!
