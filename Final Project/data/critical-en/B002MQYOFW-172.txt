I finished this book, which I don't always do. Fortunately, I only paid $3.99 to download it onto my phone. I'm sure I won't read the two sequels. I suppose in fairness, it was written for young people, which I'm not. However, I cannot understand for the life of me how this book has remained at the top of the best seller list for so long. It's average at best. The author spends a huge amount of time describing every morsel that the main character puts into her mouth throughout the story, yet apparently never had to go to the toilet the entire time she was living in caves and trees. I always get a kick out of the writings of people about living in the wild who have apparently never actually spent much time living in the wild. She writes about land mines, with obviously no clue as to how land mines actually operate. I guess if you're writing for a ten year old, that's fine, but if you're an adult, forget this book.
