I read this book after reading the first two. I just had to know how the story would finish! But then about 1/4 of the was through, it started to become sloppy with respect to the story. It made reading it a painful chore. At the end it felt rushed. The ending was inadequate and unenjoyable. Possibly the biggest anticlimactic piece of writing when you consider the first 2 books.
