First of all, I LOVED the first book. The second book I thought was good - not great.<br /><br />I started reading the 3rd book immediately after finishing the 2nd book.<br /><br />Honestly, I was so bored out of my mind that I started skipping bits.<br /><br />Most of the time Katniss is either: drugged up, in hospital, crying in a corner, or being told what to do. She loses all of her personality, and I really came to dislike her. in the end she was nothing more than a complete psychopath.<br /><br />The only thing that kept me reading was to find out whether she hooked up with Peeta or Gale. And I was utterly disappointed on that front too! It is added at the end of the book, like an afterthought, as if the author wanted to finish the book as soon as possible.<br /><br />I am so repelled by this book, so disappointed, and sad about it. Nothing in it was original. It was bombs, and death left right and center. I felt no emotion for any of the characters, and didn't care who died. The book was hollow, empty. It had no soul.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't even think there needed to be a second or third book. Collins could have fit the entire story into one 500 page novel if she took out most of the useless drivel. Useless things like; being pretty, having your makeup done, different foods, acting for the camera.<br /><br />This whole novel was just fake fake fake fake. Utter rubbish.<br />I guess it's my own fault for having such high hopes after the first book.<br /><br />honestly though, I think this trilogy would make a much better movie than book.
