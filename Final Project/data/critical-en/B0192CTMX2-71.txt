While my family and I spent a great deal of time reading this latest edition I must admit it was tooooo long.  Come on editors please do your job.  The plot was too tangled, Harry's character was too self involved, and come on the only quiddich game went on forever.  How many versus of Ron is our king did we need to read!  I believe that Rowling needs to remember that her main readers are children and many will not stick with the book to finish it.  I hope the next book is better and more concise.
