I would like to start off by stating The Hunger Games was an awesome book. With that being said, I would like to state that Catching Fire was one of the BEST books I have ever read. So what does that leave me thinking? That with the arrival of Mockingjay, and the pattern I have picked up on means that I will get to read one of the best books ever written...this was definitely not the case.<br /><br />I am disappointed because Mockingjay does not provide a substantial ending to the climax built by its successors. Why, you ask. Because of the following reasons (there are no spoilers):<br /><br />1.) Katniss is not Katniss in the third book. She is not the tough tribute, who underneath all her rage really has a big heart. She is not the "fighting for the right reasons" girl we came to know and love.<br /><br />2.) Mockingjay is an entirely different book than the previous two. Mockingjay is a book about war. Pure, unemotional accounts of war. If you're into that, it will be a great read.<br /><br />3.) The ending was awful. Sure, no one was expecting the ending to be completely happy. But after all the author puts you through, the ending makes you feel as if the rebellion wasn't worth the trouble. Bring back the capitol, the separated districts- even the hunger games for crying out loud! Because I felt that everyone was much happier then.<br /><br />To be honest I read the previous two books in less than a week each. This one took me much longer. That says enough on its own, for me.<br /><br />So I repeat Ms. Collins, we promise to forgive you, but please write us a new ending to your trilogy!!!
