SPOILER ALERT*******I loved The Hunger Games. I thought it was genius. Not just because of its originality, but because in the midst of a horrific &#34;game&#34; Collins was make us focus on loving relationships rather than the blood sport. Catching Fire also let the relationships lead our interest. The problem I had with Mockingjay is that instead of making us feel for the people being torn from one another, it makes us spectators in the horror. I felt as complicit in the violence as a viewer in the capitol watching the games because the violence was presented as part of the entertainment for us, the readers of this book. Collins lost the restraint she masterfully displayed in the first two books. The spark of connection between the characters which makes the loss of life matter is lost in this book. There is only isolation in a lost, dark world of horrors. The violence is so drawn out and over the top in the Capitol District that the arena seems a safe place in comparison. I found it utterly ridiculous that the Capitol could have an entire city rigged beyond the level they had rigged the arena. This book seems to veer off course about a third of the way in and become a work of pure horror. I understand the themes of war and power are the cornerstone of this series, but when the characters take a backseat to those themes, they fail to matter anymore. Another reviewer made the comment that Peeta all but disappears in this book. I completely agree, and his loss leaves an un-fillable void. The ending is more bitter than sweet. It fails to give closure to relationships which once drove Katniss to action. Gale and Katniss' mother just fall off away with little explanation, seeming to feel no need to even be part of her life anymore. And what should be a glorious ending feels like a consolation prize. Very disappointing.
