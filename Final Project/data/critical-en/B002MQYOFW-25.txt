*SPOILER ALERT*<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br /><br />-Characters turned into unforgiving adults. The personalities went from intelligent, compassionate, resilient young adults to Navy Seal PTSD. I realize this is a war-time book but it completely shattered the story for me. I finished the book depressed and hopeless despite her lame attempt at an epilogue.<br /><br />-To many characters were introduced to die. I feel like Collins introduced a lot of characters for the sole purpose of attaching the audience and then killing them off in the name of WAR. This was not her style and it made me feel numb the longer I read.<br /><br />-The creativity and passion that I could sense at the beginning of the book with the Quarter Quell and the twist and turns that made the games exciting did not continue. At a point in the book I started getting upset because you knew something bad was going to happen every chapter.<br /><br />-Everdeen turned into a shell of her former character much like I said earlier. She was selfish, emotional, and most of the time on drugs in a hospital bed or posing for a camera. I didn't feel attached or even sorry for her this book. Just annoyed.<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />-The Games at the beginning of the book really took off well. I loved the creativity she put into getting the victors back in the Games without making it seem like a repeat.<br /><br />-The "Real or Not Real" was cool. I'm glad that they tried to humanize Peeta, despite crushing his character to pieces early on.<br /><br />In Conclusion- I just wanted to read a book that made me hopeful or encouraged. I did not expect such a morbid ending to such a well-written series. I realize most people find this bittersweet conclusion very witty and realistic but I just found it anachronistic to the character's personalities and a little unwholesome.
