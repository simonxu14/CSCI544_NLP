I loved the first two books, so I was eager to read the final book. It was okay. It was kind of a mixture of boring and depressing. And she killed one of my favourite characters, but I'll ignore that. I think it will translate better into a movie. I probably won't re-read the last book. Just not as good. I mean, it's a realistic ending I suppose.
