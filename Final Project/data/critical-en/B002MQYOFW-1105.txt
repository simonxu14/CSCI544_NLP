This book is good read, worthy of a look by anyone (adult or youth). There were some silly issues I had with the plot that made some characters unbelievable.  (My biggest issue was that the Government seems all powerful / omniscient one moment and then wishy-washy / ignorant the next.)  Overall, still worth reading if only to get the Authors version before seeing the movie.
