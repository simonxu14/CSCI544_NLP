I thought it was quite good but frankly I have seen this story before. Think of "Running Man" or "Logan's Run" or "The Island" (a remake of Logan's run really) with bits from "1984" and "Brave New World" added in to the mix. The main difference here (and the most disturbing part of the society depicted) is that the people doing the dying are children.<br /><br />For me, only 3-stars given I have seen this story before as I mentioned above. Few new twists here beyond the kids really.
