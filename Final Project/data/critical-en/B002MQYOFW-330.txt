The story grabs you right from the beginning and all the way through EXCEPT for the end. It was disappointing to me. I was hoping to &#34;feel good&#34; at the end, but alas, I was not... It left the other books a &#34;wish I hadn't read them&#34; feeling. Sad, so sad...<br /><br />There was a little satisfaction in what she did at the end, but it left me feeling empty like an unfinished story...
