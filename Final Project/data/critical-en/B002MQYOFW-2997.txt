Collins paints a nice picture of a desolate world, but there's about there things ended for me.  I was not a fan of the whole premise of the book. I really don't want to say much without stating spoilers.  People have told me you must read the other books to understand. Why? Why do I need to read the next books in the series to understand the first?  That doesn't make sense.<br /><br />There were some good highlights in the book, I mean some parts where I could not put it down at night to see where it was going.  I guess I was just looking for more.  Some parts of the book felt very amateurish, which was a turn off.
