Needless to say, The Hunger Games, as a story, totally can suck you in. It has the romantic angst to appeal to girls and young women and the sci-fi elements and violence to appeal to guys. It also has a very topical political angle. The problem was with the digital edition itself: it would not remember where my bookmark was and each time I went to read it, I had to manually find where I last left off reading it. There are no page numbers, only a "location number," so I had to use a Note app to write down the location number every time I stopped reading so that I could find that page later. It was extremely annoying. But I loved the books, especially the final one.
