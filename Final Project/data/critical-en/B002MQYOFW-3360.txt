This book is terrible - teens killing teens! And, written and designed for teens.  Put what ever political, philosophic, literary, futuristic, "Occupy", "Lord of the Flies", "1984" spin on it you wish, but we adults would have been better off without this book, to say nothing about our young.  The real tragedy of this book/movie is that it was written/sold/hyped/distributed/made a "must read" by adults only trying to make lots of money, not caring one whit what effect it would have on young minds trying to make some sense of this crazy world.  But, that is really not the job of the "market" is it?<br />  I am surprised that it was not entitled "The Columbine Games", but that name was probably already taken!
