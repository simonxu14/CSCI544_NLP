Not quite sure what has happened with the publishing of this particular set however, the first book was missing pages 154 through 187 and there were duplicate pages in the same book.  I bought this Trilogy as a gift for my son.  He says he will write to the publisher to have &#34;catching fire&#34; replaced.  (that was the one with the messed up/missing/and duplicate pages.
