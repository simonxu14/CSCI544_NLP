I think this is a great trilogy and has a great final book until the ending. The other books ending were great  but this might just be me but (Spoiler Alert!) Katniss should have ended up with Gale. Also somehow I don't think Katniss wouldn't (Spoiler Alert!) have a problem telling her kids about the Capitol. I would recommend reading the other books first, as I would have not gotten anything that was happening and why.
