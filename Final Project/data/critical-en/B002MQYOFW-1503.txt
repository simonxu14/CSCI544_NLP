This series has a special place in my heart. The first two are beautifully written, making the reader laugh, cry, and even love with Katniss. In anticipation for the final book of the Hunger Games, I was hoping for closure, and a sense of peace. However, Collins left me with confusion and anger. I have always thought of Katniss as an unstoppable force, a rock in which her friends and family rely on. But, with the exception of a few pages, Katniss was a disappointment. She lacked the "fire" within her that was so prevalent in the first two books. I feel like Mockingjay was missing the spunk we saw in the Hunger Games and Catching Fire. When I finished this book, I sat, trying to figure out what this book was missing. I cannot put my finger on exactly what it was missing, but I can tell you, as the final book of the Hunger Games, it was an absolute disappointment.
