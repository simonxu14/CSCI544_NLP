I didn't know what to expect but it wasn't this. It wasn't bad but I felt a little deflated by the ending. It seemed to move too quickly, the flow was confusing and for the first time Katniss irritated me. But, she is a teenage girl. If you read the first two, obviously you have to read this one too, but proceed with caution.
