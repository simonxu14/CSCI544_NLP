I don't know what to say to folks reading this other than "lower your expectations." If you've read the first two books (as I'd assume you had if you're picking up the third) you've been introduced to well written characters and engaging story-lines. In the third you have a taste that more may come only to be forced to wrestle through congested plots and expedient situations that produce chaotic conclusions.<br /><br />I felt that through the latter half of the book Ms. Collins must have been rushed or coerced to finish the book (perhaps both). It pains me to write a review like this because I and my family truly admire her work; her books have a special place on our shelves along with the likes of C. S. Lewis, Lois Lowry, Katherine Paterson, Madeleine L'Engle  and E. B. White. But even great writers can have a bad outing and to me this is. I met few who've read it that believe that this concluded the series well and too many that were dismayed.<br /><br />Lower your expectations and this book may surpass them. It's still a visit into the lives of some great characters/cultures - just not as good as it could have been.
