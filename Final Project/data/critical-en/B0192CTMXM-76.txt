I read some previous Potters, but was not familar with all of the named characters. A cast of characters would have helped. Also, with so many kinds of creatures a description would have helped. With the early Potters I didn't want them to be over, but here I was impatient to reach the end. I must admit I was caught in the adventure in the end. But alas there wiil be no more.
