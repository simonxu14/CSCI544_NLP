I bought this book on my Kindle because of all the hype over the movie and some positive reviews I had read.  But when I got into the book, I found the plot simple and the characters not really developed all that well.  I can see how this book would appeal to a young pre-teen girl, but not for mature readers.  I thought it was just a waste of time and money.
