I get that the author obviously wanted to create drama and not have a total fairy tale ending, but to have the main character who's supposed to have been so strong through the trilogy be so destroyed as to barely be able to live out her life as a completely broken individual after fighting so hard through the rest of the books. She basically had her give up once they'd won the war. Crumby, lousy ending to what had been a really great series. Very disappointed!
