Basically, I think the first in the series, The Hunger Games, is the only one really worth reading. The subsequent books add nothing of value and, to me, feel forced. They are increasingly devoid of credibility, as well as suffering from the moroseness of the main character. There is no character development through the series, and the imaginative evolution of the technology I found boring.
