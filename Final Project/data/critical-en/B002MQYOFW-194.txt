I was never looking for a happily ever after, I don't mind reading sad and depressing books. The thing that bothered me about the last book is that it was anticlimactic, the book was filled with the war promo filler and Katniss's haunting memories and guilt. I got that, war is traumatic..the games are traumatic but page after page after page? Just seems like filler to me. Like the author didn't even really know what direction exactly she was taking. You knew from the very beginning that Katniss wouldn't choose Gale because of the lack of character interaction. It was extremely predictable. Speaking of character interaction, I was enraged by the lack of ALL character interaction, like another reviewer had said, the characters all took on a paper doll feeling to them. Primrose death was just thrown in to solidify that Katniss could never be with Gale because of the correlation between the bomb that Gale helped make and Prims death. Seems cheap. This would be a one star book if the previous books had not been so good.
