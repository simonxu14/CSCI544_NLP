It took me a while before I finally read this trilogy simply because the idea of kids being forced to kill other kids is distastful and hard to stomach.  I find it hard to believe that we are allowing and even hyping this story to kids and teens.<br />Suzanne Collins is a great story teller in that her writing is easy to read and the story flows very well...except in the third book where you find yourself wondering if someone else wrote it.  The story line takes very strange turns and the final chapters are more summaries than story.  All in all- an okay story with a difficult topic.
