I was told by a teacher that I needed to read this series, I was so disappointed with it.  There really isn't much that happens to keep me involved, people/kids get picked to kill each other, the end!!!  So I thought I would stick with it anyway, and am now half way through the second book, it's the same exact story as the first book, even with the same people going in to kill each other. SERIOUSLY!!  I will not read the third book, this was such a waste of money.  How did this ever become a movie?
