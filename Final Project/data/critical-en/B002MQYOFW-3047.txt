For three of four years now, people have been telling me to read this book, and I always told them I might. But once I saw the movie trailer (which was amazing), I decided to finally read The Hunger Games. Too bad everything everyone told me about this book is extremely false, and makes me wonder about my friends' intelligence.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Very interesting story idea<br />-Imaginative world<br />-Decent character development<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Written in first person, so it automatically creates two flaws: 1. Obviously the main character will survive, because she's telling the story. So if she dies, the book would just end. 2. There are so many interesting things happening in the arena, but we can't see them because its told from one person's point of view, and unfortunately, this person, Katniss, is not doing anything all that interesting.<br />-Written horribly. This is the only Suzanne Collins book I can remember reading, so I don't know if she is always a bad writer, or if its just with this book, but the writing was so awful, I just wanted to throw my Kindle against the wall. This "book" feels more like a rough draft. Everything seemed like the beginning of an idea, not a fully thought-out story.<br />-The story seemed like it should play out like an action story, but turns out to be a really awkward and uncomfortable love story.<br />-All the main character does is whine<br />-The premise of the story makes you think there will be a lot of action, but it is all avoided in very cheap ways. (Spoiler alert): When you think Katniss is going to have to kill Peeta, a voice comes over the speakers announcing a rule change that says they can both live if they're the last two standing. It completely eliminated the main conflict and the most suspenseful and interesting part of the story. Also, at the end, when you think they're about to have an epic battle with Cato, these things called "Mutts" come and take care of Cato for them (basically). Oh yeah, and the Mutts were weird and kind of stupid.<br />-Bad ending.<br /><br />Overall:<br />Unless you really want to read the book before you see the movie, go for it. But if you don't really want to waste your money, I'd say just wait for the movie. Just the trailer alone is better than this book.<br /><br />To all you strong followers of this book:<br />Before you start posting hate comments like crazy, or get your feelings hurt over this review, I want you to know that its just one person's opinion. If you love this book, so be it. But your life isn't ruined because of it.
