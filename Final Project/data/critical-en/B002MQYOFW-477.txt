Mockingjay is by far the worst book in The Hunger Game series, however for fans of the first two books it is a must read in order to get a sense of resolution and closure for the characters and story lines. To a certain extent, it seems as though Suzanne Collins gave up in writing this book. The focus seems to have become almost entirely political and action sequences and character development that were present and enjoyable in the first two books seem to be left to the wayside in this one. While it would seem superfluous to describe a book where issue one of the series focuses on children being forced to murder each other as "dark," there seems to be quite a lack of silver lining moments in Mockingjay.<br /><br />On the plus side, we do see solid, if a bit rushed, resolutions for the characters that we have come to love and hate over the first two books, as well as an answer to who has Katniss's heart.
