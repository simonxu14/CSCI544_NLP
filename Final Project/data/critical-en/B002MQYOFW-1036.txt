I feel this last book was drawn out with the combat parts, but then it just felt like the end result was rushed. It seemed as if Ms. Collins got tired of the story and wanted it to be finished. I think so much more should have been wrote about the different relationships/characters. I was left feeling disappointed and short changed. The overall idea of the story is excellent, but could have been written with more depth.
