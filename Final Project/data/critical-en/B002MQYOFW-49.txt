**Spoilers**<br /><br />I want to start out by saying that I loved the first and second books; I simply couldn't put them down and they were written very well that really brought you closer to the characters.<br /><br />After seeing what Katniss and Peta had gone through, the thing that was pulling me through the last book was to see if they ended up together.  The fact that they did was the only reason this book is getting 3 stars instead of 1.  So, here are my gripes:<br /><br />Prim and Finnick - what happened?  I get that it is war and people die, but there was no emotion in their deaths.  I litterly cried when Rue died in the first book (only time I have ever cried from a book) and when these two characters bit the dust . . . nothing.  Collins did not do them justice with their deaths and didn't make the readers feel the pain.  Their deaths were not tragedies, only how it was written.<br /><br />Peta - OK, I get that he had been hijacked, but he played such a small role in this book and I felt that Katniss neglected him when he was the victim.  She should have played a bigger role in his recovery and I think there were a lot of missed opportunities to see him fall back in love with her, but it just seemed to have happened with no growth visible to the reader.<br /><br />Katniss - I hated her by the end of the book.  I hated the decisions that she was making and she turned from a very likable and relatable character to someone that I hated.  Not just with what she did to Peta during his recovery, but her decision to keep the Hunger Games going when it came to a vote in the end.  She voted to continue the very thing that she was trying to stop.  How is it justice for kids to pay for the crimes of their parents/grandparents?  If you have become the very thing you are trying to destroy, then WHAT'S THE POINT!?  And what about when she killed Coin?  She didn't even accuse her, just assassinated her without any charges or trial.  Rebelion is one thing, but this was something far different.<br /><br />I really hope that the first and second movies stick to the books but I hope that the writers for the third movie just throw this book out . . . but I know that won't happen.
