I was very disappointed with this trilogy which quickly evaporated to a weak storyline,  and I got the impression that the author was clutching at straws in determining how to exact an appropriate ending for Katniss Everdeen.  Mostly predictable throughout the book and lacked a lot of new material, effectively continuing on from 'catching fire'.
