I don't know what all the hype is about. This story was disappointing.  I kept reading just to see if the plot might get better. Most of the "games" part was quite boring and only one situation at the end of the games might be seem gory to a young person. I think this book would appeal more to 7th - highschool students. Not for the mature reader.
