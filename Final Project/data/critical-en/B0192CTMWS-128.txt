I have never, in my entire life, read a book in two days.  This is due, mostly, to my immense love for books, and how I like to devour them slowly and taste every line.  However, I have now broken this trend.<br /><br />And the one word that is singing in my head?  Disappointment.<br /><br />The first chapter felt bizarrely like fanfiction, of which I've read little, but of which does have a very distinct "feel" to it.  But as I continued reading, I realized, with a jolt, that this was not fanfiction.  (...)<br /><br />(...)  I must pause in these thoughts to say that I felt about this book the same way that I felt about the Order of the Phoenix film - it was BIZARRE.  There were just many things that didn't feel right.  And the book was very unlike the J.K. Rowling that I've known in the past.<br /><br />Oh, backtracking, (...)  Perhaps Jo should have written eight books, because everything was just too rushed and she couldn't give it the attention and detail and emotion that it deserved, and this bled through the entire novel.  NO other Harry Potter book has felt this way.  Cry.<br /><br />Of course, I should clarify that I did, indeed, enjoy the book.  How could I not?  This series has touched me like nothing else has in my life, unless you count Hanson, and I do.  So, yes, I liked the book.  I loved the book.  But I think my love for it is entirely based on Snape-like loyalty, because when I look at it from my faint objective standpoint, it is very flawed.  And I enjoyed it far less than I expected to enjoy it.<br /><br />All of this new stuff about Dumbledore was great, and I loved seeing how very imperfect and infallible he was.  He was human, just like the rest of us, and like Sirius said, there was light and dark inside of him.  At first, it scared me, because I was like, "Okay, if Jo has all of these previous questions to answer, why is she giving herself new questions to answer?"  It turns out that she answered her new questions superbly, but in effect, her old ones fell by the wayside.  Apparently, she does not spend enough time on the Lexicon, run by the brilliant and lovely Steve Vander Ark.<br /><br />(...)<br /><br />(...) She is still brilliant and wonderful, and I worship at her feet every time I read her battle scenes, because they are superb and something I'm quite rubbish at, myself.  And the woman's imagination is paralleled only by those who have gone before her, like the beloved Tolkien, Lewis, and Carroll.  And perhaps some current authors, like Anne Rice, though she's gone "gaga," I hear.<br /><br />(...)<br /><br />Perhaps she didn't want to be predictable, and that's why she copped out on a lot of things?<br /><br />I do still love her.  I promise.  Loads more than I love David Yutz, anyway.<br /><br />(...)<br />I am infuriated!  And distraught.  Absolutely fantastically distraught.<br /><br />Sigh.  (...)  Jo must not realize that Snape is one of the greatest literary characters of our time.  He was brilliantly created by her, enigmatic and complicated and dynamic.  I have always loved him for this.  (...)  Once again, she didn't do herself justice, and she didn't do her fans justice, and she didn't do her spectacular character justice.<br /><br />(...)<br />The battle at Hogwarts was nothing short of magnificent.  This was always Jo's forte.  I enjoyed every minute of it, my heart pounding, my hands sweating (perhaps from holding up a fifty pound book for hours), my body fidgeting.  (...)<br /><br />This was my main problem with the Epilogue.  The crappiest Epilogue ever known to man, by the way.  (...)  Barf-inducing.  Really.  Gag me with a spoon.  But Jo was never good at romantic relationships, so I was pleased to see very little of that in this book.  But what a disgusting ending.  So unbelievably cheesy and beneath the series as a whole.  I just wanted so much more, and that's the tagline, isn't it?  I WANT MORE!<br /><br />I expected to bawl my eyes out when I closed Deathly Hallows.  I didn't, and I don't know why.  Something inside of me is definitely devastated, broken.  Yet... I found the book anti-climactic and unsatisfying.  I want Version 2.0.  And I think, for me, this is a good thing, because it helps soften the sense of loss.  I was so terrified of reading this book, thinking I'd be entirely inconsolable, with all of my questions answered.  Instead, I still have questions, and I'm still downright starving.<br /><br />I suspect Nargles are behind it.
