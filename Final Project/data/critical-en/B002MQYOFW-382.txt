I didn't fall in love with the first book like everyone else seemed to, but I really liked Peeta and wanted to see how things played out for him. The book didn't really give me that sense of knowing. I felt let down by the ending. For all I had to get through to get to the ending, it was pathetic. This book felt like the writer wasn't sure what story she wanted to tell and was just writing because she wasn't sure how to end it. The book dragged along and then just kind of fell of an edge abruptly. I wasn't expecting happily ever after but this was just not good.
