After waiting a year and finally getting the book into my hands, I expected to devour it. Sadly I never even found the book interesting. In my opinion it would have been better to extend "Catching Fire" and wrapped things up at the end of it.<br /><br />Perhaps the tone was a metaphor to depict the way people are worn down by a long drawn out war...that's the way it read...sluggish, worn out....barely able to move.  If I were Gale I would have moved away too!
