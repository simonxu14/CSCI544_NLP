Really? Compared to everything else out there, this book just isn't that great. Granted I'm not in second grade but there are so many better stories and way better writers. If it keeps your kids reading - great. But if they really want good books you should be steering them to better books.<br /><br />If the Never-ending Story and the Phantom Tollbooth are 5's this book is not even close.
