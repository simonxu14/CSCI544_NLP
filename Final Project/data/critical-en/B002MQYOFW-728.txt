I just feel like katniss lost the strength and spark of that strong, sophisticated character all readers saw in the first two books... the end was happy, bug katniss felt bland in the last few chapters.  With the action over, her sister gone, and everything settled but a few sad events, she seemed gloomy and empty.  I expected her to be sad with her sister dead.  But then again, in the previous books, all fans watched katniss stay tough through all the hardships shes been through.  I agree with those who say shelost her strentgh.  But peeta is the onewho has not lost hos character through the whole series.<br /><br />Good side is how the action flows through, and how the eve ts wrap up with feelings and aftermath.  The way the story is told with emotions and how it makes you feel the same way the characters feel, it seems realistic and well written.  I wish she could make a book ln katnisss life with peeta and children and the new events.  I will miss this series.<br /><br />Summary:  i expected moreof katniss,  but the book is classic hunger games, even if the two first ones are more lively and better than.  This one.<br /><br />(If the spelling is bad its because its hard to type o. A kindle fire.)
