This is a great book for both pokemon experts and beginners. It includes descriptions, how to pronounce each name, and pictures of each and what they evolve to.  My six year old got into the cards last year and I figured this guide would be a good way for me to learn more about Pokemon.  I knew nothing. The book is a great guide.  But, after a few days, the pages started  falling out.  The binding is some type of cheap glue or adhesive and the book fell nearly completely apart in just a few days.  If the binding could be done better, this would be a five star purchase for sure.
