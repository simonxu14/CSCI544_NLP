After hearing the hype about this series since it first came out, and after all the movies are finally done being made, I decided to at last give this book a chance.  I don't get what all the hype is about honestly.  Nothing that great or exciting happening in this book. I'm an adult, but I still love reading C.S. Lewis' The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe series.  This book, on the other hand, doesn't come close.  MAYBE I'll try reading the next book, I have been told the series grows up with the reader, so maybe the later books will be a little more relate-able.
