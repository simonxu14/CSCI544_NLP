Purchased the audio book for my husband for christmas. He listened to it around the end of Jan.(doesnt care to read the book but will listen going back and forth to work but likes the movies) and was left lacking because it contained two of disc 5 and no disc 7(the ending). I have emailed Listening Library but they have never responed to my request to get the 7th disc. I am dissapointed with their customer service.
