No spoilers here! I feel that perhaps I must have read a different book that the rest of the rave reviews.  I liked the book.  I thought the conclusion was fantastic and that Rowling did a magnificent job pulling together the threads of the past plots, and winding them all together to create a cohesive ending.<br /><br />But I also feel that the book was too long.  It seems that Rowling felt like she *had* to put the climax of the book at the end of the Hogwart's school year, and that the rest of the book was just waiting around to get there.  Too much time was spent wandering around and hiding, rather than taking action.  Voldy and his Death Eater's are reeking havoc about the land, and our three heroes are hiding at various locations.  I expected more of an longstanding battle to progress throughout the entire book.  The events that took place while the heroes were in hiding felt contrived.<br /><br />Also the epilogue left a lot to be desired.  It was not well thought out, and left a bitter taste in my mouth.  Why do it at all if you aren't going to brief about the other characters and the state of the wizarding world post-climatic event?<br /><br />Overall, the Deathly Hallows is a fitting conclusion to the Harry Potter series, though, but I do not feel it is a 5 star book or in anyway the best of the series.
