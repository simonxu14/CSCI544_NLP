Well, I loved the first two books. But Mockingjay just fell short. First off, this book was more of a 'telling' than 'seeing'. There were so many parts that needed to be extended, instead she just brush right threw them. The ending was awful as well. So many questions were left unanswered, I mean, a war had just happened. What the heck was going on? What happened? What happened to the districts? To the characters? I was disappointed, since this book could've been amazing. But it's the last book in the series so you have to finish it and read it.
