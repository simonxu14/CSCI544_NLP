Was hoping for some amazing twists from 'background' characters in books 1 & 2, i.e. Was Madge's mom really sick or just a mole in the mayor's home? Did Madge intentionally give Katniss the mockingjay pin on Haymitch's orders? Would Madge find love with Gale?<br />How would Peeta survive and become the mouthpiece for the revolution? Would Katniss allow herself to love and find her strength and balance through love with Peeta?<br />For me, it felt like Ms. Collins was straddling a line between writing the screenplay for Hunger Games and a deadline to finish book 3. I also felt like the author had a very strict agenda--WAR IS HELL. Her agenda muted the characters, and all the set-ups in books 1 & 2 were abandoned, as were the characters.<br />It is a grim ending/moral: war is hell, humanity's unsinkable hope turns depressing at best, there's no joy to be found, even in your own family.<br />Katniss and Peeta are no longer the youthful, fiery heralders of truth and freedom as established in books 1 & 2, instead, they are used up pawns whose future looks cloudy at best and down right futile at worst.<br />Ugh.
