Like most others, I was drawn to reading the book after hearing the hype about and watching the movie. The first book in the series was good, but I personally think the movie does the book justice and then some. It was good to get some insight into the storyline by reading the book but I would rather watch the movie. After reading the trilogy you completely see Jennifer Lawrence in her role as Katniss and Josh Hutcherson as Peeta. I'm not quite sold on Liam Hemsworth as Gale, however. The advantage to reading the book is that it gives you back story that the movie simply cannot. The advantage to seeing the movie is that you visualize what's happening on a grander scale than you ever imagined. I was a little bored with reading the final book in the trilogy, &#34;Mockingjay&#34; but am looking forward to the movie release. It's the first time I can say with a straight face that the movie was better than the book. I'm sure that will rustle some feathers, but it's my opinion.
