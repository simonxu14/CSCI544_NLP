Well written, compelling trilogy , but not fit for young minds in my opinion.  Even when one won the hunger games, it was a loss.  Also, killing for viewer's entertainment left me very discouraged about that society (I hope not our current society).  I read the books because my teen aged grandchildren were reading them and I objected to their reading them. Then it occurred to me that if I was going to object to a book, I should have at least read it.  I must admit that the books were compelling enough that when I had read The Hunger Games, I certainly wanted to read the rest so I could see how it turned out.  In a word, disturbing!
