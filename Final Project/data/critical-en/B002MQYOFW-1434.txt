Keep in mind: I absolutely loved the first two books in this series...but I just couldn't manage to get into this one. It was different, is the only way I know to put it. For one, were not in the arena anymore and that added a lot to the other two novels...more than I previoulsy realized...MOckingjay was just totally depressing. I understand a writer has to put their characters through the ringer for a good story, but somehow it just doesn't quite work here. The painted picture even by the last page, is just so morbid and hopeless...I kept wondering if perhaps Katniss should just slit her wrists and have done with it all. Wanted so much to love it, but couldn't.
