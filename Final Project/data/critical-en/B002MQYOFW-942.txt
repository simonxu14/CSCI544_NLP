This is the third book in this trilogy. The first two were fantastic: well written, imaginative, action packed. The third had a fair amount of action but overall it was underwhelming.  It felt like disjointed, as if the author wasn't sure how to end the series. It took twice as long for me to finish Mockingjay because frankly, it was depressing. Katniss's actions made her less endearing with each chapter and the other characters reeked of despair. This was an unsatisfying ending indeed. If this had been book two I would not have read the third installment.
