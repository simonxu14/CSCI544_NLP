This book was a great disappointment to me: emotionally, intellectually, artistically, and morally.<br /><br />Morally, I don't buy that Katniss's actions are moral and Gale's immoral. I don't buy that what she does is right and what he (or Beetee, for example) does is wrong. The slight  bit of dialogue regarding Gale's actions is insufficient, especially when, at the end, there is no dialogue at all over Katniss's action. In fact, Gale discusses his actions with other soldiers before taking them. Katniss discusses with nobody: she acts solely on her own.<br /><br />Which brings up artistically. Most of what "happens" in this story happens off-page, as in the trial scene at the end. We aren't there, we don't see it, it is merely reported to us in brief summary. Whenever anything important happens, Katniss is conveniently sedated. And the final battle scenes at the Capitol seemed a hodge-podge of random obstacles meant to be shocking and startling, but leading nowhere. The Hunger Games were best in the first book, weakened in the second book and here, in the third book, least interesting and believable of all.<br /><br />Which brings up emotionally. I cannot get emotionally involved in a story in which the hero is an emotional mess who is sedated during crucial times. I can feel compassion for this person, yes. I can understand why they are this way. But that doesn't mean I want to read an entire book about a person in this state. Katniss was a hero in the first book. I began to worry about her almost-obtusely naive nature in the second book. I didn't want to believe that the series would go in the direction it went: to Katniss being a mere symbol of, not a fighter for, the rebellion/revolution. The way she allows herself to be used in the third book is disappointing, to say the least.<br /><br />And intellectually: does Katniss have any thoughts other than that she misses District 12, and she doesn't like to follow orders? In any revolution, there are huge issues at stake: who will govern and how will they be elected? who will own the means of production and how will the necessities of life be distributed? (you would think this would be of critical importance to starving citizens), who will be citizens and who not? what will education be like? travel? housing? I don't want a novel that's a tract on any of these issues, but I would like to know that the hero is aware of the issues and maybe talks about them with her friends and fellow soldiers.<br /><br />What happened to Peeta during captivity is believable. His recovery is not: it occurs too quickly to be true. And the way Katniss treats Peeta makes me loose any remaining sympathy I had for her. This is probably the most disappointing third book in any trilogy I've ever read.
