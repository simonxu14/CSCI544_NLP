Similar to many reviewers, I very much enjoyed the first two books and was thoroughly disappointed with Mockingjay. There is a difference between realism and poorly nuanced/rushed treatment, as I elaborate below:<br /><br />While perhaps good material for a 3D movie, the action/twists and turns were rather difficult to visualize and follow on paper. It might've been better to focus on/flesh out a few scenes, rather than have the crew constantly stumble from pod to bizarre pod, and line-of-fire to miraculous escape route. For a book that was so 'realistic' in its ultimate ending, the consistently miraculous escapes against all odds seemed too Harry Potter-esque, and out-of place in this scenario.<br /><br />Along similar lines, character development had limited logic to it  - if I hadn't been focused when reading the one-sentence introduction of Paylor, I might have been left wondering who on earth the next President would be. On the other hand, pages were devoted to the development of Johanna's eccentric character, with no mention of what eventually happened to her. Why did the relationship between Katniss and Gale sour for no apparent reason and why did she choose Peeta over Gale - was it simply Gale's complicity in the bomb? Does that mere act, despite him not having known of Prim's presence in the crowd, negate everything else we've been led to believe about her feelings for him? Leaving something open to interpretation is no excuse for poorly nuanced treatment of such a central issue. As it stands, it sounds like Gale vanished into another district (very unlike him, based on his previous character development) and Peeta and Katniss were simply thrown together, as two people who'd had all else stripped from them. This seems to go a bit too far, all in the name of realism.<br /><br />Finally, why was the reader left out of such a momentous occasion - the toppling of the Capitol? While I was ofcourse not expecting a happy tale of democracy, we needn't have been entirely deprived of any satisfaction around the rebels' victory. To me, the series is about more than just the Hunger Games - its about future states of the world and the permanence of tensions between autocracy and democracy. While Collins doesn't explicitly make political parallels, a one paragraph description of the eventual governance structure would have given readers like me some food for thought.<br /><br />There is a fine line between explicit and unsaid parallels with our current state of affairs, realism and 'happy endings', truth and inspiration. Collins seems to have gone too far to the left in the final book.
