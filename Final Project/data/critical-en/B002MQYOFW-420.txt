Just imagine yourself as the author of Hunger Games and you have been given the directions to write the hunt to the death for the 24 children using primarily present day advances in technology and not some of the bizarre or beyond all possible coincidence scenes and effects that we were subjected to. Hey you writers out there; of course you could do it and I submit that it could have been a much finer novel and left you with a much scarier and realistic feeling.<br /><br />Like feeling: "Wow, this could really have happened."<br /><br />Also, if there were an opportunity to rewrite, I would have put it in first person past point of view and not first person present and, most importantly, I would have included some chapters in some of the other characters point of view. That opportunity was lost staying in first person present with the protagonist for the entire book. Also the ending got a little fuzzy with the evil president that the author never really followed up on. And one always feels a little cheated by an abrupt ending that is primarily a promo for the next book in the series and doesn't satisfactorily end this book.<br /><br />It's still a good book; it just could have been better.
