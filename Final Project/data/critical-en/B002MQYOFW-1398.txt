Hate to hate on a book that has a strong female lead but there's a kind of knee-jerk, anti-government streak running through this series.<br /><br />Mockingjay ends in peacetime but the author doesn't explain or even hint at the system of governance that replaced the totalitarian government, which had enforced and perpetuated the two-tier society of the extremely privileged and the poor labourer class. So get rid of the government - any government - and you'll be okay and free to live in peace?<br /><br />I'm eager to see some YA books that have something positive - balanced and intelligent or complex - to say about government, authority/collectivity, and society. Mockingjay essentially concludes with the idea that peace is only ever temporary and humans are predisposed to forgetting the horrors of war and violence and making the same errors again and again.<br /><br />It's a horribly violent series and runs in the mainstream (with other dystopian YA books such as the horribly overrated The Maze Runner series, the Legend (Prodigy) series, and the Divergent series (also boring and overrated)) as such: to be edgy and interesting you have to have a ton of violence. Feed the lizard brain, will you? And start on them young, please.<br /><br />Oh, and yes, it's always the authority figure / the government's fault, arguably linked to the subtext that collectivity can never be a good thing. Why do so many popular YA books use this underlying assumption in their thematic focus? It's not really deep or terribly interesting, and it has been done to death, moreover.<br /><br />To this reader, the violence in these books are used to further plot points and for shock value and to titillate rather than for purposes relating to genuine exploration of the purported issues (reality TV, dystopia, war, revolution, mortality, and the supposed human tendency toward violence; please see Lord of the Flies or books by Sonya Hartnett for contrast).<br /><br />And Lois Lowry's The Giver, for example, is a great YA book about structuralised violence in a dystopian society. The distrust of Those in Charge and the status quo in that book is interesting and Jonas's context gives him a chance to process it in an intelligent and reasoned way. Throughout the book, Jonas matures and transforms, and he comes to know why he must revolt (leave); Katniss, on the other hand, is simply assaulted over and over again by Those in Charge, so she's motivated by nothing much other than her reactive rage, whether this is for herself, her family, or her love interests. As a fundamental pillar of the book's thematic arc, there's also, of course, the beyond cliched, simplistic lone-heroine/hero theme, which is on par with the subtext of the superhero films we get a lot of these days.<br /><br />To the series mentioned above I'll add Tales of the Otori, which is not so much a dystopian YA novel but which is also very violent. The writer of that series is actually capable of writing serious prose; still, Otori was pornographic in its violence.<br /><br />Additionally, I've read my share of hard SF books and the futuristic details in these books are vague and lame.<br /><br />Finally, the style and tone are indeed flat (as has been pointed out by other reviewers). There's a &#34;written-for-the-screen&#34; feel about this series. Written at a very superficial level and overrated to this particular reader.
