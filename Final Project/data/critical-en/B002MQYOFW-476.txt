I know that I have read a &#34;youth&#34; book by the short, stilting sentences and sparse descriptions. I certainly like the concept, though, because it seems to cut close to the grain in the sense that people are under constant surveillance these days. It is reminiscent of George Orwell's &#34;1984&#34; in that Panem resembles the divisions he introduced. Also, I saw a correlation between the TV screens in Orwell's book and Collins' technological advancement of a few.
