I tore through all three books in about a day each. They're fast paced and gripping. Yes, there are some faults; some convenient things happen "off screen" that shortcut to the characters' next plot points; the romantic struggles get a little tiresome, but overall these are very entertaining stories that made for a fast, exciting read, and wove many important social issues into the story - just like sci-fi should.
