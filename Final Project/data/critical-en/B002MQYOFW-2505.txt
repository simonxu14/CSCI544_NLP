A fast read but far too violent with mind searing images for young people.  And repetitive.....going through all that again with more scarifying situations to give kids bad dreams.  A real contrast to the type of adventure/with some violence in Harry Potter and even the violence in the Lord of the Rings which is mythical enough to dismiss afterwards.  Collins has a A plus for imagination but would it were directed to adults, not children. As a teacher and parent I read this to see what had kids mesmerized.  Had a hard time making myself finish....horror situations ad nauseum.
