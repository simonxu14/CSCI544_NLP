The story was great as are all of the Harry Potter books, but there were 2 major problems with the printing of the copy I have.  There are 31 pages missing completely (pages 339 through 370 missing), and pages 307 through 338 are repeated twice.  Very frustrating, and of course is was ordered and received long ago so no way to replace the book.
