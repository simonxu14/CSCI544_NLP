Book Five is finally here!  Book Four left us with many unanswered questions, and although "Order of the Phoenix" answers these, I still felt J.K. Rowling was either bored, or simply setting the stage for Book Six.<br />But then I consulted with the foremost authority on the books - my wife.  She pointed out that we are seeing things through Harry's eyes.  We feel Harry's frustration at being kept in the dark.  We feel torn between our past love for Albus Dumbledore and our disappointment that things aren't the same.<br />While reading, I couldn't help making two comparisons:<br />1) This book is much like the first 2/3 of David Copperfield - it is kind of a long, drawn-out narrative that familiarizes you so much with the characters that you feel much more intimately involved.  Things don't always work out in the book as we want them to, or expect them to, but these only serve to feel Harry's frustration at a personal level.  If this was the intent, J.K. Rowling did this masterfully;<br />2) There is kind of a Star Wars feel about this book, meaning the mystery surrounding Luke Skywalker's origin compared to Harry's scar.  You half expect Lord Voldemort to say, "Harry, I am your father.  Feel the burning in your scar and you will know I speak the truth..."<br />Not the best book of the series so far, but we'll have to wait and see what Book Six holds to know if Book Five is as important as I suspect it is.<br />You're going to read the book anyway, so just go ahead and buy it now and do it!
