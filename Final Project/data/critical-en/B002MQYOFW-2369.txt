I came staight to the internet to warn others after finishing this series.  "Mockingjay" was a total let down. I really enjoyed the first two books. I couldn't wait to read the final one.  It was anticlimaxtic at best, and depressing to see good characters go to waste, including the surviors.  I had hoped for so much more. Editors should have seen through this one! I had recommended this series to my 12 year old daughter to read, but I plan now to retrieve the book before she starts, to save her the time and save her dreams! Very disappointing!
