I enjoyed reading the first two books so much that I had a hard time setting them down. The third book however felt like more of a chore than anything else. I found myself re-reading the pages and forgetting what I just read because it was so boring. In the end, nothing made sense. I wasn't expecting a neat and tidy ending but I did want a well written book that pulled me in to their world like the first two books did.<br />I think the author had a great idea for a book but never really figured out how to finish the story. This book was almost a complete disappointment but I gave it two stars because I liked the epilogue.
