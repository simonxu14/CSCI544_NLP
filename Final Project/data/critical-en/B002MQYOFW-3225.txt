** SPOILER **<br /><br />I didn't like the books at all.  There were such rave reviews that I thought it would be a set worth reading.. it definetly is not.  As I read the books, all I could think of is those real children in countries which actually do use children as animals to be hunted and killed by others-for sport.<br />The books were so boring. I could easily know the next move, continually.  I was far too bored of the books so I thought I would see the movie... that was another snooze fest.<br />If you aren't into teen movies, or you have half a brain to figure out what's next.. save your money and pass this up.
