I had no plans to read the books or see the movies until DISH gave us a free weekend with HG in the lineup. Watched it and it intrigued me enough to want to read the book. So in a rare move, I paid full price for the books, and read them all in five days. I should have stopped at the first book. The second book was okay, but once it was read, reading the third book was a must. So, should have stopped at HG. After I read Mockingjay, I started reading the reviews to see why people liked it so much, because I did not. It seems that of those that don't like it, the fans like to uniformly criticize them for not understanding that this was a war, that war is ugly, deaths are senseless, and that they shouldn't have expected a fairytale ending. I've noticed that some rabid fans have even cut and pasted the same rebuttal to several reviews, strange. My main criticism of the book is that the story did not evoke any emotion from me. Some have said that Katniss had PTSD and therefore her emotions were suppressed. Since the book is written in first person, Katniss' lack of emotional response makes the book read like a list. First this horrible thing happened, then I was mad, then I was crying, then I was hiding, then I ate, then that scary thing happened, then this person died, then we were running... I think the author's goal to write a book with a message interfered with her writing a good story. About the ending, I would have liked it to have been more developed. The emphasis on Katniss' PTSD meant that since she didn't care about anything, we didn't find out about what happened to many of the characters. Disappointed, what a waste of my time and money.
