If you haven't read the book, you've seen the film.  And if you haven't done either, you've certainly heard of it.  This is a fun book to read that (hopefully) is not taken as serious literary fantasy.  The book borders on dangerous to read, as its moral compass swings wildly, the characters are mostly stereotypes, and the plot is melodramatic and self-indulgent.  For all that, if one takes it for what it is--a diversionary children's story--it can be read with enjoyment.  But make no mistake: This is not subtle, mythic fantasy.  No one with a sense of aesthetic taste would actually consider the writing to be imaginative or powerful, the characters original, or the plot moving.  It is the McDonald's hamburger of the fictional world: Fun to read, easy to put down (and pick back up), and too much is not good for you.  Don't question the characters' actions or look for a multilayered and complex plot because they do not exist.  The fantastical setting--the wainscot world Rowling develops--is conveniently inconsistent throughout the series, starting with Book 1.  This book is not just the hamburger of the fictional world: It is a high-fat burger with loads of filler.
