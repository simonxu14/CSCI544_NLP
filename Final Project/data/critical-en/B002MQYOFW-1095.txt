I found the narrative, that takes you through the decision making process of the main characters, to portray the those characters as a little flawed and impetuous. Too often they didn't consider likely alternatives, but jumped to conclusions. Its more akin to the way I thought as a teenager, so I guess it can be forgiven. Maybe I expect too much from the lead characters?
