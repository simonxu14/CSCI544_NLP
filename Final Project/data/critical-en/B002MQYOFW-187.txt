I surely wasn't looking for a fairy tale ending. In fact, I was HOPING it wouldn't be an asinine fairy tale ending, and it wasn't ~ so that's the good news.<br /><br />The bad news is as follows:<br /><br />For the first two books and about 99.999% of the last book, we are treated to Katniss's every waking (and dreaming) thought in great, vivid detail. There is never any room for guesswork, and you always know where Katniss's is coming from; why she makes the decisions she does; why her actions were as they were; how she feels about things after they have transpired.  Then, all of a sudden, at the tail end of the last book, all that disappears. It just completely drops away and the epilogue fast forwards fifteen years with a "barely there" explanation of how things became what they are in those last fifteen years.  There is not one single iota of decent writing explaining  Katniss's evolution beyond the Hunger Games.  Many readers explain this as the way soldiers are when they come back from war:  they aren't living their lives, they just exist.  That may be true for a vast majority of soldiers, but then they end up like Haymitch who just exists with endless bottles of booze. But somehow, Katniss ended up with a partner and a family. You don't just exist through having a relationship (and sex) with one out of the only two men you've ever loved; you don't just exist through two pregnancies; you don't just exist through two births.  We know that Katniss's was wary of leading the life she has come to live, but that's the only hint of the once complicated, complex, passionate girl we are given. For all other intents and purposes, Katniss's goes from interesting girl warrior to boring, middle aged soccer mom.<br /><br />Who Katniss's ended up with between Gale and Peeta wasn't an issue for me. I knew in the first sentence of the second book who she would end up with and why. And that made sense to me. But all the colorful, flavorful, deep, heartfelt explanations in Katniss's voice that had previously brought the reader INTO the story vanished into thin air. So, in the end, the reader has absolutely no investment whatsoever in Katniss's as an adult, or her life, her children's lives, her partner's life, or the life they have together.<br /><br />The first two books and the entire third book are spent with Katniss's from the time she is sixteen until she is seventeen.  Then the Epilogue jumps ahead fifteen years and spends but a couple pages on Katniss's current life and the things that lead up to it. Not only do you not "know" Katniss's anymore, but you also don't give a crap because any emotions or interest you had invested in her character disappear right along with the author's ability to write.<br /><br />It's almost as if the author got bored with the story and just decided to hurry up and tie off the few loose ends in all of about ten minutes time. Or, as if the manuscript's drop dead due date was the next morning, so she just dropped in a few words and called it a day with the "Epilogue" so that the publishers wouldn't take back the money they paid her for the third installment.<br /><br />For me, the "way" things ended was fine ~ I just would have liked to have traveled to the end with Katniss's the way we traveled through the rest of her life: in her head, with all her thoughts, good, bad, or otherwise.
