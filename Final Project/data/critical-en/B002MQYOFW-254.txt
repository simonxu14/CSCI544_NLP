An interesting little story of a young lady in terrible circumstances. The plot is driven mostly by red<br />throwing her into worse predicaments. A tale that keeps the readers engaged with tense mind games and quick action scenes.<br />Not the best written apocalyptic series out there, but a good way to get teenagers to read.
