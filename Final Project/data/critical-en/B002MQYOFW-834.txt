Yikes. This book was a little unfortunate... I was okay with Katniss's sudden character change, since it just shows how badly not one but TWO hunger games can screw with her mind. Her mental fragility was actually a welcome change. I even liked how District Thirteen was used. But my God what an underwhelming conclusion. There were parts that were just too rushed, and parts that were not rushed enough. I hated how the romance was just a little side note. Yes, we know that Katniss is not exactly the most romantic protagonist the book world has seen but COME ON. It was a little half-a**ed and the ending was just... not... good. Just when I thought there would be a climax... no climax... or somewhat of a climax??? Eh. I gave this book three stars because of Katniss's interesting character development. I took that, but I wish I could have left everything else. Meh.
