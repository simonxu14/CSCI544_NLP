THERE IS NO HAPPY ENDING! PLEASE, PLEASE, SAVE YOURSELF FROM A HORRIFIC EVIL SADISTIC STORY THAT WILL LEAVE YOU FEELING LIKE THE WORLD IS AN EVIL PLACE AND WE ARE ALL GONE DIE HORRIBLE DEATHS!!<br /><br />Please do not read these horrifying books!<br /><br />The first book sucks you into thinking this will be a great series but they are not.<br /><br />This sadistic woman(who needs to be locked up in a mental institution) destroys everyone and everything with pathetic reasoning after thought notations.<br /><br />You think all the people in these books are dying to protect this main character and they are brave and their sacrifice will save the day. Get that thought out of your head now none of them die for a good cause they all die in vain.<br /><br />Here is a brief description of her happy ending.<br /><br />Everyone the main character loves is dead or has become evil. But the main character lives happily ever after half her body burnt to a crisp, with the man of her last option, while the people she fought for hate her but its okay cause the children she never wanted melt her heart in the last paragraph. Her kids don't even have a name. Oh and in the last chapter just to throw another nail in your heart she makes sure you know the only person the main character wasn't sure lived or died is found dead. No really reason for the added death didn't move the story along at all. Just a quick, "ohh by the way shes dead."<br /><br />Katniss is not a martyr to be thankful for she was a pawn that everyone used to greedily get what they want in a world that really didn't change.<br /><br />WHAT KIND OF A SCREWED UP STORY IS THIS!!!!<br /><br />This book made me hope Suzanne Collins dies before she can infect more anguish and hatefulness into the world.
