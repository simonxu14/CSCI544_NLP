"Mockingjay" is the final book in the Hunger Games Trilogy, and I thought the conclusion was a bit disappointing after the buildup in the first two books.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment was with Katniss' character where I felt she betrayed her true motivation.  There is a crucial scene near the end of the book, which I will not spoil here, where it feels like she completely betrays her reason for fighting in the 74th Hunger Games, and her reason for ultimately becoming the Mockingjay for the rebellion.<br /><br />I was also disappointed with the way the love triangle between Katniss, Gale, and Peeta is resolved in this book because it seems almost a non-issue for a big part of book of 3.  When it us finally resolved, it seemed a bit hurried and artificial to me.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the series, and I thought the first book was the best.
