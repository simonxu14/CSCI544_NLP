I liked the book, I thought it was well written and certainly very original. The premise is interesting and the author pulls no punches. However, in spite of a well-developed main character, the relationship to others around her felt flat. As a consequence I didn't develop a lot of connection with any of the characters and by the book's end, I firmly put it down, with not a speck of interest or curiosity about what would happen next.
