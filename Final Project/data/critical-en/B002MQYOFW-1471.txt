I just finished Mockingjay, the last book of the Hunger games.  I feel oddly distraught over the way that Suzanne Collins led me down me path, only to switch out the end and substituting the ending to a completely different novel, leaving a conclusion only in name.  I got answers, but not only were they not the answers that I thought I deserved, not to mention not even vaguely the answers I wanted....but they seemed to be answers that should have been obtained only through a different experience, a different way to get to the end, a different path.  I can respect an author's desire to keep things interesting and their right to rule their creation in the manner that they see fit, but I think, in the end, that she did herself, her world,and her faithful readers a bit of a disservice.  I reserve the right to reevaluate this opinion as I mull this over in the next few days.  Sometimes, emotions can cloud a judgement, and logic may win me over eventually.  We'll see.
