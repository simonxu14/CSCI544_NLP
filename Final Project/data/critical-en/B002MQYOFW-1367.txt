I DEVOURED The Hunger Games and Catching Fire within two days, and was extremely excited to finish off the series with Mockingjay. However, I was sorely disappointed. The fire that Katniss had shown in the beginning of the novel died down within the middle of the book, coming to a complete failure of an ending that Collins wrote.<br /><br />There were so many unresolved plot lines that could have been resolved; not necessarily with sugar and rainbows, but closure would have been nice.<br /><br />Instead, Gale was completely and utterly swept under the table, and instead of a reunion with, perhaps, an alarmingly alive Cinna, we get....Effie? Seriously? She wasn't even a contributing factor to Katniss' personality, which was already completely shattered. Instead of the powerful heroine leading the resistance, by the end of the lurching, hurriedly put together ending, we get a broken, watered down version of Katniss that barely seems to function.<br /><br />And that's it. A completely dissatisfying end to what could have been so much more in the Panem universe.
