Remember when you got to book 3 or 4 of the Harry Potter series and he got really whiny and cranky and Dumbledorf wouldn't talk to him and he thought everyone was out to get him?  Well, in Hunger Games Book 3, she gets very whiny and cranky -- not that she doesn't have her reasons.  She's suffering from post-traumatic stress and has a whopper of a head injury and one of her true loves, the one who kept her alive during the first 2 books, is in the hands of evil doers, but she spends an enormous amount of time in this book cowering in closets, weeping.  And I just found it a little unbelievable that grown up adults who had been so mistreated and enslaved by the evil doers and watched their children die year after year would need a 17 year old in a really fabulously designed uniform to rally them to rise up against said evil doers.<br /><br />Cowering in the closet is just not as compelling as fighting for your survival.
