I'd read this book in less than a week, I usually take my time and enjoy it. The characters in my opinion just became insignificant to me and lost the interest to finish the book. For example Peeta's characteristic just became a total havoc and Katniss ignorance just annoyed me. The previous two books were great, I actually enjoyed reading those compared to the last book. I feel like the author rushed the whole thing and destroyed the main characters.<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert do not continue reading* The ending is okay was a bit depressing. I wasn't satisfied with the ending at all. The two did end up together.
