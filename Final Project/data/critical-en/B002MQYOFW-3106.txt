I love the first two books. I pre-ordered the third and started reading as soon as it came in the mail. I was really disappointed with the story. It did not hold up to the first two books. It lacked the drive the others had. I remember staying up all night to read and this book didn't have that. Not a bad book to read, just not what I expected to end the hunger games.
