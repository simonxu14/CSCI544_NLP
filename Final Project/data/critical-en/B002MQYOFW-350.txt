For people who devoured the first and second book, you definitely need to read this one and complete the series. However, be warned that it's not going to be rainbows and butterflies.<br /><br />(No detailed spoilers, just comments on tone):<br />I really thought that Mockingjay was pretty depressing. Of course it was still powerful in its messages, and you can be assured that Suzanne Collins doesn't just leave the story incomplete. However, Katniss was in a state of post traumatic stress, and was depressed,  as were a lot of the people around her. Although the PTS is understandable after everything her character has endured (plus it's more realistic), I felt pretty sad while reading, and even after finishing this book. The feeling is kind of double sided...on one hand, it's realistic, but on the other, I wish that there was more than just the pressing feeling of sadness. Also, I was incredibly unsatisfied by the ending. The whole book was all dark and cloudy, and the ending does very little to alleviate that feeling. Once again, it's a double sided situation, but you can decide whether or not it suited your taste.<br /><br />Final verdict: Just read it! Especially if you've read the first two, or if you're going to see the movies. You've got nothing to lose! (No pain...no gain?)
