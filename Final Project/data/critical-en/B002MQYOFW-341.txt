If you want a more in depth opinion and analysis to why it was such a disappointment, go read any of the reviews here. They all will essentially tell you the same thing that's wrong with, "Mockingjay." So I'm just going to keep this short.<br /><br />This last book seemed rushed and was hard to understand at many points. The characters didn't seem like themselves at all. It was boring. The ending battle was a confusing whirlwind (I actually thought it was a dream at first....the writing was just so sloppy at this point). The resolution with who she chose (Gale or Peeta) seemed like a complete afterthought. Kind of like, "Oh, and by the way....she chose _____. The End."<br /><br />It essentially felt nothing like the first two installments. I'd actually recommend not even reading it. Just read a summary of what happend and make your own tale in your head to how it reached its conclusion.
