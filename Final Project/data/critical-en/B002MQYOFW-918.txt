I loved the first book and thought the second was 4 stars. I thought this book had to much what I call filler. To lengthy explanations of inner thoughts and situations. Why some of the people went the way they did is not explained very well and leaves you wondering. Some of these are the main characters. A few of the situations people were placed in were not believable. With all the planning and set up these never could have happened. I don't want to spoil any readers expectations by telling you what happens and you should read the book to judge for your self. I really didn't like the ending. It leaves too many holes that are not filled.
