I will begin by saying I won't be spoiling the ending in this review, because I hate it when there are spoilers all over the internet. What I do want to say is that this is one of the worst endings to a series I have ever read. Could it be any more obvious that she had no idea how to end this series? It was like one day she sat down, and said "I'm done with this" then wrote an ending in 10 minutes. I couldn't believe what a massive let down that was.<br /><br />Bad Suzanne Collins!
