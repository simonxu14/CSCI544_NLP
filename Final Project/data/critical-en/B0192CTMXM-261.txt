I was looking forward to this book.  I must admit, that as a fan of more "serious" fiction (i.e. George RR Martin), I may be somewhat jaded, but I do like to turn to series like HP when I want something a little lighter.<br /><br />That said, this book's plot is beyond light, it's almost non-existant. I had been happy with JK's plot twists, especially in book three and four, but the plot has gone dramatically down hill.  Also, I realize that the books are supposed to develope as the readers age, but some of the parts in this book would be closer to adult lit than kid lit (i.e. sexual inuindo).<br /><br />Others have mentioned the plot holes, inconsistencies, and character betrayal, so I'll just give two examples...and, there are spoilers ahead, so be warned.<br /><br />Snape and Lupin, whom I found to be two of the most intriguing characters from the start, seemed to develope fairly well over the course of the series.  I had always thought that JK would continue to develope these characters, but I was sadly mistaken. Apparently, Harry's angst and the difficulties of living in a tent are more important than giving good characters space in the last book of the series.<br /><br />I thought that JK would have an interesting reason for Snape's motivation and that Snape would prove himself in the end... And, well, he does in a way. (...)  I would have expected more from such a strong character.<br /><br />Lupin's character also gets the shaft... (...)  I expected Lupin to "step up" as the last of the four marauders left to Harry, but he has more of a cameo role in this book than a true part.<br /><br />All in all, a deacent story if you don't expect an interesting plot or a believable ending.  This book's plot reads as unbelievable, which should tell you something coming from a fantasy series.<br /><br />Alas, JK, I expected more and got less.
