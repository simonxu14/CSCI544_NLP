There's an awful lot to criticize about this book.  Yes, the premise is preposterous, even taken only as allegory.  Yes, the plot is juvenile, predictable, contrived and packed with annoying cop outs, including but not limited to a deus ex machina that's nonsensical and unnecessary in equal measure.

If nothing else, the author has certainly tapped into the psyche of the modern reality show-addled young adult.
