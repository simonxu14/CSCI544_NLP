The book for the main is as good as the previous 2 in the series and a great page turner until the end. Then it is like the author Suzanne Collins got fed up with writing the story and ended it with lots of things unsaid between main characters and no real explanation of the main character's thought process of her choices in the last few chapters. Quite frankly I was pretty mad and disappointed that such a great series of books was ended so poorly. It left me feeling annoyed I had &#34;invested&#34; so much time in getting to know the characters to be left feeling &#34;what happened here?!&#34;
