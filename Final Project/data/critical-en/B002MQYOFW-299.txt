I LOVED the first two books. Absolutely loved. I pre-ordered Mockingjay and waited in anticipation for this book to arrive in the mail. I tore into it the second it arrived, and I was just flat out disappointed.<br /><br />First of all, in the first two books there is much human emotion, connection between the characters, evolving relationships. I felt like there was NONE of that in this book. It was nothing but endless wars and bombs and fighting and planning to fight, and strategy, and filming propos... It was like... allrighttt enough already this book needs more depth!<br /><br />The only human connection in the book happened with the reunion of Finnick and Annie, it was such a great thing to happen and then Finnick dies by being beheaded by the mutts. Nothing more is said about him. He had such a prominent role in Katniss's life, helping her in her times of sorrow, and by having her back in war, and then he dies, and nothing at all is said. There's no explanation of how Annie took it or how Katniss felt, nothing.<br /><br />It's within the last 20 pages or so that the book actually picked up to where I actually started to take a liking to it and then the last 3 pages was more or less the author saying, "Well, the book needs to end ... soooo Prim dies, Gale moves, Katniss marries/lives with Peeta, 15 years pass, they have two kids, the end."<br /><br />There was absolutely no reason for Prim to be killed off either. Was there a shock value Collins was going for? I think so, but it didn't shock me, it totally missed the mark and fell flat. I didn't get the point. Most of her trust worthy friends had been killed, what was the reason for Prim being offed?<br /><br />I also don't get how for the first two books there is such an intense love coming from Gale and he has such unrequited love, he shows her, and then at the end of this book where Katniss's sister is killed, her friends are dead, she's an emotional disaster, he just goes on with his new big shot job, moves to 2 and never returns. What the hell is that?<br /><br />There's also no mention of Katniss ever seeing her mother again, so who knows if that even happened...<br /><br />The ending was the biggest copout of life. There just wasn't much substance to this book at all in my opinion. Any number of things could have been done with the final book, and this whole "War is Bad!" message is sending was a bit over the top. We know war is bad, people die, families are torn apart, but it doesn't need to be shoved in our faces, especially as the final book in a trilogy. This book should have went out with a bang. Instead it just fizzled, sputtered, and died.
