The first book was great, the second just about what expected, to be kind of a bridge for a great ending. This final book though, I really had great expectations on a great ending but it feels as if the writer has been told, "Hey, you got 1 month to finish your 3rd book, because we want to publish it as soon as possible." And the writer hasn't even started yet and rushed through it changing from a mild science fiction story to a very fictional story towards the ending.<br /><br />Of course you have to read it though, if you have already read the 1st and 2nd book you can't stop now. It isn't that bad either, is just that I was expecting a much better ending since the beginning(1st book) was great.
