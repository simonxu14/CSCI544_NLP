Wanted to see what all the hype was about on this most popular book series.  Sorry to say, it really IS for kids ... and I won't be reading any further &#34;adventures&#34; of Harry Potter.  Whereas CS Lewis's &#34;Chronicles of Narnia&#34; can be read by adults who can get a deeper message, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&#34; is a bunch of rabbit trails and extra verbiage (I suppose to keep kids entertained as they meander through pages and paragraphs of inconsequential material to the &#34;story&#34;).  I know it's a fun read for kids, but if you're an adult and you read a lot ... I wouldn't waste my time on this.
