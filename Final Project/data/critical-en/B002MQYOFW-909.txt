I read all three books in a very short time frame and can not wait for the movies to come out for books two and three.  Love the series!  But of the three books - this is my least favorite.<br /><br />I won't spoil it for anyone... but I do have to say I did get a little annoyed with how the author would sometimes jump ahead and skip a whole event by having a character "black out" only to have the information filled in by a brief re-account from another character.  Seemed like a lazy way to get through the story.<br /><br />And I wonder if by book three if the author wasn't just trying to close up some loose ends anyway... because the ending really, really seemed a bit... weak.<br /><br />But if you have been reading the series you do have to read the final book to have closure...  Otherwise - you never know what happens.
