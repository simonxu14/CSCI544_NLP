I almost stopped reading it at several places, thinking it was (1) very poorly written, and (2) just plain annoying with regard to Katnisses character. I guess good reading for 14-16-year old girls, but for anyone else just OK, if not less. Liked "Catching Fire" better, where there was an actual plot, and only read the latter because I saw the movie.
