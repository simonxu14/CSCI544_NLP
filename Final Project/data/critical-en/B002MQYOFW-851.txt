I bought this because. . . well, I couldn't wait for the movie.  When I was half way through I stopped reading because I realized it is a major spoiler.  Having also read Catching Fire, the book is exactly the movie and it is a kill joy in terms of enjoying the movie.  I didn't find the language in the books to be more engaging than the films.  Game of Thrones for example is a case where you can read the books then watch the series and both experiences are different because of the way the books are written.  With this series, I think reading the books kills the thrill of the films.  The movies are very well done, and a great cast.  Don't spoil the experience.  Wait for the movie to come out!
