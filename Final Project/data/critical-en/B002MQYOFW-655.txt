Suzanne Collins had it going on with the first installment of the series, but seems to lose steam as the following two books progressed.  Not to spoil the book for readers, but suffice it to say that the author pushed through the climax in record time and left me feeling that a lot of interesting plot and character closure was left unfinished.  As I read the last page, I found myself wondering how the movie screen writers are going to deal with their project and potentially improve on a rather unsatisfying experience.
