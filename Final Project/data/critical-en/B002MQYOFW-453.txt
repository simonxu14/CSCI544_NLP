Ok, don't hate me but I was super disappointed by this book. I was expecting this to be freaking epic. But it is just an average book in my opinion. I think if I werern't an avid reader I would have enjoyed it more. There wasn't enough romance. Now I haven't read book 2 or 3 but I don't think I'll read them becuase I didn't get attached 2 any of the characters. I saw the movie and it was like my 2nd fave movie of all time[behind the Avengers of course].
