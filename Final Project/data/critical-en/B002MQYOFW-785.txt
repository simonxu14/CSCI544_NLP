As a mother of preteen boys who were interested in reading the Hunger Games trilogy, I reluctantly read the first of the three books. Despite the horrifying premise, I very much enjoyed the first book - the Hunger Games. I even defended the book to other moms because  the development of Katniss's character was compelling. There were moments in Catching Fire that were more disturbing, I thought, than the events of book 1. However, this third book, Mockingjay, is very graphically violent and disturbing for a book in a trilogy that was marketed for young adults. Call me naive, but I was hoping for a little more of the triumph of the human spirit in this third and final book.
