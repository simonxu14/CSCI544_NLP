I had a hard time rating this trilogy. The writing is very good. The story arc is epic in scope, with a large cast of characters, and enough plot elements to make a Chem major go crazy.<br /><br />So what I liked. Very descriptive without drowning your own imagination. Excellent pacing between action, drama, and long arc plot development. An in depth look at human nature and what becomes of a mind depending on its social environment. Ultimately this story explores human sociology and our own tendency to dominate one another, and when finally pushed to far over turn that dominance. Along the way we also see the ramifications of individual psychological impact of repeated traumatic life experiences and the results of human misery in the fractured mind of our protagonist. It's amazing, detailed, brave, honest, and hopeful.<br /><br />Alright then here's what I didn't like. It was horribly depressing. The main character starts out as an already emotionally walled off young teenager that had to grow up to fast. It's basically all downhill for her from there. Facing almost certain death to save a sister, being forced into fake relationships, having loved ones threatened with death, having them tortured, killed en mass, find a small spring of hope, and then right at the end, snuffing it all out. By the end I almost wanted to open up my own wrists. The author throws you a tiny bone in the closing pages. But let's be honest, it's kind of like saying &#34;so youâ€™re a blind paraplegic, at least you have your health&#34;.<br /><br />I am a little surprised this is called young adult. The content is graphically violent, extremely advanced in its discovery of human misery, and not very subtitle in exploration of politics at most evil. That aside it is a very good story. I finally decided I would rate a 3 star. I did like it. However, it's hard enough to read that I don't think I will be reading it again.
