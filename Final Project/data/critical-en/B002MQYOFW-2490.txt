It is impossible to write about what I didn't like about this third installment of the Hunger Games without "spoiling" it for those who haven't read it.... Sorry...<br /><br />It's dark. It's depressing. It's one tragic turn of events after another. It's apparent that those who gave this book rave  reviews accepted and enjoyed this type of ending for the series. Some people enjoy a heart-wrenching tragedy. I didn't. I expected better.<br /><br />Peeta: The light and joy of the story - his love for Katniss is destroyed and his influential abilities are totally wasted. MIA for most of the story and when he is reintroduced his character is totally changed. He had such potential to be the "voice" of the rebellion. He represented everything good and noble in the society and when he was removed and changed we were left with darkness and hopelessness that could not be overcome. I sorely missed him.<br /><br />Katniss: I understand that at the end of the book when she votes "yes" for Coin's new Hunger Games her intention is to assassinate Coin to prevent the same-old-same-old - a different regime but the same Evil. I understand that Haymitch knows this at the time of the vote without it ever being spoken. I understand that her mental state during the novel sets up the ending defense at her trial - not guilty due to mental instability. However, it is highly unlikely that in ANY society she would have gotten away with assassinating the new President and have been set free with supervised psychiatric care even with such a defense.<br />From what we know about Katniss in the previous two novels, there is NO WAY she would have condoned continuing the Hunger Games in any form. She did what she had to in order to prevent their continuation. That being said, it was a long-suffering ordeal to read hundreds of pages of her mental and physical torments. I also can't get past the whole scene with her failed attempt to assassinate Snow - a continuing theme through the book of how many lives have been lost that Katniss was directly or indirectly responsible for. Her assassination of Coin was the one thing that went right for Katniss, but I must admit I saw it coming.<br /><br />What I didn't see coming was the death of Prim. I actually had to read the passage twice to figure out what had actually happened. It wasn't initially clear to me why Prim would even be there. Irony, yes, that the entire series starts with Katniss acting to save Prim's life and Prim ends up dying anyway. But sadness heaped upon sadness adds up to numbness and by that time I just didn't care anymore. I had figured out where this story was going long ago and already resigned myself to it.<br />The death of Finnick was also totally unnecessary. (Yes, I understand "war is hell", nobody really "wins", etc. etc.) Collins didn't have to kill off beloved characters to prove that. She'd already drilled it into us in a multitude of ways. At least she didn't kill the cat.<br /><br />The ending was so unsatisfying. The relationships that we had in the first two books between Katniss and Peeta and Katniss and Gale are resolved by default. We get ONE PAGE summing up this whole relationship situation that was CENTRAL to the stories in the first two books. I almost feel like Collins set us up with this wonderful love story and then loosed her real agenda in the third book.<br /><br />I read and re-read the first two books and longingly looked forward to the third but I doubt that I will ever read it again.
