Really enjoyed the series overall. And I am certainly ok with the idea that not every hero story ends with a stereotypical happy ending. But in this case, I feel like the author killed off a key character for shock value, set-up an over-obvious realization by the protagonist, and then didn't know how to end the book. Some would argue the ending fit the rest of the story. But I would suggest that we should get a little more closure on our relationship with the protagonist, even if she does not have closure for the events in her life.
