I enjoyed this trilogy emensely, however, I found the ending a little disappointing.  The plot line felt forced and rushed at the end and lost a bit of the storytelling magic.  It felt like Collins was trying to wrap up the story and was running out of pages in which to do it.  In addition, the deaths of a couple of characters (no spoilers, don't worry) didn't have as much impact as they should have.  All said, I still recommend the triology as a highly enjoyable read.
