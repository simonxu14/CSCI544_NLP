A decent story, but not too profound. The style of writing is too simple, almost like something you'd progress to after having read Goosebumps all along. The story is uncomplicated and slightly Twilight-ish when it comes to the kinds of detail the author chooses to focus on (if I'd known, I'd have reconsidered buying). After all, with a teenaged female protagonist and written from a feminine point of view, I should've seen it coming. Otherwise good enough when you have a few hours to spend reading something reasonably engaging.
