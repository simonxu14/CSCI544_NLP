I was very disappointed in the ending of this book.  The entire book was a bit slow, especially the beginning, and it did not feel like a full story.  There was fighting; there were deaths; and then boom...this is the end.  I thought I was excited to read this book because I really liked Catching Fire, the second book in the Hunger Games series.
