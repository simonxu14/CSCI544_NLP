Our heroine lives in a totalitarian state with the usual food shortages and violent police force. She survives a gladiator- style competition she is forced to take part in and wins but annoys the State. She has two men head over heels in love with her and she cannot choose between them. She fights, gets injured several times but survives and almost singlehandedly brings down the oppressive State. This is all done before she turns eighteen. I am not against feminism or even &#34;girl power&#34; but this is just over the top.<br />However, Suzanne Collins can keep one reading. The story is well told.
