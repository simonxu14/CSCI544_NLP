I will say this--The Hunger Games is a fast-paced novel that tells an engaging enough story. But that's part of the problem--it's *just* enough.<br /><br />It's far superior to the last YA book series sensation, Twilight: Hunger Games has a strong, independent heroine who actually fights and has some personality; while it has elements of romance, the story truly turns on survival; it makes a few motions towards larger political issues; and it is fairly competently written.<br /><br />With that said, what could have been an incredibly poignant situation--24 children forced to fight to the death--is reduced to an adrenaline rush, much like a real fight because hardly any of the contenders are fleshed out as characters. I found it hard to care about any of them except Rue, whose appeal is due to her young age. We get hints, but they're all cheap two-dimensional cartoons. Even Katniss and Peeta don't feel completely real at times. This is issue of quick-sketch writing plagues the entire book; it could easily have been twice as long without seeming overwrought if characters and cultural realities of the world were developed a bit more.<br /><br />This book is as lean as the characters. An entertaining read whose hints at depth turn out to be trompe l'oeil.
