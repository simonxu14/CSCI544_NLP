Mockingjay was just OK!<br /><br />The last too books I found riveting, this one, I was dying to complete it.  It was boring, repetitive and instead of the writer building Katniss' character, I found that she was reduced to being annoying, weak and boring.<br /><br />I thought Katniss would have turned out to be a heroine but she didn't come close to it. She was practically in the hospital for more than half of the book - her character in Mockingjay is always confused and whining; to the point of being pathetic.<br /><br />If, you really look at the whole picture, Katniss has always been the one to be saved by other people.  Saved by Peeta, Rue and Thresh in the first book.  Saved by Finnick, Joahanna and Plutarch in the second book.  The list of people saving her continues.  Very disappointment with how her character regressed.<br /><br />I was really trying to like this book but at the end of it I realize there's nothing to like about Mockingjay.
