I liked the book quite a bit.  The only issue I have is it seems like to meet a deadline the last 25% of the book was just slapped down on paper.  The LOVE the first book and the 2nd was very good also..  Just didnt seem like the same author for the last part of this book..... Other than that  awesome series  Also  I kept waiting for the pearl to play a significant part in Peeta's recovery...  just sayin'
