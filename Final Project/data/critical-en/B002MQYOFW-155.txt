This is by far the slowest book in the hunger games series. The beginning of the book drags and then all of a sudden moves entirely too fast leaving you confused at times. I had to reread numerous sections because MAJOR events happened in a blink of an eye whereas some of the non-important aspects dragged for chapters. The ending left me totally unsatisfied and seemed like the author just rushed the entire thing. So much more could have happened and so much was left untold. In the end it is still a page turner but if you're a die hard fan beware this may leave you unsatisfied.
