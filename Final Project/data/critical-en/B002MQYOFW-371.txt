The best thing I can say about this book is that it is the end of the series.<br /><br />Once you finish this book, two things will be certain:<br /><br />1)You'll be in tears<br />2)You'll want to inflict bodily harm on Suzanne Collins for the ending.<br /><br />It's obvious the author had no attachment to main characters by the end of the book- or at least it certainly felt like it.
