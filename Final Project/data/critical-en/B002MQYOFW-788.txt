Although I am sure I will be scoffed at by the millions of teenage fans that support Collins' story and the movies based off of the Hunger Games novels, I chose a 3 star rating precisely for that reason.  Although The Hunger Games is a good story with an interesting plot, it is not worthy of any outstanding awards.  The main character is very hard to like due to her frequent selfish and stubborn decisions, which make rooting for her very forced.  The romance aspect of the novel is very reminiscent of the Twilight Saga, in which the main character is torn between two different love interests.  There are many parts that seem to be too dramatized in the sense that Collins is trying to make her world sound big, impressive and astounding, when really it feels as though there was little thought put into it.<br /><br />Overall, the book is great for teenagers, which the book is mainly intended for.  However, if you are looking for a novel that will draw you in completely and immerse you into the storyline, than look for something like &#34;The Road&#34; instead.  Although The Hunger Games has a unique setting and plot, it is by no means a masterpiece.
