I was so excited for this book to come out. I preordered it months ago, and was counting down the days till it would arrive. But then, sadly, I really didn't like it. I can't say much without giving away some plot lines, but let's just say that I couldn't stand Katniss this time around, so it pretty much went downhill from there. Honestly, I wish I had never read it, so I could just make up my own ending to the story!
