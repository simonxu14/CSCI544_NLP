I read all three books right after the other and the 1st was great, 2nd ok and 3rd TERRIBLE.  There were so many loose ends that were just left hanging.  Half developed characters your thing?  Well read this b/c it's chocked full of them.  This is not a case of me not agreeing with the end, instead it's that this was not the end.  It was a cobbled together excuse to capitalize on readers who spent money on the 1st 2 and had to finish.  The author should be ashamed.  I want a refund:)
