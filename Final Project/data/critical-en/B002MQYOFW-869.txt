I was really trying to give this book 2.5 stars, I'm ok with 3 stars. In my opinion,  it was the worst out of all 3 books. For a while, I disliked Katniss for a bit throughout the book because of how she treated Peeta. I understood her actions, I just didn't like it. I also disliked the ending. I really don't want to get too in depth for the reasons why I partly disliked the end of the &#34;Hunger Games&#34; triology because I would be releasing too much of the story. I think the book should be purchased, it's just not my favorite.
