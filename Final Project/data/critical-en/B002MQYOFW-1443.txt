The first book in the series was great.  The second was pretty good.  This one was rotten.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins' considerable writing talent was wasted in this book.  She did a great job of helping the reader explore gore, paranoia, sadness, manipulation, violence and many other negative experiences that cause mental instability.  Who wants to become intimately familiar with so many depressing topics?  Not me.
