The way book two ended I would say Collins sets up her readers to expect a different book. And this one is different than either of the two before it. More political. More trauma. More emotional tug o war. If you expect and want these, then you will be happy. But the problem with this otherise good story is that the plot is structured so the reader anicpates and hungers for Katniss to be the active participant in a crucial event at a specific moment. Without giving anything away I will just warn you to expect the story to shift out of active and engaging scene when you don't want it to. Collins has her reasons (integrity of story and authorial purpose I suppose), but I am afraid those reasons deny the reader a more satisfying read. This type of ending is the epitome of conflicting desires: the author's and the reader's.
