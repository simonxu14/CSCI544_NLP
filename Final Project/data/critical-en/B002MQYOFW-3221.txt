While I cannot stand the Twilight books - I am not a huge fan of the Hunger Games books, either. I do not think the books were well written, I do not feel that most of the characters were developed, and I think the author dove into heavy subjects with little regard to the general YA audience. An example of this that comes to mind is how the author does not deal with morality the same from character to character and while, at 25 I understand the book is fiction, a young adult will certainly have problems. I hope that all parents that see their children reading these books will read them to be able to discuss the topics with them.<br /><br />I also did not like Katniss. I did not find her as a strong character (given, no one can portray a weak female lead as Stephanie Meyer does, "oh Edward, oh Edward - I cannot live without you!"). I did, however, love Peeta but I feel as if his character was not developed well, at all. I felt as if I barely knew him and it might be because it was written in present tense.<br /><br />Part of my negative analysis might have to do with the hype, that I expected too much. I have a feeling that my undying love for Lois Lowry's The Giver (a YA book that I read yearly) and Huxley's Brave New World (along with Orwell's 1984) has to do with my negative opinion. I am extremely interested in topics relating to a future society and I feel as if the Hunger Games left some gaping holes and could not hold up to these classics. (Gaping hole - you really want me to believe they'd have the ability to do invisible hovercrafts but not install better surveillance?)
