It may be that I expected too much. It may be that I'll end up liking these books. However, there are things illogical that do not belong in any book, fantasy or not, such as someone trying to pound a nail with fruit cake. I realize this book is for young people, but I agree with C. S. Lewis  who said, &quot;Any book that is not worthy of an adult, is not worthy of  children.&quot; There are even little picky things, such as using words  such as &quot;tap&quot; or &quot;wham,&quot; as if this is a comic strip.  Ms. Rowling has a marvelous imagination, but I could wish there had been a  bit more creative editing. You cannot know how disappointed I am in this  first volume of the series.
