I'm so sorry, but this book is actually terribly written.  I love the plot, it's just that Suzanne Collins is simply not a good writer!  Compare this with other writers like JK Rowling, and there's a world of difference.  The style of writing here is very short, very choppy, and very fragmented.  She may have been going for a stream-of-consciousness thing, but I just couldn't get into it and it was driving me nuts - it seemed liked a 3rd grader could have written this.<br /><br />This is one of the few times where I actually prefer the movies over the book, because I couldn't handle the writing style
