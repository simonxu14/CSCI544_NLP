After the first two books of the trilogy I could not wait to read Mockingjay. But, it was a big let down. The amount of dramatic dialog over the actual story was just too much. I found myself skipping pages as I tired of Kitness's constant internal struggle over anything and everything. The war itself went uncovered through most of the book so we just kept getting dropped into the action without really understanding how the rebels were being successful. I understand that the characters changed throughout the story, but they went through some pretty unusual directions.<br />The final chapters that led to the ending were unbelievable and instead of a build up to the final confrontation with the President it whimpered out.<br />Also can't that girl walk out the door without being severally wounded and having to spend time in the hospital.<br />As a whole the trilogy is a good read and will keep you entertained, but be prepared to walk away looking forward to the movie version so we can have the action of the first two books with an exciting finish.
