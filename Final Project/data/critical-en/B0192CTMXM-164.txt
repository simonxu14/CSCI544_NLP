My son is old enough to enjoy Harry, but not old enough to struggle through the book.  So when I had the opportunity to preorder the book on tape, I jumped on it!  He has the first 4 audiobooks and listens to a tape every night.  Not these tapes!  14 of the 17 tapes would not work!  It appears to be a spooling issue on 12 of them.  Before you play them, you should rewind, ffwd (it will stop after a couple of seconds), rewind, ffwd to the end, then rewind to the beginning. This pattern seemed to work for me on 12 of them.  On one there was  a loop(or kink) sticking out the side of the tape spool, and the last problem was the tape was glued upside down to the leader! (how in the world does that happen???)  Additionally I am a fan of audiobooks that state the chapter and side at the beginning of each tape, these don't.<br />It appears to me that this was simply an issue of trying to produce as many copies as possible, as quickly as possible, using the cheapest materials as possible with no quality assurance.<br />In order to avoid these issues, I would recommend purchasing the CD's.
