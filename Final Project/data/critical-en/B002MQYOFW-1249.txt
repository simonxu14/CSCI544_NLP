i read this trilogy because of the great reviews of the movie and people that have read the first book. book one was good. glad i read the book befor seeing the movie it gave me better knowledge of the characters. book two was ok, it took awhile to get my interest. very slow in the beginning, too much of a romance, about half way thru it picked up an got better. book three was ok as well. after reading the first two , you want to finish the series. i think its a teens, early twenties, type of reading, but i am much older and still enjoyed. not my usual type of reading,  i would reccomend this.
