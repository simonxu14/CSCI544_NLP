Imagine Bear Grylls turned into a modern Artemis and thrown in the midst of a love triangle with less zest (if that's even possible) than the other famous/infamous love triangle in the young adult genre (you know, the one that has furries, bloodsuckers and sparkles) and you'll have a fair picture of what "The Hunger Games" is all about. Lots of survival without any actual survival tricks, some hacking and slashing scenes cut short, loads of angst-driven interior monologue in a rather tame dystopia (if one dares compare this to "A Brave New World", "1984" or even "A Clockwork Orange", that is) and some rather interesting twists and turns which fall somewhat short in the end. A promising setting, a likable main character in the first book turned into a borefest in the sequels due to the pendulating nature of the said love triangle, a few dei ex machina which make you go "yeah, right...!" a number of times and least, but not last, the undeveloped and underused dystopian setting which, I humbly believe, could've provided a much stronger driving force behind the story than the oh-so-overused "they're evil and we must fight back the tyranny" card. All in all, blockbuster material, but don't expect to have quotes lying all over your desk after reading it.
