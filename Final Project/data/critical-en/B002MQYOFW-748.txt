I finished the first Hunger Games book yesterday (7/5/12) and I have to say - I didn't really care for it. I looked at my Kindle at 40% and nearly just said 'Forget it' - and I rarely dump books, but I bought all three books at once due to the fact that so many friends raved about the movie and books - so I kept plowing through. Finally around 60% it picked up. I'm sure I'll be burned at the stake for not falling over the book like everyone else. I've not seen the movie, but I'm afraid this may be one of the rare times the movie is better than the book. We'll see when it hits Blu-Ray. I'm now 40% through the second book - it is better than the first so far so I'm glad I forced my way through Book 1. Surely I'm not the only reader who had a hard time with the half-post-apocolyptic half-Willy-Wonka book?
