I rarely write reviews, but the experience I had pushed me to do so! I ordered this book because it came with the 2-day shipping. The book was classified as &#34;Like New&#34; but it had torn pages, the cover was really worn. This book should have been labeled as acceptable! I was extremely disappointed!!!!
