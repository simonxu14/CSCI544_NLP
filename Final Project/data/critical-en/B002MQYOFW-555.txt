I was suprised about this one. I could barely put the first two books down and felt that until about 3/4 of the way in, this book didn't have the same feel. Except that the characters were the same, this almost seemed like it cold have been part of another series or a spin-off to the HG books. I I really wasn't as big of a fan this time out.
