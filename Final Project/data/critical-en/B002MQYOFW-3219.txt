For those people who believe it was a great book because it was realistic I ask, what is wrong with you? The whole book is a series of crappy things happening and at the end the author tries to "put a frown upside" by making it so that two of the main characters get together and have kids. I hate books that are tragic throughout the whole thing and at the end try to put a smile on it by letting two people get together. Everyone else has died, if she is going to make it tragic, the least the author could do was kill off everyone or every except the main character. It was a horrible book what is the point of reading a book or watching a movie if you can't escape reality for a bit?? Instead of feeling glad you read the book after you're done you just end up feeling drained because they killed off some of the best and most innocent characters. It's sad when we have people in our world who come up with these kind of books or movies. If you ask me, this is why crappy things happen in reality because we have so many people in the world who thrive on books like this.
