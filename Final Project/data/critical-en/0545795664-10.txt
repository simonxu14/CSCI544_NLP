this NOT a comprehensive guide to anything, and you should know that before buying.  What it is:  an encyclopedia of basic pokemon, with lots of art and some details as to the where the fictional characters come from and minimal details on fighting styles.  What it is MISSING is information about pokemon types, energy, weakness, resistances, attacks, or strategy about playing pokemon.  The cover is misleading as NONE of the stats in this book are &#34;need to know.&#34;  If you want a cute canon of the little creatures, this book is for you.  If you need actually &#34;need to know stats&#34; for playing pokemon, keep looking.
