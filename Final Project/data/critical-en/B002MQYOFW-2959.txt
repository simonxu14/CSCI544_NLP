I read this based on recommendations from a few other people saying it was a "fast read". Yes it was, because I couldn't wait to get to the end. I got hooked after a few pages and was all set for a good ride, but I just couldn't wait for it to end. While it started off well, by the end, I felt like I was reading one of those "bodice ripper" novels. Blah. I know everyone has an opinion, likes and dislikes, but I seem to be very out of sync with most other reviewers. I'm not tempted to subject myself to the next two installments, even though they are in my library (purchased by a family member, who also couldn't wait for it to end, but had more perseverance than I.) The whole premise of a strong, independent girl, unravels fast with insipid romantic notions thrown at us by the author. I felt manipulated and wished the author had developed the main character based on her initial character strengths, instead of subjecting her to the silliness of a predictable romance novel. A nice beginning, but very predictable end.
