first half of the book is really good. second half (once they get the capitol if i'm not spoiling too much there) is mediocre.<br /><br />i really started disliking katniss; she's wining and selfish.<br /><br />i've seen a trend in books lately where there is no real conclusion to the story and i feel this way about this book as well. at least one whole chapter please dedicated to wrapping things up. i didn't read three books to draw my own conclusions; i want a finish to the story and the couple lines we were fed i did not find satisfying even though i was happy for the way it ended.<br /><br />for example (SPOILERS) after she killed coin she's taken away. okay i'm thinking this is going to be good, their going to realize the monster coin really was and how she wanted another hunger games and instead i get another whole chapter about katniss being drugged and sad. i've had enough of katniss being drugged and sad. i wanted the trial! that would have been the interesting part. then peeta; all we get is the bush digging, making the book, and a paragraph about them ending up together? hated it.<br /><br />it just seemed lazy and i liked the first two a lot. maybe the movies will be better. i haven't seen the first one yet.
