Honestly, I didn't like Mockingjay. I felt that Suzanne Collins wasted a lot of the book over insignificant details and things that didn't mean much and left out a lot of explaining towards the end. I loved The Hunger Games and Catching Fire SO much and honestly expected a lot more from Mockingjay. It's emotionally draining and I felt as though Suzanne could have done a much better job at writing this book compared to the two previous books.
