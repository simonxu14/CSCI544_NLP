This book was supposed to be the grand finale of the series, but it turned into a train wreck instead. The storyline meanders pointlessly, plot twists become red herrings, beloved characters become caricatures and the final showdown between Harry and Voldemort packs the emotional punch of a hallmark card. It's awful. It's so awful, in fact, that when Ron finally packs up and deserts Harry part way through, I wanted to go with him. Diehard Harry Potter fans will read this book anyway, but I suggest taking a "Defense Against Deadly Bad Writing" class first!
