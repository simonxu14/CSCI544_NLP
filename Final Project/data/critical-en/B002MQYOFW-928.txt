Even thought the first two books were great when I was reading this one it wasn't my favorite. I wish that Katniss wasn't in the hospital so much I wish she played a stronger role to show everyone that she can over come what has happen to her in the past. And also prim dying in the very ending of the book was very depressing it made me want to put the book down and not even pick it back up.
