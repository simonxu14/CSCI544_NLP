This book starts out fast passed and then goes to sleep after the first chapter and never wakes up.  Honestly it reminds me of a really reminded me of the middle of StarTrek the movie when they encounter Voyager and are stuck on the ship.  Great action before and after, but not this book.  It was a total waste after the first chapter.  Save your money here and on the later movie.
