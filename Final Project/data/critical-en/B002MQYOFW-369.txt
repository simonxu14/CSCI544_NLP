Okay, I'm in my 50s so maybe I'm not the best one to review a book series classified as &#34;YA.&#34; But these stories have been spoken of as &#34;new classics,&#34; and classics should be accessible to any age, which I figure entitles me to an opinion.<br /><br />Overall story--a cross between old Roman gladiator games and new dystopian future reality shows. And the sad thing is, it doesn't seem that far in the future, or that big a step from where we are now in reality television.<br /><br />Book 1 is impossibly good. The writing is plain-jane minimalist, but that's okay. The story is fascinating. It's full of twists and turns. The characters, especially Peeta and Cinna, are well-developed. Katniss, the protagonist and narrator, is a little harder to figure, but that may be because she doesn't know herself that well. The only problem with the book is that it's never quite made clear whether the &#34;berry stunt&#34; (Katniss and Peeta threatening a double-suicide rather than try to kill each other) at the end was a bluff on Katniss' part or whether she meant to go through with it. In either case, though, it's the berry bit that makes the next two books necessary.<br /><br />Book 2 lets us know that things in Panem (the thinly disguised country that the US has become) is not as subdued as we were led to believe--there is a resistance building up. People in the districts are hovering on rebellion, and Katniss and Peeta inadvertently spur them on. The Hunger Games &#34;show&#34; intended to punish them instead makes Katniss a bigger hero than before, and Peeta's sacrifice turns him into a government mouthpiece in part 3.<br /><br />Book 3 pulls out all stops. There is no more Hunger Games; this is rebellion. And Katniss finds herself leading it, although as usual her only real objectives are to keep her family safe and keep Peeta out of danger. With the stakes so high, it's unbelievable that the book should run out of steam, but it does. Maybe it's because, as some have already suggested, Peeta's absence for most of the book throws everything out of balance. Peeta was always the light and sweet to Katniss' dark and acid, and although Gale, the guy we're supposed to believe Katniss really loved all along, is too bland, too boring, too uncomplicated, and of course too inadvertently (yup, same word...stuff just seems to happen to these characters while they have no idea what they're doing) implicated in the death of Katniss' sister to be a valid love interest after all, or even to be a good balancing point. And what's worst of all is that the &#34;good guys,&#34; that is to say the organized resistance movement in District 13, turn out to be led by a guy (woman) who's really just as bad as the bad guys, which kind of makes the reader (or at least me) throw their hands up and wonder who we're supposed to root for now. Then to just frost it, after all the frap everyone has been through, the book winds down to one of those &#34;and a good time was had by all&#34; endings that makes everything murkier than it already was.<br /><br />I'm not sorry I read it, but I wish it had ended better.
