I really liked the first two books... This one ended up feeling a bit forced and unrealistic. I feel like it went a bit more on the girly side with the love and drama, whereas the first book was really more of an action adventure kind of book. But, that's a personal opinion. You won't hate it, and it's an ok conclusion to the series, but don't expect the same style as the first book.
