The first two books of this series I literally inhaled. I couldn't sleep because at the end of each chapter a hook would be drawn out and I'd have to keep reading. As I dove into this book, I was expecting the same exhilarating suspense that make me stay up all night reading the last two, but it just wasn't there. I think the author's path was actually a good one and I think her plot was thoughtful, though I know some people were looking for something lighter. The author just crammed it all together in this somewhat difficult to understand blob instead of drawing it out slowly like the last books.<br /><br />Anyone who is a writer will tell you that the end is the hardest part to write and that's why so many authors seem to screw up even the best books at the end. Either the book gets rushed as the author tries to tie up all the loose ends and get across the main message of the book (especially this one where the real message only comes out towards the end), or the author drags it out way past the reader's attention span so you find yourself skimming to get to the resolution (like Breaking Dawn, which seemed to be the least edited book to ever be published).<br /><br />Long story short: The plot is good and the message is good, and the overall series is fantastic. This book is the weak link and not the greatest writing, but it served its purpose and tied it all up.
