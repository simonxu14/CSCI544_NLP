I enjoyed the books. I felt Katniss could of been developed better, and so could Gale in the last book. I felt Collins spent to much time trying with trying to be descriptive of the battle and the Capital and ended up with to repeating herself.<br /><br />The ending of the book felt rushed, and I felt could she could of expanded upon the outcome.
