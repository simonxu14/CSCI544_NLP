The Hunger Games was an enjoyable story, drawing heavily on a clever combination of teenage angst, "Survivor", "MacGyver" and even "Highlander."  We cheered for Katniss, who was distinguished from the other competitors by her self-sacrifice and her skill with a bow, fighting against seemingly impossible odds.<br /><br />But as the story continues through the second and third books, we realize that Katniss is an unlikeable anti-hero.  She is revealed as a narcissistic sociopath; a trained murderer.  All of her decisions are made without thinking, and instead are based purely on emotion and instinct.<br /><br />There is nothing to enjoy in Mockingjay.  I had to force myself to finish the book, in the vain hope that some twist in the story would make it worthwhile. I suppose the author was trying to make a point, such as "war is bad", or "humans are bad and should be replaced by some other species" (a point expressed several times in the story).  Okay, fine, if that's your opinion, but it doesn't make for an enjoyable book.<br /><br />And by this third book, a critical plot device becomes laughable.  In this world several hundred years in the future, why does the powerful Capitol insist on LIVE broadcasting?  You know by the third book that every time the Capitol goes on the air, it is with a LIVE broadcast in which something goes very wrong.  Gee, if only these technologically advanced people knew about TAPE DELAY, then they could have edited their broadcasts and there would have been no rebellion.<br /><br />I should have been satisfied with the first book in the series, and not have wasted my time and money with the second and third books.
