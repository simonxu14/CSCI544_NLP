I loved books 1-4, but it seems Rowling wants to be considered a "serious" writer, and ended up writing abook more for her peers (which weren't authors when the series began, but commonfolk).  Specifically the book had two major flaws 1) plot flaws and 2) overly explanatory writing.<br /><br />1) Dumbledore stated at the end of this book that he has the ability to tell if someone is lying.  Yet in book 4, the teacher he hired "Mad Eye Moody", wasn't the one who showed up at school, but an imposter.  This low-level death eater lied to Dumbledore for an entire school year and he was none the wiser.<br /><br />Another plot error was when this low-level death eater ended up snagging Harry Potter right out from under the nose of Dumbledore, whose very presence at Hogwarts is supposed to protect Harry.  But this nobody beat Dumbledore's magic to get Harry's name into the triwizard tournament AND he then modified the winning trophy to transport two students right to Voldemort - where one of them died.<br /><br />Sure if that was Voldemort then I could see the argument, but some kid who got caught when he was 18, sent to Azkaban where he hasn't practiced magic for 12 years, then shows up and pulls the wool right over Dumbledore - that's a joke.<br /><br />2) The entire book was filled with uneccessary "descriptive" information.  Situations that had nothing to do with plot development, though arguably character development (but not quality character development).  Situations that make Harry look more like an ass than a real boy going through adolescence.  His stunning lack of concern for Cho Chang is prevalent thoughout the book.  Harry has almost no compassion or empathy for her, but the very wonderfulness of Harry is that he's just happy being a wizard, now she's trying to turn him into some dark hero, and doing a rather poor job of it.  The best she can come up with is "It's hard being Harry".<br /><br />The first four books, in this order:<br /><br />Sorcerer's Stone: ***** (5)<br /><br />Chamber Secrets: ***** (5)<br /><br />Prisoner of Azkaban: **** (4)<br /><br />Goblet of Fire: ***** (5)<br /><br />Order of the Phoenix: ** (2)
