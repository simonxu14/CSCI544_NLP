I LOVED the first two books (so much, that I couldn't wait for the plane to land after finishing book #1 so I could buy #2 at the (overpriced) airport bookstore. #3 is still good, and takes you on quite a journey, but I really felt the "tone" of the book changed. I don't want to give away any spoilers, and if you've made it through #1 and #2, I know you won't even question getting this one! It just wasn't as addicting... I finished the first two in a period of maybe 5 days, and this last one took me a week - I just wasn't as caught up in the story.
