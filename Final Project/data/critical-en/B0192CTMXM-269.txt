How I looked forward to this book!  For over a year, everyone at work and my kids and I speculated what would happen?  Would Harry die?  Was he a horcrux?  Would Voldemort really die or just be shelved in case she wanted to pick up the series again?  How would she end the series so it really was finished?  You get the idea. Unfortunately, I found the writing mechanical and did not feel the kinship with the characters that I've always found in the past.  I was almost 1/4 into the book before I really started to enjoy it.  I felt the plot was too predictable.  The "dream-like" segment near the end seemed very Bob Newhart to me.  Worked for him...  AND, JK Rowling or her editor committed the most heinous crime of all series writers.  I feel very strongly that any book in a seriers should be able to stand on its own.  It might be better if one's read the whole series, but one ought to be able to pick up any one of the books and understand it without having read the others.  I was always impressed that JK Rowling did such a good job of this in the past.  With this book, however, there was no explanation, no introduction, nothing.  You were out of luck if you had not read book 6.  Years from now, some kid in some library is going to pick up this book, the only one of the series in at the time, be hopelessly confused, and decide they are dumb books.  He or she will then miss out on the some of the greatest books for kids, and adults, every written, minus one.  At the very least, when this book hits its next printing, there should be a prologue bringing the uninitiated up to date.  I really should have given it a 2 but couldn't bring myself to do so.
