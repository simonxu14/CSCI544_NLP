It did not meet my expectations at all.  I though I was buying an audio book.  That's what I had put in the search engine to look for at Amazon.  And ended up with a book I did not want.  Why did I keep trying to buy from you?  It is not the first time there has been a mix up in what I ordered and what I got.
