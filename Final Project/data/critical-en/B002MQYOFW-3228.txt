The first book in this trilogy asks us to accept a very disturbing premise, that is, a Game within a futuristic society which requires children to fight each other to the death.  I found this difficult to live with as I read the first two books but I was compelled to read on by the heroic and moral behaviour of the lead character.  She shone in this terrible world. However, the third book is a rushed, jumble of confused events where the characters are killed off or dispatched in a mad scramble to get to the last page and our heroine becomes a whining shadow of her former self.  Even the romantic plot fizzles out as the love triangle becomes a "make do" arrangement. Consequently the huge emotional investment that the reader must make in the original premise of the trilogy is simply not worth it.  It becomes a shabby cheap trick which left this reader wishing I had never gone to that dark place.
