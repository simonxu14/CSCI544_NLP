There was no ending to this book, not a final ending anyway.  It is going to be a series and if I had known I would've waited to read it.  The story was very good and I would have given it a great review if it had properly ended.  I do not like to be left hanging.  I purchased this book because it was recommended by Stephenie Meyer.  That's twice she's left me hanging (1/2 of Midnight Sun anyone...), but I can't seem to stop following her.
