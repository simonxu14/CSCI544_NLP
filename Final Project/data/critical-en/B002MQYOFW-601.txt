There are thousands of reviews that have already been written about the Hunger Games series.  I enjoyed the first book quite a bit, the second one, not as much and actually struggled to get through the third book and don't plan to re-read any of them.  After all the hype and the movies coming out, I wanted to know what they were about.<br /><br />Initially, the overall theme seemed good,  although on further thought it is pretty contrived.  It is hard to believe, that a city like Panem could maintain control of its districts for over seventy-five years with the barbarism shown in the Hunger Games.  Children in any society are among its most prized possessions and while people might tolerate pain, famine and other suffering from themselves personally, to see their children taken year after year to feed Panem's insatiable thirst for blood, without response is inconceivable.<br /><br />The style of writing is frustrating as well.  There are so many fragments of sentences floating around, that meaning is sometimes lost or, difficult to parse.  I understand using this as a way of bringing an urgency to a tense situation, like in the Battle Arenas, but it just makes reading difficult in the middle.  I liked the first book enough that I dealt with it.  By the third book, it was old and just flat out irritating.<br /><br />The main character, Katniss, is pretty devoid of motivation in this book. The first book, she is motivated by love of her sister, the second book, by a desire to protect Peeta, but in this book, there just isn't anything except for hatred of President Snow.  Which is something, but it doesn't really drive her to do anything until the very end of the book.  In point of fact, Katniss isn't really even that important to this book.  The author could have killed her off in the first chapter and then written a book called "Assault on Panem" that would have been more interesting.  Even Katniss's actions towards the end of the book don't seem to have any real impact on anything, except to kill of some of the characters around her.  The end is forseen from the beginning, but it sure is a slog to get there.<br /><br />The love triangle really falls apart in this book.  I'm not quite sure why it was ever there in the first place, except that Katniss and Gale have hunting in common and hung out a lot together.  Otherwise, he isn't a very interesting character and there certainly isn't much sizzle going on in the first place.  As time goes by, it becomes pretty clear that he is very much an "ends justify the means" sort of person, who is willing to do what it takes to win the war, at whatever cost of human life.  He's just not much of a love-interest, though.<br /><br />Which brings the fact that the one likeable character in the whole series, Peeta, is all but killed off for the majority of the book.  He just doesn't exist.  And without his humor, positive out look, and deep inner-good, all you're left with is an intense, somewhat unstable Katniss to wallow in her own fears and depression.<br /><br />Perhaps the goal of the author was to convey that in war, there is no "good side," that both sides are busy with their propaganda machines and are willing to waste lives, even of their own citizens, in order to achieve victory.  Certainly, Katniss is nothing more than a tool in this book of a different spin-machine.<br /><br />I guess I would recommend reading this book, if you need to know how things turn out, but if you are OK with letting your imagination fill things in, you are probably better off letting it go.
