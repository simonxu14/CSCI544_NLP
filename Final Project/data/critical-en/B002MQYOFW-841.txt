So everyone I know who is a reader was reading or has read this book.  I decided to give it a try on my new Kindle (that I love by the way).  I don't like scary movies and I don't read sci-fi but i was curious.  I do have to admit...I wanted to know how it ended but it was pretty violent and graphic.  I am glad I read it but I am not in any rush to read about the end of humanity as we know it.  It is just too much of a downer for me.  Kids killing kids because they are forced to by the goverment.  I get the BIG picture but choose to ignore it.  Real life is tough enough for so many and this just was too weird for me and too depressing.  I will leave the other 2 books for the big sci-fi folks.  I do have to say however that I could picture everything that Ms. Collins was writing about and I think that was half the problem for me.Thanks.
