This book, as other reviewers said, is unnecessarily long. Until page 450 or so, all we get is a retelling of what we already knew with very little action. And even when a new story begins it moves so slowly you have to keep yourself from yawning or giving up.<br />My biggest complaint has to do with the "shocking and painful death". If I blinked I would have missed it. The method of death doesn't appear to be a method at all. In fact, unless other characters said the victim had died I wouldn't know it. Some suggest that gives it a realistic feeling as death is often sudden, tragic and shockingly ubelievable. But that is a rationalization. I would have prefered a body or more realistic death circumstance.<br />Another missed opportunity was Snape's development. Harry had a perfect opportunity to understand the adults in his life better, but instead he absorbs himself in his own selfish concerns. He does not appear heroic, not even smart.<br />The sad thing is this is nothing more than a filler book. It moves the whole story arc along very little. Yet we still have another 2 years to wait for another story.
