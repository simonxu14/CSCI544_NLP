Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J. K. Rowling<br /><br />Am I missing something?  I don't get why this book is so popular, and why it appeals to anyone over the age of 14 (or to parents of someone in that age range).  I get why kid's like it - the characters are at a sorcery school and have the same daily responsibilities of homework and such.  The main character doesn't fit in with his family, is abused and unappreciated, and one day finds out that he's special and world renowned.<br /><br />Yes, it is fantasy: there are dragons, unicorns, and trolls in the story.  Vampires and werewolves are even mentioned in passing.  Yet, for a book about wizards and witches, there is surprisingly little magic.  I expected guys shooting fireballs and lightning, or teleporting.  Instead, they float feathers and cast a spell called "leg locker curse."  I've seen more impressive magic tricks at a David Copperfield show.  I guess I was thinking something along the lines of the superpowers in X-Men or the video game Diablo.<br /><br />The first part establishes that Harry's foster family treats him horribly.  Then he goes off to sorcery school with the good guys (Ron, Hermione) and the bad guys (Malfoy and Snape).  They even separate the two sides into different "houses": Gryffindor and Sytherin, respectively.  The characters are all flat - look at Dudley for a good example.<br /><br />The main characters sneak around playing detective, always arriving at just the right time to overhear an incriminating conversation.  But, these children are maddeningly careless.  That is, they're so careless to the point of making the story unbelievable.  Ron inexplicably gives his sworn enemy Malfoy a book with a top-secret letter inside it, not realizing his folly until much later.  The letter, mind you, was easy to remember; if he had an ounce of common sense, he would've destroyed it after reading it.  Further, Harry has a magical invisibility cloak that he miraculously decides to leave at the top of a tower after he is sneaking around at night, and he gets caught because of it.<br /><br />The book is well written, and doesn't drag.  However, it's just not all that entertaining.  I really liked the mini-story about the Mirror of Erised (Desire), that would show you whatever you wanted, which reminds me of the Sirens from Homer's Odyssey.  I will admit that the ending was good, especially with the enchanted booby-trapped rooms.  Overall, I would say it is worth reading, but not anything special.
