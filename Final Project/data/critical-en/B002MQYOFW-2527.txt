OK. I ordered this book becauuse of the great reviews. Thousands of people love it but I HATE it! I got just over 80 pages in before I decided that I should give it away to a teenager. The story is fine. The writing is horrendous and the entire story could have been condensed to at least half the number of pages that were used. Also there was not a single character that I found relatable. I was in nobodies corner... Horrible book
