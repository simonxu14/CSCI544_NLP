I did not know that Book II / Catching Fire (2009) and Book III / Mockingjay (2010) were not yet released in paperback editions.  Only The Hunger Games (2008) Book I has been released in paperback edition.  Amazon misleads the buyer by not stating Book II and III are published by a different publisher other than Scholastic and it comes in Large Print.  If you like Large Print then it might be worth you money, for myself I am returning all three books UPS and heading over to Barnes & Noble tonight and buying the all three books in hardcover editions.
