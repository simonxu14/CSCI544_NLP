What an action packed story! Loved it! However...<br />Die beginning starts of very slow and I had to keep myself focussed to stay in the story.<br />The rest of the plot is awesome, yet extremely gruesome. None of the characters are safe which promises for edge-of-your-seat reading. After rushing to get to the end I was bitterly disappointed with how it ended. After so much action and twists the end is SUPER boring and watered down. Not even romantic, but rather platonic. Hopefully the movie version will fix it.
