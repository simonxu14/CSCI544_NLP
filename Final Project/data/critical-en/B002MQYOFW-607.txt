1. Prim survives the final attack and goes on to be an amazing doctor.<br />2. Katniss chooses to be with Peeta - really chooses to be with him, not because it's inevitable.<br />3. Gale eventually gets over Katniss.<br />4. Finnick doesn't die in the tunnels. Maybe he gets badly injured but survives to return to Annie and his son.<br />5. Haymitch struggles with his addiction but gets help from Katniss and her family.<br />6. Katniss mends her relationship with her mother. War makes them grow closer, not apart.<br /><br />I know war does terrible things to people. But I would've still liked this story to end with hope. It sort of did - but there wasn't enough hope to satisfy me.
