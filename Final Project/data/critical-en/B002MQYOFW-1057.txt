After seeing the first 2 films (which are excellent by the way) I thought I might read the 3rd book. Maybe it's because I'm a 21 years old male, but the book is just to 'girly' for me. And I also think it's not written for adults. Nevertheless I think it would be great for a 14 year old girl. But not for me. I'll just wait another year for the third movie :)<br />PS: English is not my first language, so I apologize if I made a lot of mistakes
