It is my fault for not reading the information clearly. I did not know that I was ordering a used set of books for a Christmas gift. I assumed I would be getting a brand new set.. I have learned my lesson and will read more carefully in the future. I would have NEVER purchased this had I known it was used.... I have no problem with used books but I do when it is a Christmas present.
