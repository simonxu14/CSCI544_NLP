Hunger Games paints a metaphor of an existence where government has such control over the life's of its citizens they decide who lives and dies.  They are not so daring as to kill citizens in mass and provoke open revolt, instead yearly they take from among the young, the best of their lot and pit them in a life and death contest. Only a sole survivor lives. Viewing this contest is mandatory for all citizens.<br /> It's really a story about man's inhumanity towards their fellow man. A story that warns when man gains too much control over the life of others they will abuse that sometimes to the extreme, as exampled by our own history and the brutality we inflicted on the slaves at the birth of this nation.<br />  Hunger Games begs the reader to ponder what life really means and to consider that Golden Rule, " Do Unto Others As You Would Have Others Do Unto Your"  Yet is written is such a fresh, youthful way that it was destined to be a best seller among sci fi fans.
