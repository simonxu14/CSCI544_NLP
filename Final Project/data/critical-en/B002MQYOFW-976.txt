I am sorry to be a downer but this book did not turn out as I expected. Katniss, my role model in the first 2 books is a mess. She was this strong, independent woman, now she can't get her thoughts straight. I know she has been through a lot, but she needs to get a hold of herself. This book was not HORRIBLY terrible, but definitely not what I expected Katniss to turn into.
