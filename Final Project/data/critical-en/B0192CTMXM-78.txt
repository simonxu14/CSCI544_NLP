I apologize for the clich&eacute;d title, but it felt most appropriate and says it all. This is definitely a three-star book as far as the rest of ther series goes.<br /><br />As others have written in their reviews (and I won't repeat specifics here because many contained spoilers) much of the book could have been edited down. The book positively plodded along aimlessly in many sections (a "Deathly" bore, as I told someone). The plot really didn't get interesting until the last quarter of the book, then went tragically fast.<br /><br />However, it was a solid ending to the series, and I think other hard-core fans like myself were satisfied in the end, if a little disappointed with the story development.<br /><br />However, there was one mystery that has nagged me for a couple of years (and I am certainly not the first or last to ask it): What ever happended to Florian Fortescue?!?<br /><br />I guess some mysteries will have to remain so.
