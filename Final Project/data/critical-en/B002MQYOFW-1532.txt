After falling in love with the first book and finding a lot of positive things about the second, the concluding book in the trilogy left me stranded.  I didn't care about the characters anymore.  With so much collusion, trickery, and deceit, I simply lost interest.  Who wants to kill whom and why?  That gets really old after awhile.  The first book was stunning.  I was drawn into the morality and sociology of the concepts, etc.  But the third book is just trying to make sense of paranoia.  Not a strong ending for what could have been brilliant.
