I loved the first book, liked the second and loathed the third. I did read the reviews first but I always give a book a try no matter what. I just can't believe I even made it to the end of this book. There were so many loose ends that never were tied together which would make a reader at the end scratch their heads wondering what happened or flip back through the already read pages wondering if there was something they missed. It's like the author was so over writing that she left her imagination in the last two books and just went for it on this book. There were so many things that could have made this book so much better,  its very sad it had to end the way it did.
