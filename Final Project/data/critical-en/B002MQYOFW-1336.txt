After spending all day reading Mockingjay I am finally finished. I think I need some more time to process what I just read but I thought I'd offer my initial reaction, for what it's worth. Let me preface this by saying that anything I say about the novel is going to be a spoiler. So, I am going to try to write a review without any spoilers, which is quite a task. The thing that I can't seem to get out of my mind is the shift in tone at Chapter 25. The whole novel just takes a shift and it felt very bizarre, unnatural and unexpected. With only fifty pages left in the novel I got the impression that Collins felt she needed to hurry up and wrap things up. I've said this before and I'll say it again, I am not a fan of epilogues. I find them unnecessary and offensive, because the author is assuming the reader has no imagination. When, I reached the end I groaned to see that, yes an epilogue was included.<br />Getting past the parts I didn't care for I could never hate Mockingjay. Collins made me so emotionally attached to Katniss that any ending of the series would have pleased me. I think the book was well written and examined human relationships, which is when the series is at it's finest. All in all, it wasn't a bad way to spend a summer day.
