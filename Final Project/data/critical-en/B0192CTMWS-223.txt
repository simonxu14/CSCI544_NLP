I found this a perfectly rotten end to the series. In this book the author managed to strip out all the wit, humor and charm which marked the earlier books. All that went out the window from the pointless death of Hedwig the owl to the other deaths of well-loved characters from the earlier books -- Mad-Eye Moody, Fred Weasley etc. Sure Harry Potter lived and we had a stupid epilogue (aka happy ending) but basically this books was just too negative all the way through. I know it was meant to be dark but it didn't have to lose its wit and humor on the way. The author needs to figure how to write a decent end to the series and try again. This book manages to spoil the entire series.
