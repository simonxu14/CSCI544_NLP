There was a lot of things going on in this book, it was kind of hard to keep track of everything.  And Katniss spent so much time AWAY from Peeta and WITH Gale, I was afraid she would end up with Gale.  I didn't like how she just left it up to everyone else to get Peeta's mind healed.  She pretty much just walked out on him.  I know it was because she couldn't bear the thought of him hating her, and it hurt her to be around him, but he would never have done that to her.  I just wanted to smack her a couple of times.  And FINNICK DIED???  Really???  Annie couldn't even take care of herself, and now she has a baby to take care of too?  That was just really terrible.  Finnick paid his dues, many times over, to the Capitol, he should have been allowed to be happy.  I wish there had been more about the relationship of Peeta and Katniss, once they were both back at the Victor's Village.  It would have been nice to see how they struggled along to get back to being together, and to watch Katniss realize she DID love Peeta; instead of just hearing it at the end.
