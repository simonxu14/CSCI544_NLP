First book is excellent. Second is OK. Third is terrible. The direction the series took ended up making it one of the least enjoyable and most irritating series I've read. The rating is only as good as it is, because the first book is a 5, the next and is a 3, and the last is a 1. But when you finish out so poorly, it just leaves a bad taste in your month.
