I'm giving it 1 star to balance out what I think is the unworthy praise. I'd actually rate it a 2.5 or 3 at best.<br /><br />The book has an interesting setting and premise, but does little with it. I forced myself to read it due to the high reviews and high recommendations, but it really isn't much of a page-turner. The events lack imagination. The descriptions are boring. The story is highly predictable. The main character has little personality. This is just another Twilight for the sheep.
