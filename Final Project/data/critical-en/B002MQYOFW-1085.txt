the book was fine. but towards the end it started to get really weird. like to many new aspects were brought in that didnt exist in the previous books. such as their technology. and theres to much fluff towards the end to. over all it was good to have gotten through al the 3 books in the series. but i hope the movie for the 3rd book makes the second half of it a little more interesting
