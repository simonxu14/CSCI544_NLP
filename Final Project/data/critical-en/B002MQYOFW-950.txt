Suzanna Collins weaves a great, original story with the Hunger Games trilogy.  The first book captures the reader and leaves you wanting more.  The storyline in the second and third books could have been shortened and combined into one great book.  Instead Collins drags out the story with endless hand-wringing as the main characters wrestle with their decisions.  Although I loved the story overall, I found the writing tedious by the end of the third book.
