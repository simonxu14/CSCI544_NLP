Although I am a huge fan of this series, I was disappointed with the final book, Mockingjay. I feel as though Suzanna Collins did such a great job with the story buildup in the first two books and the beginning of the third, but the ending was abrupt and rushed. Throughout the series the reader sees Katniss staying loyal and staying true to herself and to her beliefs but by the end of the third book Katniss seems to have lost all of those wonderful qualities because of all of the heartache and difficulty she has endured. To me it was hard to see what the author was going for, and the great moral of the story, that was included in both books one and two, seems to disappear by the conclusion of the third novel. Seem to me like Suzanne Collins rushed to finish the ending when there's no reason she needed to! She's making millions of dollars off this series, she could've concluded it better!
