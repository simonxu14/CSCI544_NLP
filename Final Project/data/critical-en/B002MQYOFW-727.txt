To be honest, I was disappointed in this final book. I feel like the first book was great, unparalleled in quality and story to anything else in the market. However, with each addition there is a stark decline. I believe this should have been a one-off rather than a series. I know that any publisher and often writer is tantalized by the dollars that can be made from a popular franchise, but I think there need to be books that stand alone. No one would make a sequel to Lord of the Flies or 1984 and expect them to be anywhere as good as the first. Not only that, but it would sully the originals.<br /><br />The second book, Catching Fire, is decent, but not amazing, and this final chapter is not all that stellar at all. Not to spoil it for everyone, but lots of people die, most of the main characters, in fact, and the story doesn't gain anything from it. It's difficult to believe that Katniss is even on the sort of quest that she's on, and it feels like Collins is simply trying to stretch out the story for the sake of creating a third book in a trilogy. The love triangle is boring and tired as a level of complexity for the plot, and it's been played out for way too long. I definitely recommend the first book, and could go either way on the second, but don't recommend this third book at all. Don't bother reading it unless you need finality to the story.<br /><br />-Lindsey Miller, Lindsey's Library
