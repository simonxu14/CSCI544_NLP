The Hunger Games generally reminds me of nearly every teenage girl I ever met. That being said, I believe Candice is wonderfully written, as well as Gale and Peata. I really enjoyed the first book, didn't much care for the second and avoided reading this book for nearly two years. I will say that book three was better than two, but neither was as good as one. I feel that the story was told in book one, the remaining books were a result of greed rather than art. You can't have too much of a good thing because it ceases to be good when you get too much. I hope all the young ladies out there are happy about the ending. I was pulling for the other guy.
