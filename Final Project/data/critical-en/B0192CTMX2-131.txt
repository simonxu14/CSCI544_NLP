This was the worst one yet.  I was really looking forward to getting this book and it was a big let down.  The important stuff wasn't explained in detail but all of the trivial stuff was.  What's up with that?  I could care less about half the stuff she drags on and on about.  It almost seemed like she was just trying to make the book longer.  The ending was good but not very well explained.<br />Good luck staying interested in this one!
