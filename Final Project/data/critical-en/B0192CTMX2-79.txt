Hmmm... I liked it a lot, not sure I loved it. Nothing much different, and the usual big "good vs evil" scene towards the end is definitely kind of stale.<br />But I read it straight through, enjoyed it enough, and can't wait for the next one.<br />I do hope we haven't seen the last of Fred and George, though!
