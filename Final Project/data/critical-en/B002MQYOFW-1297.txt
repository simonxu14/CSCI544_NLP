Let me just say that if you don't sit and think too much about the story, then it's fantastic!  I've had a bit to think about it though and I'm kind of disappointed.<br /><br />***SPOILERS***<br /><br />In this book I expected Katniss to have grown leaps and bounds.  Especially by the time her mission to the Capitol begins.  That hasn't happened.  She seems to be the same pawn she started out being.  Only now instead of being the Capitol's pawn (as all of the tributes were) she's the rebel's pawn.<br />The end of the book, the thing we wait practically the whole series for..... Snow's death.  It's completely taken away from Katniss and from ME!!!  I had so many different ideas of how this could happen.  When I read it my jaw just dropped.  What an anticlimactic way to go.  I don't know if it's because Katniss can tell Snow is dying or if she's being manipulated by him or what.  Unfortunately, it feels like the later.<br />The the last page... really, that's how we find out who Katniss chooses.  It felt like a last minute addition to an already finished book.  The last 2 or 3 chapters felt completely rushed.  I would've loved for the book to be another 50 pages or so and feel like this part wasn't a complete afterthought.  I'm complaining a lot, I know.  After the first 2 books I guess my expectations were just too high to be delivered on.  :(
