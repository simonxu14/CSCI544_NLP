Just not a satisfying ending to the trilogy.  The first two books were full of twists and turns, but the last one was just predictable and boring.  I finished it only because I was waiting for more than just the main character falling to pieces.  Katniss was a great symbol for the first two books and just pathetic in the last.  The “Girl on Fire” fizzled out .
