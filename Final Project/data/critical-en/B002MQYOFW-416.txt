I really enjoyed the other two books in The Hunger Games trilogy and thus was extremely disappointed with this one.  Katniss was not the hero she had become in the other books.  In this book she was selfish, whiney and redundant.  I read more than half the book still waiting for her redeeming qualities to emerge, but they didn't.  I waited the whole book for a better story line between her, Peeta and Gale but that never happened.  Overall, very, very disappointing.
