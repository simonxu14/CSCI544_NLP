I really enjoyed the first two books in this trilogy, with Catching Fire being my favorite, but really didn't care for Mockingjay at all. I realized halfway through it that I don't like a single character -- I hate them all. Even Peeta who was always the most noble was ruined. Katniss never showed much growth as a character and she was robbed of her goal at the end.<br /><br />Could Katniss be drugged anymore? Could she have any more dreams/hallucinations? Can they open up any more cans of food and eat them? Ugh. I also thought all the 'pods' in the Capitol were ridiculous. We can only hope the movie version is more realistic, more uplifting and triumphant in the end. Or else it will be a box office disaster after the opening weekend.<br /><br />Yes, yes, war changes people. Especially children. I guess that's what it's all about. But it made for a terrible book.
