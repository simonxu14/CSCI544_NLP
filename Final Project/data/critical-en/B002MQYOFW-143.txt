The whole series is lack of logic and it's particularly bad for the last book. The descriptions of the war torn districts and their population are extremely shallow and poorly executed. I don't know what Collins is trying to achieve here. It would have been better if she sticks to the teen love story theme so the book won't read as pretentious as it is now.<br />And what's with Katniss? If the first two books were aimed at making her unlikable then the last book renders her completely unbearable. The character becomes so calculating and selfish that there's not one moment she had tried to put anyone else need above her own agenda, writing people off at her own convenience.
