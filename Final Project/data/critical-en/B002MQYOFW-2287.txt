I read this book while travelling on a short work trip and finished the book in a couple of days due to some hefty delays.  While it was entertaining enough it really wasn't anything special. At the end of the book it leads heavily into the next book of the series and frankly I didn't feel it was worth it to continue on to Catching fire. For me the biggest problem I have with the book is that the action wasn't the main focus but was the most interesting part, the character development and love story were weakly written. I didn't feel I cared about any of the characters. Also, the back story of Panem was very lacking in detail and I would have liked the book to explore this more and paint a better picture of the world the story was set in. With all that said I am still glad I read the book if only to understand what others have been talking about and get the pop culture references. I can ultimately say it is a good read but it isn't any better than dozens of other books dealing with a similar story lines that are practically unknown in comparison. I suppose what I don't understand is what made this book so popular?
