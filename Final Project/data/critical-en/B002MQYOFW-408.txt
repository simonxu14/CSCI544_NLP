Gave 5 stars to the first two books. Much deserved. This book is descent. Worth the read, but crested a little over the top politically, lacked the relationship aspects the first two books afforded, and wasn't active or immersing. It had it's redeeming moments, ones that gained the three stars, ones I won't spoil.<br /><br />Here's what I would have loved to have seen: Prim be chosen for the games, Peeta and Katniss mentor her and in the midst of this, take down the Capitol. Just my opinion.<br /><br />Love the series.
