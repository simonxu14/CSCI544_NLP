At the beginning of the book it was pretty boring. Until the middle of the book is where it got interesting. I wanted to see Katniss more with Petta and unfortunately didn't see it. I was upset at the ending just because it ended a little too weird and after all the bad that happened I felt like they couldn't recover any happiness in the book. I recommend this book if you want to finish the trilogy but I am still sadden.
