I don't usually review books, but this time I actually feel obligated to warn my fellow THG fans. This book was not terrible the entire way through, as it did hold some of the attributes that I enjoyed from the first two books. In all honesty, I enjoyed the books in descending order simply because I felt the author had pure gold the first time around, then suffered the inability to recreate the magic as time went on. The last book was awful not because of the twists in the storyline, because I saw them coming, but because it felt like the author gave up. The ending is so rushed, I felt empty in the end. Almost like the author said, "Mmm, I don't think I want to write anymore." and chose the crappiest, most rushed ending the editor would swallow.<br /><br />You've been warned.
