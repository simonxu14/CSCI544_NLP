I actually read the whole series.  I loved the plot line; however, I wish that more was included.  I realize that it was present and first person view. Spoiler Alert...Skip to next paragraph. One of the things that really bothered me was the fact that it was never told exactly how Peeta helped Katniss while they were separated during the Hunger Games (Did he tell them she had a obscure talent? Did he lead them away from where he thought she'd be? Did he see her traps or even her and go a different way?).  I know Katniss did not know at the time; but she was forced to watch a review of the competition and the writer just flew right over that.<br /><br />  I also watched the movie and my only true issue with the movie was the scene where Katniss climbed the tree.  I felt that it made her a more cowardly character to run away rather then invite her enemy to come join her.  I liked the spunk in her invite; I felt that scene was had more spunk in the book then in the movie, which was truer to the Katniss that was built in the book.<br /><br />  Over all the series had an excellent plot line.  Very easy read. I feel like elementary children could read with ease, though I do not recommend in for such young children because of the content.
