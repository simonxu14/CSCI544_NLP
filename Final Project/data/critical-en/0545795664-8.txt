BOOK BINDING QUALITY: 0 stars<br />BOOK INFORMATION QUALITY: 5 stars<br /><br />We bought &quot;Pok&eacute;mon Deluxe Essential Handbook: The Need-to-Know Stats and Facts on Over 700 Pok&eacute;mon&quot; in Paperback from Amazon on August 25, 2016. Within a month, a few pages had fallen out and we chalked it up to chance. Now, two months in, there are probably 30 pages that have come out, including single pages and bigger sections. This is ridiculous for a kids book that you know will be read and reread and shared around with friends and flipped through time and time again. This book definitely should have a spiral binding. My son is very disappointed that he spent his birthday money on something that hasn't lasted.<br /><br />That said, he loves this book and looks at it daily and it's so full of information that it keeps him busy reading for hours.
