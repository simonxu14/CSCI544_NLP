Good read until the last couple chapters.  Then it's just a deux ex  machina, and it was nothing less than terrible and disappointing. She concluded nothing and just dropped off on other things she had focused on through the novel. Sad that it had to be the last in the trilogy that was so bad. Not recommended.
