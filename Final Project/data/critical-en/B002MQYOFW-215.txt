This isn't a book that will make you laugh and smile or warm your heart. It's definitely dark and depressing. It will move you though. There is a lot of gore, and the author hasn't held back on the honesty of the brutality of war. I realize that eventually this book will be made into a movie for teens, and I'm trying to work out in my head how they will keep the PG-13 rating without altering the story drastically.<br /><br />I can't give it four stars as I did with the other two, because the story is simply depressing. At least in the first two novels, there were moments that made me smile. This one is definitely lacking that. I'm glad that I did read it, but even though I purchased this book, I can't say I will ever read it again. I was really depressed after I finished it.<br /><br />There's a definite lack of Peeta here. I don't wanna give away any spoilers why, but this particular installment focuses much more on Katniss' relationship with Gale. I'm very sad to add that a very key character does get killed off, and after this happened towards the end of the book, I had to ask myself what the point of all of Katniss' suffering was. Honestly, if that particular person had not died, I probably would've given it four stars.<br /><br />I have to admit that the Epilogue was satisfying. There is--in a way--a happy ending here. More bittersweet, I'd say. I don't understand why so many people were so unhappy with the Epilogue. I think it's safe to say that any human being would not get over being put through so much devastation to have their life go completely back to normal. And despite what one reviewer said, good definitely triumphs over evil in this book.<br /><br />This book was honest and haunting. I still think about it and the meaning a lot.
