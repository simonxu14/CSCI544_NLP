My teenage daughter loved the first two books and was counting the days until the third book would be released.  However, it was a huge disappointment to her.  Without divulging the ending to those who haven't read the third, there were twists and turns and events that happened to characters that seemed unnecessary at best.  If you haven't read Mockingjay, our advice is don't you will be happier making up your own ending ;-)
