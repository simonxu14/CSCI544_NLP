If anyone remembers the J J Abrams produced and directed series ALIAS with Jennifer Garner I believe you'll identify a similar downward trajectory with this Collins series. Starts off with brilliantly developed and sympatheic characters and descends into ridiculous nonsense. Two strong female protaganists in each, wonderful empowering story lines and at the end-WTF? Book One of this trilogy was amazing. Someone suggested I read this "young adult" fiction and when I finally got around to it, I was so impressed and engaged with the lovely writing and character development. As with ALIAS' final season, when Abrams was off developing his series LOST, I feel that Collins was absolutely not present for MOCKINGJAY. The tedious action sequences, completely implausible plot lines, the total absence of heart. I don't mind sad endings, or middles at all. Just don't turn your back on all of your hard work heretofore Ms. Collins. This was phoned in to an incompetent editor. Enjoy the undeserved profits, but I will not purchase another title by you. THE HUNGER GAMES was as fantastic as MOCKINGJAY is awful. What a tragedy for your readers. Shame.
