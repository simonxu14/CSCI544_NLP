Sorry. I just WANT to like Mockingjay so bad. I can't keep putting off my decision on whether to like it or not.<br /><br />Ok. The author MADE us hate Gale... because she wanted Katniss and Peeta to end up together. I didn't choose to hate him, and truly, I don't. It makes me dislike the author as much as I dislike Katniss without Gale.<br /><br />I understand Katniss and Peeta together; they went through the games so they can understand each other, he redeems her, all that sort of stuff. I LIKE Peeta. But being forced to hate Gale doesn't let me love him, or be glad that he ended up with the girl.<br /><br />At first, I didn't know what to think about Katniss. I am not a "dwell on it" kind of person, which we know from her situation with her mom after her dad's death, she is exactly that. I should have known, but to let her "soulmate" become hated because of something out of his control... that just seems a bit much.<br /><br />I read a review (amazon, maybe?) about her behavior, hiding in closets, escaping through blackouts, ect... and the reviewer, a trained psychologist, says that the author really did her homework when it came to post-traumatic stress syndrome. That Katniss basically was a poster child for what people go through. That explained a lot about her behavior and her constant blacking out, but didn't necessarily endear me to her character. I want a strong, always on their game heroine. Not one who can't get a grip. I want someone who comes out stronger, a better person, not simply a survivor. A sucky survivor at that.<br /><br />And, since post-traumatic stuff is mostly associated with war, it made me think that someone (the author? publisher? editor?) had an agenda and there is nothing more that I hate than a book that goes all agenda on me when all want is to be entertained. If I want to read about how war is terrible and we should stop all of the conflict, I'll pick up a newspaper.<br /><br />The being passed out for most of the action was a very plausible idea, but it just seemed like lazy writing to me.<br /><br />The book is obviously science fiction. The author should have left it at that and not tried to go so deep with Mockingjay. Develop the character, yes. Give us something to think about, yes please. Indoctrinate, force us to hate a character and rush the end.... unforgivable. Sorry.<br /><br />I tried. Just can't like it.
