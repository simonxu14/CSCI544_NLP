I ordered this product on November 15 and it took Amazon 15 days to get it too me. I called them twice and all they could do was blame the shipper. Apparently Amazon doesn't know how to take responsibility for poor customer service. It would have been easier just to send this by the US Postal service. I might have gotten it before Thanksgiving Day which is what I was hoping for. If you have a choice buy locally and save yourself the headaches.
