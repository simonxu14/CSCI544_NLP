After constantly trying to escape the grips of the Capitol, Katniss finds herself slowly falling apart. With everything around her spinning out of control- she knows the only thing she can do is rebel. Katniss is the Mockingjay.<br /><br />This book had a few things that were hard to grasp. In the previous books, Suzanne Collins did a terrific job pacing everything- when in this book I found some parts extremely slow and then some I had a hard time understanding what was going on. This book seemed to be the most emotional, only because of how some things ended. It was an interesting read, but all I got out of it was dread.
