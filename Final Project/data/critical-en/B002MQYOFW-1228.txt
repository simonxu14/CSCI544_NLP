Just my opinion......... I feel it hovers around a 3.5 review.<br /><br />Warning may have some SPOILER tidbits....<br /><br />PArt of the problem may be how much I anticipated this book.  I hate having such high expectations for a book sometimes.<br /><br />There was something that felt more superficial about this book comapared to the other 2.  Not all through the book mind you, but enough to be a bit disappointing, after the greatness of the first 2.<br /><br />I just read a review by  Ilana here on Amazon and think she nailed a lot of things that I could not quite put my finger on that felt "off".<br />Boiling down to the lack of growth, maturity, or leadership you would normally expect in a lead heroine type charater in the final book.<br />In fact there seemes to be so much wasted time in this book her waiting around for other people to decide what to do..<br />The few times she did take charge the book shined, but they were too infrequent IMO.<br />There was still a compelling story woven in this text with great characters old and new, but it did lack a certain spark and energy that drove the first 2 books.<br />I also think that all the main characters suffered some sort of detachment and were not as enduring, likeable or connectable.<br />We all knew where this book was going it was more a matter of how we were getting there.<br />I think Peeta's story was a great twist, but did not like how Gale's character and interactions were written.<br />Gale was not the same to me, he became more one demensional and cliched :(..<br />The constantly filming everything for a "show" and footage got old and was overused, especially at the end.<br />I think the ending of this book was too anti-climatic and felt a bit flat.<br />SO much so that it did not, IMO, Validate killing off so many Likeble characters.<br />I honestly spent pages hoping that there was a some sort of head injury hallucination going on and this really wasn't how it was ending...After feeling like I was JUST getting into the climax.<br />I can not say I hate it the ending, I can see it having an appeal enjoy.  It just felt SOOOO  flat to me.<br />I am also left feeling that this great heroine that was built up for 2 great stunning books ended up a broken soul much like Haymitch, and I do not like that :(.<br />I feel she settled and was tamed, and that was not who we met in book one.
