I really like the main characters, and the baseline for the story,but this story just dragged on and on.  It got very boring and confusing near the end.  Also, it seemed like the author was as sick of writing the book as I was sick of reading it.  It ended so abruptly....the worst part is that I really got no satisfaction with the end of the book.  I think this could be turned into a great movie by chopping 70% of the book off, sort of like the first movie did.  This is the first series where I like the movie much more than the book.
