After reading the first 2 books in the series, I couldn't wait to start the final one. However, it was a total bust! I was beyond disappointed! I continue to ask myself how she could possibly do this to her characters and not to mention her readers... I just hope Hollywood will do a complete "re-do"! Maybe end it in a somewhat happy manner, rather than as a depressing eyesore...
