This is a well written, well constructed conclusion to the Hunger Games Trilogy.  "Mockingjay" ultimately takes us where we thought we would go, with the good guys winning and the bad guys losing.  I don't think this is a surprise or a spoiler to anyone.  It's a matter of how they get there that is a problem.<br /><br />SOME SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!<br /><br />One of the major plot themes of the first two books is katniss' path to maturity, self awareness, etc.  That is a huge part of great science fiction.  "Ender's Game" has been referenced in at least one review, but in fact in that book Ender ultimately goes off as an ambassador using the recollections of a defeated society to create a new method of coming toterms to with a life lived for his society.  There is proof of individual growth, and with a societal benefit.<br /><br />That demonstrated growh is why "Ender's Game" is considered great science fiction and an interesting discussion about the education and growth of gifted children, and why "Mockingjay" is ultimately not all it could be.<br /><br />Katniss does not such thing, and I think that was critical for this book to continue what was done in the first two books.  You know the Capitol will fall, so it needs something else to make the book breathe.  Instead of growth, of taking control of herself, Katniss is buffeted about by the decisions of others.  Some are logically encountered, others not so much.  Nowhere does the author really create the truly shocking moments that pepper the first two books.  When Katniss makes decisions, or comes to major changes in thinking-like who she really wants to kill-there is nothing to substantiate it.  We never see her at her trial, we never hear her justify her decisions to the populace that adores her.  A character offers a condition of how she will ultimately choose between Gale and Peeta-but instead the decision is made for her by others.<br /><br />For this to be truly huge finale we needed-and frankly, deserved-a conclusion with a more fully formed Katniss, and to hear her explain and/or defend her decisions-be it in court, conversation, or in a letter.<br /><br />With that, the book would have been a big time 5+ star book.  Instead, it is a three start beach book that could have been so much more.
