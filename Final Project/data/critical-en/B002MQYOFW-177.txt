Search the word "DISAPPOINTED" through all the reviews.  Even a lot of positive reviews start out with, "I was dissatisfied with the ending at first but, later I decided I was wrong..."  I'm sorry, but in this case, if it feels like the ending sucks, it sucks.<br /><br />But the first two books were good right?  YES.  So, from there you're probably left thinking, "Now we have a team of the most proven, charismatic, skilled assassins escape, join a rebellion, and get ready to use their leadership and warfare skills to bring an end to hundreds of years of horrible oppression!  Within that is a tense love triangle and characters evolving in important ways.  Just imagine how great this could have been!  How could you go wrong with such a promising premise?!  But it does go wrong.  If you liked the first books, this probably *isn't the ending you're searching for*.  It shows Collins is skilled when dealing with a smaller story with a more focussed group of characters, but something as large in scope as a whole WAR is outside her comfort zone.<br /><br />In the end, the story arc of Katnis Everdeen is not satisfying.  Mockingjay spends time in the wrong places, has characters' story arcs end abruptly without payoff or meaning, and it is even logically flawed.  Even when trying to make an anti-war point, it trips over its own feet.  Instead it just paints a picture of a situation where war is necessary to bring peace, and rather than admit that fact, it tries to rearrange the events of the ending to show "See, both sides shouldn't be fighting!"  What?  I wish this book could get an "undo", and we could get a do-over.<br /><br />Is this book Real or not Real?  I wish, not real.  Sad.  Hopefully whoever makes the Mockingjay MOVIE will say, "Thanks for the first two books, we'll take it from here."
