I chose this rating not because I don't like the story, but because they overcharged for a library bound book. I got this book to complete the hardcover set I had started purchasing back when the books first came out.  I wanted the original cover drawing.  I was shocked to discover that this is not a hardcover book with a slip cover, that I paid nearly $20 for.  Just go to Barnes and Noble and at least you can be rest assured that you are going to get what you think you are purchasing.  To explain, this book is much smaller with inferior paper and a thin card board cover that is glossy.  No slip cover.  Library bound. Boo Amazon.
