I was seriously disappointed after reading.  I went through all 3 books in less than a week and I have to say that Mockingjay was my lease favorite.  Unlike, Catching Fire, this book seemed like it was dragging.  It wasn't until the last 4 chapters that I really felt intrigued.  The ending is very realistic - but that's just it...  it's too realistic!  I was hoping for a sappy, dreamy, ending where everyone is happy and safe.  Why, oh, why, did Prim die?  The premise of the book (I thought) was to save Prim but she's dead.<br />I do get why she picked Peeta though.  I understand that Gale and her was growing apart.  It was very apparent in the book.  However, I wished Suzanne Collins told us more about Gale.  It's as if he just simply disappeared from view!<br />All in all, the Trilogy in itself is awesome.  But this last book left a lot of questions unanswered - at least for me.
