If you want to read a book about kids killing other kids, then this book is for you.  If you would like read about an otherwise sympathetic main character breaking the bloated fingers of a girl she has killed to pry a bow and arrow from her hands, and then to rejoice at her good fortune in obtaining the lethal weapon, then this book is for you.  In this story, 24 innocent children are plucked from their district and pitted against each other in a life and death struggle.  These hitherto innocent and peace loving children have been chosen by a starvation induced lottery system to become killers, and they do.  All the kids become killers with little to no self-reflection, even the main characters who are supposed to be 'good'.  There are profound situation ethics problems that are proposed by this story that are unsatisfactorily answered.  If you read this book, read it with your eyes open to the unethical actions of all the adults and children involved created by this author.
