BUYER BEWARE! My kids absolutely love this book BUT it started loosing pages only days after purchasing it. At first I tried glueing and taping individual pages but now so many pages have fallen out I can't keep up.  My kids take really good care of this book but for as many pages as it has (this is a thick book) it needs a much better binding.
