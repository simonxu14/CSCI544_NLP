For Katniss to have been the symbol of so much, the third book was a BIG disappointment. She was the biggest pawn ever in the biggest game ever. Then the author turned her into an boring ordinary person instead of letting her continue to lead with Peeta. Ugh!!!! The third book was such a waste of time to write and to read.
