NO SPOILERS, SAFE to read.<br /><br />I enjoyed this final installment; it's easy to follow and contained, for me, a satisfying resolution.<br /><br />I'll get this out of the way at the start...the one aspect that took me out of the story somewhat frequently and seemed a bit less than realistic was the constant self-attribution for everything that goes wrong, that Katniss does to herself. It got to the point that I suspected she'd blame herself if it was a cloudy day.<br /><br />I noticed only a few glitches in the formatting of the kindle version.<br /><br />I don't really relate to the reviews I read about the ending being somehow less than fulfilling...I found it both satisfying and believable. As a statement on the overall quality of the 3 book series I'll say that it's unlikely most readers would consider these reviews before making their decision to buy Mockingjay, it's just too good a series not to. Once you read The Hunger Games, you MUST read all three. Well done!
