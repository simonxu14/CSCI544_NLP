What a disappointment<br />I have finished the Hunger Games trilogy and come away wondering if the third book was ghost written or pushed through with no editing advice.<br />After developing plot and characters for two books it is as if the author lost steam and got tired of her creations, therefore, since its war, she just killed them all off.  It was like literary extinction; the author has taken this character as far as it can go....poof, you're dead.  Here is what I didn't like:<br />Too many character's built and woven into Katniss' life are so easily expendable<br />Plutarch remains such an ambiguous character, likeable, greedy, unlikeable, scheming, self serving and yet he is the one who remains<br />Too many plot devices stumble to nothingness.<br />The pearl<br />Friendship with Joanna<br />Effie (abducted/tortured/back and counting time/gone)<br />Coin?????????<br />The whole lost my mind thing........seriously?  how about "I don't know how much time has passed but this is what happened in my insanity"..................and explain more<br />Build up the friendship/mentorship with Finnick to chop it all off?  He deserved better since the reader invested in him and Annie<br />Gale's family another expendable plot device<br />As I reflect, the only character true to themselves and therefore one I can invest is Haymich.  He was and remains just a drunk.  He comes out of his alcohol cloud for a few brief moments of clarity and brilliance, but he returns to stupor again and again<br />I began to wonder if I hadn't paid attention.  The beauty of a kindle is you can search for specific words.  So Mockinjay ends with this beautiful statement about dandelions.  I used the kindle to search and there is no mention of dandelions in catching fire and 4 mentions of them in Hunger Games.  A plot device should flow through the story so the reader can further connect to the characters and events, not just random hodge podge thoughts.<br />There is also this allusion to her father but I don't feel it is ever flushed out completely as a believeable thought, its more of an afterthought, oh yeah, I miss my father, oh yeah, this connects me to my father.<br />I guess the message of the whole trilogy is if I become a scrapbooker all my problems will be over.  Hope Katniss waits for the sale at Hobby Lobby, card stock can get expensive.
