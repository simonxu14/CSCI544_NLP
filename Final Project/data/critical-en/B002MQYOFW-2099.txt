(Spoiler Alert)  After struggling to put down The Hunger Games and finding Catching Fire to be almost as good as the first.....I struggled to even finish Mockingjay.  Too many moments where Katniss dissolves within herself...Not enough explanation of the Capitol's demise or the plots of District 13 or its official role in the rebellion and its leaders true intentions.....And most dissatisfying of all the disintegration of all of the relationships Katniss held dear that made her who she was and the first book so enjoyable.  Not sure what the author was trying to get at in this last book, but I am sorry to say that I took the time to read them just to end up so deflated and with so many unanswered questions......
