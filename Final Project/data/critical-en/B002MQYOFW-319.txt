I have been reading books like 'The Hunger Games' for a while. I read Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, and I almost read Twilight. I thought that the endings were the strongest part, especially in Harry Potter, which THG are most compared to. This book gets VERY boring and talks about things that never are explained but has one thing that makes it so you can't stop reading: Peeta. He gets in a weird situation with Snow (not saying what... don't wanna spoil) and it kind of is the whole storyline. It ends too quickly. Gale is COMPLETELY out of her life in the Epilogue, which I think is stupid. It is a good series, but the book has a terrible ending, a bad storyline, and just SUCKS. It does not live up to Catching Fire, what is one of the best books ever in my opinion,
