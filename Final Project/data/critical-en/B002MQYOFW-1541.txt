The third book in the series falls flat on its face compared to the first two. The characters that developed in the first books, were unrecognizable. If I wouldn't have know that this was the third book in the Hunger Games Trilogy, and the names of the characters weren't the same, I would have said this was an entirely different story. It's  as if the author knew she wrote two great books and decided she couldn't could do any better and just gave up. It was boring, uneventful, and very anticlimactic. What a disappointment, such a great sorry to end so dull. I very hard pressed to even give it one star. I really can't say one good thing about this book. Suzanne Collins please rewrite the Mockingjay.
