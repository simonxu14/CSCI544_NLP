I am truly disappointed with this conclusion. The ending gives you enclosure, no feeling of good conquering bad. There was no glory in Katniss's finally. I almost feel bad for those about to read this. I wanted this to be a good ending. Instead it was. just depressing. The theme song for this book should be "suicidal". I recommend stopping with the first book.
