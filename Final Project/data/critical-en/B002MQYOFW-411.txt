This is a terrific read if your a teenaged virgin girl.  It's an okay venture for everyone else.  Everything is pretty superficial and direct.  There are some twists and turns I guess but not particularly challenging.  To me this novel is a byproduct of a jaded society dominated by quick hit television and movies.  The is author is talented and does address what she intended to...coming of age for teenage girls and dealing with violence.  A catchy little pop tome.
