but I thought this book (and the whole series) was just Ok. From the Fantasy perspective, there are many books with better adventure, plot, and characterization (anything by Tolkien, Donaldson, or Feist, for example). I think one of the biggest reasons for the popularity of the series is that these books are the first experience many people have had with the fantasy genre. Welcome aboard, but don't stop here!<br />My biggest complaint about the series is that they are passed off as children's books (I don't know if Rowling shares this view). Here is the message they present so you can decide if it's appropriate for your children:<br />1. Children should never share their problems with an adult - keep them secret - especially if the problem entails another adult. 2. Sneaking off in the middle of the night to forbidden areas is a good idea and always works out in the end. 3. Adult supervision is unnecessary.  4. It is ok to disobey. 5. Children know better than adults.  6. Adults can't be trusted.<br />I don't know about you, but I want my children to trust me and come to me with their problems. They will also be in considerable danger if they disobey some of our rules.<br />My final beef with these books is that they are all the same (which is why this has turned into a series review instead of a single book review). i.e. Kid is threatened by evil adult. Kid doesn't ask for help. Kid disobeys. Kid does stupid things. Kid puts himself in more danger. Kid triumphs and everything works out great in the end.<br />Bottom line - they're a quick read without much depth and have possible negative connotations if read by young children. Enjoy them for what they are, but don't be mislead by the hype - there's nothing new here and there are much better fantasy books that have been sitting in your library for over 60 years.
