I have been a loyal adult HP reader for years and preordered my book to arrive at my destination while on vacation.  I devoured the book in short order and found that the more time I had to think about the book, the more disappointed I was in it.<br /><br />TOO MUCH<br />The needless addition of the Hallows to the problem of the Horcruxes seemed to me to be overkill.  There also seemed to be too many random events to 'tie up' loose ends that felt quite out of place and forced.  There are so many different locations that the novel takes place in, you never get a true sense of being in a magical world, you're just moving around as fast as possible willy nilly.  Even the scenes in Hogwarts, which has always yielded new wonders in each previous book, seems staid and dull.  Finally, the epilogue was a bit juvenile.  I could have done without it completely.<br /><br />NOT ENOUGH<br />While I will freely admit to being glad to see old characters pop up again, most of them had either no value to the story, such as the Durselys and Dolores Umbridge or were treated in such an offhanded manner as to thoroughly disappoint me, such as the treatment of characters like Mad Eye Moody, Ginny, Hedwig, Hagrid, etc.  I understand her need to tie up loose ends, but I'd rather had a few loose ends and seen the main story line be a little better fleshed out, especially Voldemort's characterization.  In the end, I came away thinking much less of Voldemort's power.  He was written as a ruthless character with the brains to rival Crabbe and Goyle.<br /><br />MISSED OPPORTUNITIES<br />The ending of the book could have been better.  As it stands, I felt it suffered from being contrived.  Why overly complicate an ending in a book who's intended audience, at least in theory, is young readers?  I don't think that the Hallows added anything to the book, as the Horcruxes were enough to drive the plot and we already expected it from book 6 anyway.  Had the Hallows been omitted, she could have easily spent more time on character development and better explanations on how they got out of sticky situations.<br /><br />There were several things I enjoyed about book, and I cried several times, but overall I was not as inspired as I've been in previous installments.  I don't envy Rowling's laundry list of 'must do's' that she was expected to complete, but I think she could have prioritized better and maybe left a few things out to make a more cohesive story.  I'm sad that this is the last adventure that we'll have with Harry and the gang, but if this is the way it was heading then maybe it is a good time to say goodbye.
