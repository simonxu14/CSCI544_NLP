The first and the second books show many bright qualities of the main characters such as Katniss and Peeta's determination to keep each other safe, Peeta's caring so much for Katniss, etc. On the other hand, the book is so depressing. It may seem to be exciting for some readers, but the beauty of love and imaginations are gone completely in this book. I felt broken and shattered. I was so gloomy all the way to the end. I did not expect this because the previous books show some hints of hope for something good (or may be I personally hope for it).<br /><br />And it's very disappointing that many characters that made reader fall in love with, such as Prim and Finnik, dies like a blow. The dying moment was so short and so unimportant.<br /><br />I find this book very hard to comprehend. Many times I made a wrong imagination of what happen to who.
