The 3 rd of the Trilogy lacked the excitement and passion that I found in the first two. I found it hard to imagine or resonate with many of the details the author was trying to describe as the story unwound. The pace was slower and lacked the wow factor the first 2 books did. It is still a good read, but fails to deliver on par with the first 2.
