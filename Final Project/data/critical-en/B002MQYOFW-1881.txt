I wasn't planning on reading this book because I was concerned it would be another young adult book that focused on a love story, like a certain series about vampires, which I haven't read, nor ever will. However, my wife wants to see the movies and to be fair I figured I should read the books before seeing the movies. I knew enough before reading the book that it was about a love triangle and was worried that the book would focus on a love story, which I don't find interesting if it's the focal point of the book. My wife insisted the love story wasn't the focus of the book so I decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />When I was halfway through the book, I thought it was great and actually shed some tears in regards to Katniss and Rue, which I won't give away, but that scene was just heart wrenching. If the 2nd half of the book had continued in the same manner as the first I would have given it 5 stars, but sadly it didn't. Shortly after that Katniss and Rue scene, when the Capital decided to change the rules, the story started to unravel, specifically because it bean to focus on the love story. First off, when you establish rules, you don't change them, it leads to the reader losing vested interest since rules can change. And that's what happened to me, but it was even worse when the rules changed AGAIN at the end of battle.<br /><br />The love story that began to develop in the second half of the story just felt so contrived. Somewhat believable from the viewpoint of Peeta, but not so from Katniss. The kissing and petting scenes just seemed so forced and there seemed absolutely no connection from Katniss, even though she seemed to waffle back and forth at times questioning her feelings for Peeta. Katniss overall just seemed devoid of emotion. Other than her father, Prim and Rue (who reminded Katniss of her sister) she doesn't seem to have any emotions for anyone, not even Gale.<br /><br />I was so disappointed at the turn of this book, that at 80% of the way through the Kindle edition I thought that with 20% remaining it had a chance to redeem itself but unfortunately it never did.<br /><br />So overall, it was a great first half of the book but it was unable to carry that intensity to the end. I really enjoyed Haymitch throughout and really look forward to seeing Woody Harrelson portray him in the movie. Absolute perfect casting!
