This book may have been targeting teenagers? But I couldn't put the book down and enjoyed the character telling the story.  The premise was interesting and of course if you want to draw analogies to the present day, the parallels between the first world (Capitol) and the third world (Districts) are clear.  It is sort of a toned down Margaret Atwood story. All that aside, just a good action read, recommend for the beach and can't wait to see the movie...
