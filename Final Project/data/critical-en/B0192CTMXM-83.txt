I started out deliberately ignoring the Harry Potter phenomenon, until I went to see the first movie with my wife and her (then) 6 year old daughter. We absolutely loved it, and after that we devoured the first 4 books, taking turns reading to each other. We loved the imagination, the humor and everything else. And naturally we pre-ordered this one from Amazon.<br />But we both felt frustrated with this 5th installment. There was some of the humor, the plot wasn't bad and it was generally ok. But we really did not like this emotional, whiny, angry brat that used to be Harry Potter. Now I understand he's supposed to be a teenager, but really, this is way over the top. And all the elements that made the other books such "magical" experiences, just were not on the same level.<br />Some reviewers suggested rereading the book several times to appreciate it. Now I have to ask, how empty is your life if you have time to read a 800+ page book more than once?<br />My two cents.
