I guess it's hard to follow a book like the first one in this trilogy (The Hunger Games) but I thought Ms. Collins might be able to pull it off.  Boy was I disappointed.  Felt like there were senseless elements to the story and the ending left me wanting.  The book just ended with no real satisfaction for the reader. I get that the author was trying to educate youth about war and it's affects as well as the direction our society is taking (and how close we really are to this kind of existence), but there still could've been a better ending.  Maybe what I was looking for was more hope.  The first two books really give you that sense of hope and accomplishment while the last book is just dark, depressing and well, realistic.  Was really hoping for more not just for me, but for the young people also reading it.
