I just finished the last book and was totally disappointed. I felt as though the author lost her momentum.<br />In the first two books I was captivated by her writing, in this one, I felt like someone else had taken over and I was reading a different story by a different author.<br />I wanted more of the same but this one just took too many turns and I didn't feel as deep of a connection with any of the characters. I wanted more about Gale and Peeta and their relationship with Katniss. I thought I might get to know Gale more in this one, but he was all over the place and I felt as though his character was never developed in full.<br />The ending seemed so sudden and totally took a nose dive.<br />Instead of hanging onto every word, I wanted it to be over and felt bored at times.<br />Sad because the first two books were fabulous!
