A major disappointment.  The ending seems rushed and cobbled together.  WARNING: Possible Spoiler Ahead.  The climactic scene becomes a mere afterthought when the results of that scene had significant ramifications for all of Panem and the protagonist, Katniss.  Yet the author explains everything away in just a few paragraphs. The description of Katniss' life after the climax is summarized and incongruent, as if the author had a deadline to meet, or had only so many pages with which to fit it all in.<br /><br />But the ending wasn't the only problem I had with this book.  Katniss spends way too much time throughout the novel a)kicking and screaming while being hauled off to be sedated, b) under the influence of "morphling," which the author conveniently uses as a device to ignore whole parts of the story, and c) contemplating her love triangle (by the end I was hoping both beaus would be killed off just to stop it.  Instead, the author, again, summarizes the fate of both Peeta, and especially Gale, with few words).<br /><br />I had high hopes, but Mockingjay left me feeling like a good story had been stolen from me.
