After the first three books, which, although the plots were pretty much the same for each book, at least introduced some new and interesting characters and plot twists, this book seems like the publisher either asked Ms. Rowling to deliver a bigger book, or, filled with the self-inflated notion that she is a great writer, she decided to add a lot more in the way of description. But, Ms. Rowling is no Herman Melville or Victor Hugo. Unlike the first three books, there is no hook at the beginning of this book. Instead, it contains long, arduous sections of unnecessary description without anything happening. Perhaps uncritical fans of Harry Potter relish every morsel and for them 700 pages is not enough, but the rest of us have lives and other things to do. I was told that the fourth book was better than the first three, but I suppose art is in the eyes of the beholder.
