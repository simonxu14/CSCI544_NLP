The premise is a game where 24 children between the ages of 11 and 18 are locked in an arena to kill each other until only 1 remains.  It sinks into greater depravity and misery from there.  Who recommended this series for children? It should be rated X for harsh content and kept from anyone under college age.  It's about inhumanity, both on an individual level, and what such action and treatment does to perpetrators and survivors.  It's about what kind of political system would employ such measures.  The descriptions of barbaric violence are graphic and specific.  I have images in my mind it will take me a long time to be rid of.  I wish I'd never read it.
