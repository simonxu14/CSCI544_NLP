Disclaimer: this review has NOTHING to do with the content of the literary work!  Only the condition of the product itself, and the packaging it came in.<br /><br />I bought these books on recommendation from a friend, and while the books themselves seem readable, there are bent corners (of the dust cover AND the hardcover books), which should never have happened since the books come in a BOX set.  And speaking of the box, it's piece-of-crap corrugated cardboard.  So while it's thick, don't expect to feel proud to have it sitting on your bookshelf, because it's ugly and unseemly.  Expect to recycle it immediately when you get the books.<br /><br />The packaging job was abysmal, as well.  My books shipped from Amazon, and I've never been so utterly frustrated and disappointed with their packaging standards as I was when I opened this package.  To make a long story short, the box the product shipped in was twice the size of the product - literally - and there was no packaging material beyond the slashed-open carcasses of two fist-sized, plastic bag air pockets.<br /><br />So while I offer no opinion on the content of the books themselves (as I JUST got them and have yet to read them), I definitely DO recommend considering purchasing them elsewhere.  Like - maybe a local bookstore.  Which is exactly what I will do from here on out with EVERY book I intend to buy.
