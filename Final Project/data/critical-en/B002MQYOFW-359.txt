I've always said that in a trilogy there is at least one of the books that doesn't compare to the others. Sometimes it's the second, sometimes the third one. Pullman's His Dark Material is the exception. And the Hunger Games are no exception: I found the third installment quite disappointing: the story (a war) has lost the innovative ideas and plot that the other books offered. The characters are more one-dimensional, and the love triangle between Katniss, Gale and Peeta is totally unconvincing. Such a shame.
