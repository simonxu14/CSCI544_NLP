Another whine fest from a sadly unlikable hero set in the absurdly unworkable world of the districts. There are so many incongruities and glaring issues with the world setting that it makes it hard to focus on the story line. Suzanne Collins is an excellent writer but the story line is so bad it makes the entire series fall short.
