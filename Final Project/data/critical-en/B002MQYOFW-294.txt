So...I liked the Hunger Games, I liked the characters, the story moves really quick & is engaging, well-written.  Katniss is a great lead--smart, kind, and generally likeable.  You're really rooting for her.  But at the end, I wasn't interested in reading the other 2 books.  It dissolved for me from an adventure/fantasy story into a teen romance, and I could completely predict where the other books were going to head, so there wasn't a need to read them.  I know plenty of people who gobbled up all 3 & loved them, but I was ready to move on after Hunger Games.
