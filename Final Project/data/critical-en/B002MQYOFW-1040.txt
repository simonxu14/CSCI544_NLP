The Hunger Games is simple and engaging, a quick and easy read for young and old.  The writer pulls the reader along gently, but with enough force that he or she must discover the outcome.  A very young reader will enjoy a great story without suffering from real, bloody violence, but with a slight scent of death and competition.  Also, the power that government can have should awaken them to the value of voting after studying candidates beyond media hype into real ideologies.
