I'm an older reader, and chose to read The Hunger Games trilogy because I work with adolescents and wanted to see what they are reading.  I actually enjoyed the first book immensely,.  The characters were well constructed, and the relationships explored in some depth.  I was keen to read the second one, mostly because I wanted to follow up on what happened to the main characters and was a little disturbed with the repetition of the same themes.  This third book I found to be simply dark and destructive; it was hard to find a redeeming message or a character to root for.  It's almost as though it was written as a potential movie script or violent video game, with true emotion left behind.  I needed to find something to uplife my spirit once I was done!
