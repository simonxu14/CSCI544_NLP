It was really hard to get into this one. I think after 3 books one is already invested in the characters and want to know what's happening in their world. It wasn't highly enjoyable until the middle.<br /><br />The Hagrid parts in this book ruined that character for me and left me wondering why they would still be friends with him after everything.<br /><br />I liked the introduction of other students to this Scooby gang. Ginny, Luna, and Neville.<br /><br />The interactions with Professor Mc and Umbridge were great.
