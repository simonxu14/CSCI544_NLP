I thought the first two books were Awesome! The third book seemed to drag on forever and had too much killing. Over kill...LITERALLY! Main point...I was really disappointed. It did not live up to what I was expecting and I felt that the ending was weak! You have to read it though! You have to get the closure to the "love triangle" with Peeta, Katniss and Gale! I am not a writer but I felt the ending story could have been better!
