My school assigned this book as summer reading for all (about to be) high school sophomores.  We are actually assigned to write a "letter" to Suzanne Collins and explain our thoughts about the ending or an important event in the book that causes us concern.  Though this is a great book, it has terrible, choppy, grammatically incorrect, and simply treacherous sentences scattered among the pages.  It seams as though there are a lot of run-on and fragment sentences, and the sentences don't really flow.  It seams as if the sentences are sometimes disorderly scattered in the paragraphs.  I find Suzanne to repeat a lot of the words she uses to describe actions and feelings often.  I'm not sure if this is due to a lack of vocabulary, or a lack of creativity or a thesaurus.<br /><br />I must say though, that just because the grammar and sentence flow may be horrendous, it is a good book.  You're probably wondering how that can be.  Well, let's just say that there's more to a book than grammar and the fluency of sentences.  The plot seams to keep me interested, as it is different from the other books I have read.  I find at times I can't wait to read what happens next, no matter how predictable it may be at times.  It's sort of like waiting for your favorite part of a movie; You know that what's coming is inevitable, but you can't wait to see it anyway.<br /><br />I don't think I will have difficulty with my school's assignment to critique Collins' work.<br /><br />-Jessica
