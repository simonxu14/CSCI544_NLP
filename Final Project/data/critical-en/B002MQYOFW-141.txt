I read all three novels in the span of three days after completing a semester of a Master's of English program and wanting to read something and not have to over analyze or write on it-- yet here I am, voluntarily writing about a book I had no intentions of even giving a second thought after completing it.  This is how upset I am.<br /><br />The book came highly recommended my friends and family; I was admittedly hesitant to start a new teenie-bopper series after being sucked in to the Twilight Bandwagon Brainwashing a few years ago.  I read the first book in the series and fell in love with Collins' writing style, characters and plot development.  Stephenie Meyer can only hope to write as well as Collins does in the first two novels of this trilogy.  Of course it is a little juvenile as is expected because it is meant for the young adult crowd-- but it is GOOD.  Truly.  One of the better concepts I've seen in both the young adult and adult genres for modern literature.<br /><br />This being said, I am upset by Collins' efforts in the third and final book.  It is as if she felt rushed to finish out the trilogy.  The whole vibe of the book is wrong.  Seriously.  From the first page it does not feel right.  You know?  Collins immediately loses the style, characters and plot I initially fell in love with.  It only gets worse from the first page.  To make a long story short, if I had known that Collins royally butchers the third and final installment leaving me perturbed and bewildered at her choices, I would have never started the series.
