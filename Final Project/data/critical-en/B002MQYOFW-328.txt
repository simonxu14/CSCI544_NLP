Ugh.  This was a train wreck.<br />Here's the train cars involved in the wreckage:<br /><br />* Timelines: Detailed days sandwiched by huge gaps of time.  It's like watching that Tom Cruise movie "Far and Away", when they just magically fast forward six months at a time.  Gappy.<br />* Motives: Some of the characters do *amazingly* irrational or stupid things at times to force fit the story into the desired ending.<br /><br />(Spoilers below)<br />* Characters:  The drama/anguish over which Gale vs. Peeta got worn out in the first book, stupid in the second, and just plain silly in the third.  And it never developed or progressed, until magically resolved itself at the end.<br />* Reality: Boobytrapping an entire city?  That's just friggin' ridiculous.  Suzanne did her darnest to make a third hunger games.  Let it go...<br />* Reality: Shooting down bombers with explosive arrows?  It was dumb in the movie Rambo.  It was dumber here.<br />* Reality: The event that 'causes Katliss pain at the climax ... seriously?  seriously?  that's all you could up with.  so lame.  And in a world with death trap arenas, flying cars, and crazy killer mutations, *that* was the most unbelievable part of the series.<br /><br />It's a pity.  The first book was so good.  Rue's death (and Katliss' visit to District 11) was one of the best scenes I've ever read.<br />But this book?  It was like the author was stung by tracker jackers ... mad, rambling, confusing.<br /><br />I still gave it two stars, because ...<br />* Katliss' speech was epic.<br />* The continued interaction between Pres. Snow and Katliss was chess-matchy enough to warrant note.<br />* At least it brought some conclusion to the story.  It could've been worse - Robert Jordan - worse.<br /><br />To quote Peeta:  Real or not real?<br /><br />*awful*
