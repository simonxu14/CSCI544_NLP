I always feel disappointed at the end of a trilogy or series. That's expected. What it seems like I am usually disappointed about though is not the "end" per sae but how the author tied up all the sub-plots and how strongly he/she kept her characters "in character" right until the bitter end. The ending is the authors choice and I leave them a wide berth (do they go sad? bitter? happy? I'm ok with any of them).<br /><br /> Here is where Collins feel short. Her character development which was SO strong in book 1 and very good in book 2 just sort of fell apart in book 3. In my mind it was VERY much like the last Harry Potter where I felt both authors got rushed, lost momentum/focus and therefore lost the believability/captivation of the reader. So sad because I just adored Katniss's character...one of the best modern female characters I have ever read. In this book she really faded away as weak both mentally and physically which is...out of character. Gale developed nicely I thought (got a better idea of who he is I think?) but then she dropped him in the end in a very out-of-character way. Gale not saying goodbye to Katniss whom he loved dearly? Not ringing true.  Peeta yes was mental for most of the novel but she had a real chance to develop his emergence from being "hijacked" in a believable way and she did not.  As everyone has harped on - the final decision of Peeta with Katniss was awkward. I think Collins felt the reader would be comfortable with a quick wrap up. Maybe she felt we (like her?) knew it was Peeta all along. I think I did personally but I still would have appreciated a more moving conclusion to the romance because the relationship they had was a major draw for me in the novel as it was really developed so realistically and lovingly in the first two.<br /><br />There was an awful lot of killing but it was a novel about war. So, I'm ok with that even though it was graphic. Just like at the end of Harry Potter - some significant characters were killed off quickly and with no real reflection on the loss. As the reader you take it to heart but the writer perhaps doesn't understand how attached we are and like with real people - want the dead honored. That was not done and is a shame.<br /><br />Katniss's mother faded into the background. Katniss's devotion to her district and the people from it was not there. She didn't even realize her old Hob friends were at 13 which seemed odd to me b/c she seemed like a loving community minded girl in the first two books since she provided food for many in the District and her mother provided medial attention. So it seems odd she would turn her back on "old friends."<br /><br />In the end there is not real shape for what the post-Snow post-Coin world will be like. Katniss whom you might have expected to become a leader in the new world (right? she's a leader...she's the Mockingjay!) disappears into a catatonic state for many months hiding in District 12 while Haymitch drinks himself into a stupor again.  So it feels a bit disjointed. I guess based on her character I would have expected her to take a role in forming/advising the new government and Haymitch, Peeta and Gale to all have roles as well.<br /><br />Ah well. Bittersweet ending!
