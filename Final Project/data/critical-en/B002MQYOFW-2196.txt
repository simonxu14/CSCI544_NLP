A very predictable tale which will enrapture sophomoric minds. I would have loved it in fifth grade. But for an adult, it's banal and transparent. Nonetheless, I can see where it will attract hoards of rabid fans, as do the equally trite Steig Larsson snoozefests, making plenty of money for plenty of people for something of very little of merit.
