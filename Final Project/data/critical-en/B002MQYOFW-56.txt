I tore through the first two books recently and then started the third. I knew there was trouble when the first five chapters were a chore to read. It seems as though the author herself didn't really know where she was taking the story. No plan. No forethought. A book about war or revolution should be planned with the same military precision as a war itself would be. I'm fine with the message of the book and indeed who she killed off. It's the writing itself that is so disappointing. The first half of the book is meandering and unfocused. A once strong, brave and inspiring character turned sulky and sullen. Reacting instead of acting. TOO much time is spent in District 13. And the entire book is nearly devoid of emotion. The deaths of really important characters are an afterthought. ******SPOILER ALERT******In the end, Katniss doesn't even choose between Gale and Peeta. Her being with Peeta just ... happens. It seems as though she would have been equally happy marrying Heymitch at that point. Lifeless, emotionless, remarkably revolution-less for a book that's supposed to be about a revolution. I can understand not wanting to glorify war, but at least end in hope. INSPIRE for crying out loud. The girl on fire fizzled to the ground. It honestly broke my heart.
