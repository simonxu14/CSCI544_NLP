Lots of Katniss being protected and mostly by men, or sick in the hospital. Inconsistencies in the characters - plotline choppy. Almost like a sitcom out that resorted to a video game. It will probably make a great soul-less action movie, but loses the integrity of the characters. Sad this often happens to sequels, when the editor becomes afraid to cut the fluff of a successful author. One thing of note---the ending seemed clear, and the last chapters read smooth, like it had been the ending all along, and Collins Judy had to figure out out to get there. Loved the first one, read the second with interest, looked forward to this one and found myself wonder what the author meant to say. Would recommend, but would have preferred a strong Katniss for my daughters to remember. My youngest said &#34;she used to be interesting, now she's just kissing boys...&#34; There you have it;)
