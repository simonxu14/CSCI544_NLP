A severe disappointment after Hunger Games and Catching Fire, and for a very clear reason: Katniss, the teenaged warrior-heroine of the trilogy, isn't allowed to be herself.<br /><br />In addition to being the point-of-view character for this series, Katniss is also its living, beating heart. As long as she's out fighting, rebelling, worrying, wondering, we're right there with her, feeling her pain, celebrating her triumphs, holding our breath as she's about to fall off yet another cliff. Indeed, the series' weakest points come when Katniss is still. In Mockingjay, she's not merely still, she's passive much of the time, not allowed to go out and fight her own fight.<br /><br />Mockingjay has problems other than a smothered heroine. Collins doesn't handle large-scale action effectively; her hand-to-hand combat scenes in the previous books crackled, but anything above squad-level engagement falls flat. A major character just fades away, even though he deserves a much better sendoff. A character close to Katniss -- one who helped start the whole mess -- dies not only offstage but in an almost offhand way.<br /><br />If you read the first two books and just can't stand to not know how it all works out, go ahead and read this. If you want to see what all the fuss is about, go directly to Hunger Games, do not pass "Go".
