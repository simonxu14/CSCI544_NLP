All in all I enjoyed The Hunger Games trilogy.  But this definitely is the weakest book.<br />It feels really rushed, and isn't really a page-turner like the first book.<br />However, it's not like you can read the first two and then not read this one!<br />Don't want to spoil anything, but she ended up with who I wanted her to, so that's good.<br />But I wish Collins would have written a stronger last book for the trilogy, it really seems like this one was half-assed.<br />But, you have to finish the trilogy.....
