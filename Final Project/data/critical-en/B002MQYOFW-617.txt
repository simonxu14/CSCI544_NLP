[Spoilers Ahead]<br /><br />Hunger Games was FANTASTIC.  The story was gripping, shocking, and well planned.<br /><br />Catching Fire was also wonderful.  It met expectations to the next step in Katniss' journey.  It primed the reader to expect great things from Mockingjay.<br /><br />Mocking jay was a good read, period.  At times it was actually boring and tedious.  Not something one would expect from the 3'rd and final book of such a gripping series.  The first two books carry the reader along in a tide of suspense, romance, violence, action, and conflict.  This final book really fizzles out.  Collins focuses way to much on just the internal conflicts of Katniss.  There isn't a lot of room left for what could have been a book packed with epic scenes of struggle and victory at which Katniss was a key player.  Instead you are constantly frustrated as Collins spends an exorbitant amount of time keeping the reader solely in Katniss' despairing and tortured mind.  By the last part of the book the reader just wants to scream at her, "I DON'T CARE!!!"  Such a shame that Collins' didn't spend more time developing the entire story and less time focused solely on the main character's thoughts and feelings.  Don't pay full price for this book, it isn't worth it.  Half price...maybe.
