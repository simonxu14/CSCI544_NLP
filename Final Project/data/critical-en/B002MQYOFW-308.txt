I read this trilogy because my niece raved about it.  Unfortunately as an adult I did not enjoy it at all.  The plot was unrealistic and the characters were shallow.  The end in particular felt rushed and I thought that once it came to the crunch, Katniss proved to be a weak heroine.  However, again my tween niece thought it was wonderful and that is what counts.
