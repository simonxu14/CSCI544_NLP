I realize that I am of the older generation, but as a teacher of Junior High School students for 25 years, I am appalled that so many in our society are comfortable with and rate so highly, books and a movie of 12 to 18 year old children hunting down and killing each other when the obvious reason is for the entertainment of society. (All televised.)  Have we regressed to Roman times when gladiators fought to the death or when people were fed to the lions in the arenas for entertainment of the masses?<br /><br />Why are we so offended by the killing of bulls in bullfighting, killing of dogs or chickens in dog and chicken fighting, but not in the killing of children?  Are we desensitizing our children and our society even more than what our vicious, violent movies are doing?  Just remember, when we devalue life so, it will be easier for the young to not only kill each other, but also the elderley, the infirm, etc.
