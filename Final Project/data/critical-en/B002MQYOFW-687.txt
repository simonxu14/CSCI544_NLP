I read the Hunger Games trilogy a couple years ago and tore through them all. I loved the first 2 (have watched the movies) and remembered liking Mockingjay okay enough. So a couple years have passed and then I read the Divergent trilogy, and it is the new Big Thing. I despised Allegiant and it brought me back to thinking about Mockingjay, and I found this article from Buzzfeed that really nails it. They are going to have a tough time making these last two movies likable to the masses. I had forgotten how miserable and depressing this book was. I "get it," but I still don't like it. I read to escape, not to be depressed. Real life is already plenty depressing enough. I am going to list some of the things the Buzzfeed article (written by Adam B. Vary) talks about. I totally agree with him and had forgotten how miserable and depressing this book was.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />* Katniss becomes a passive participant in the events around her.<br />* Finnick, Johanna, and Effie are AWOL for the most part.<br />* Then, in another scene later in the book, Finnick just unnecessarily quickly dies.<br />* Peeta is "hijacked" and brainwashed and tries to kill Katniss (and THEN Katniss marries him with little joy and has no role in helping rebuild her country).<br />* Prim dies.<br />* After two books of wondering about Katniss and Gale ever being together, they just drift apart.<br />* Squad 451's actions end up having nothing to do with the ending of the war.<br />* Katniss doesn't kill President Snow, who has been built up through the books as such a horrible villain and has tortured her friends.
