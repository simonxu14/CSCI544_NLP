Other than the fact that Katniss ends up with the person I wanted her to, this book is s*** compared to the other two. I have a feeling she wrote the book before they gave her the page limit, then she had to cut a BUNCH of stuff out, which left me thinking... I have a hard time believing that would happen, and no one seems to care/notice. (That doesn't make a lot of sense, but I'm trying to avoid using spoilers) Obviously I recommend reading this to finish the series, but be warned, you WILL hate the ending, and more than likely you'll hate the book. However, it does not ruin the series by any means. Let's just be happy they're doing this movie in two parts.
