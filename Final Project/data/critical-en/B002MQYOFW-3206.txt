The story is absurd. The world has collapsed and North America is divided into fenced ghettos. Each year a boy and girl from each ghetto are sent to the dominant territory to fight to the death. Technically they are picked at random but substitution is allowed. Technically they are not supposed to train, but many do. One of the entrants is a young girl with no "training" except that her ghetto raises apples and she has learned to jump from tree to tree like a squirrel while "picking apples". Not a very efficient way to actually get apples out of a tree.<br />It is not good science fiction and it is weak fantasy. As a teen romance novel it must work based on its popularity, but it's been a while since I was a teen and it just left a bad taste in my mouth
