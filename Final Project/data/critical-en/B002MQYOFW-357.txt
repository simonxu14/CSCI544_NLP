I am an avid fan of this trilogy. Once I started I could not stop until I had finished all three books. That was until about the last 50 pages of Mockingjay. No spoilers here, but I simply refuse to believe that it was written by the same person who evoked so much emotion from me in the first 2.5 books. Disappointed is a shocking understatement when it comes to describing how I felt about the ending. Not because it was happy or sad, but because it was poorly delivered and pressed for time. Gale, Haymitch, Finnick, Peeta, Prim and Katniss deserved a much more epic ending to their tragic tale.
