I loves the first two Hunger Games books. I just felt like Mockingjay was too long. It was okay, but it felt like an obligatory third book ( which I guessing was, being a trilogy). That being said, if you have read the first two books, you need to read Mockingjay as well to tie up the loose strings in the series. Mockingjay was, unlike the Hunger Games and Catching Fire, a book I was able to put down.
