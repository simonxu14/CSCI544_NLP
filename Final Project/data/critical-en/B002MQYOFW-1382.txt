After hearing rave reviews from my daughter (14) and friends, I thought I should check it out.<br /><br />What a waste. In this setting, the author had the opportunity to crrate a strong, independent young woman. Instead, we are presented by a selfish and surly 16 year old girl (like that is anything new) whose only redeeming quality is that she volunteers to take her younger sister's place in the Games.<br /><br />Spoiler alert<br /><br />Fast forward to the Games themselves. Our heroine is so self involved that she does not recognize a profession of love when she hears it. Further, throughout the book, Katniss despises the Capital and the Games, yet when she has a chance to make a difference, she simply does as she is told. Act like you love him, too. So she does, never considering how Peeta actually feels. Put on a show for the audience. So she does. Your life is in danger - some in the Capital think you have been disrespectful to their tyranny, so snuggle up against Peeta and look lovey-dovey. And guess what? She does.<br /><br />Our heroine is anything but heroic. The author had a chance to create a role model. Instead we are left with a broken-hearted hero and a (giving her the ultimate benefit of the doubt) conflicted girl.<br /><br />Finally, the ending .... Instead of "end of book one," the author should have been more honest and written, "get ready to pony up more dough for the next installment." I don't mind a sequel; I just don't like paying for a whole book and getting half of a story.
