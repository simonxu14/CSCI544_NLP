The book is not a masterpiece of literature but it is a highly entertaining young adult book with dark themes and violence and the exploration of dystrophy that adults can enjoy as well. It's an easy read with a fast pace and high entertainment factor. The writing style is geared towards young adult readers but is smooth and polished, with content that is meant for the high school level and above. It's told in present tense, which amps up the tension and cements the reader in the current moment. I appreciated the well-handled elements of horror and sci-fi along with the strong feminism that many current romance-driven books seem to lack. There is much more to Katniss than romance; in fact, she herself admits that romance is the least of her concerns right now, as it should be. She doesn't want to get married, and she doesn't want to bring children into the world only to have them potentially get pulled for the Hunger Games. I like this girl. This is a heroine I can get behind.
