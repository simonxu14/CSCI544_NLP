Sorry if the following makes you upset I just get really disappointed when something popular fails so miserably.  It pushes me over the edge.  It feels like the publisher and author knew that it was going to sell no matter what so they just put out a first draft as quickly as they could. When reading the trilogy you should stop at the second book and then just make up your own ending.<br /><br />Do I need to go explain or will you just trust me?<br /><br />I can tell from the way you are reading this that you need me to explain. You have probably heard from a lot of your friends that the entire trilogy is awesome and that the third book is the best of the bunch. Feel free to keep reading but don't say I didn't warn you.<br /><br />You are probably wondering how bad it is so I'll ask you a question to try and show you.<br /><br />How do you win a revolution?<br /><br />If you answered "Fight to overthrow the government" then you would be right. We've all seen Star Wars. We know the good guys fight the bad guys until the evil government is gone.<br /><br />That's not what happens in Mockingjay. There is fighting going on but rarely from the protagonist's POV.<br /><br />Instead they have her making propaganda commercials.<br /><br />What?<br /><br />It's like reading the behind the scenes of a negative political ad campaign, except way more frustrating because you know there is a war going on that would be way more entertaining than reading about how to make commercials. So lame.<br /><br />The revolution is on the back burner for most of the book. Instead the focus is on the commercials, Katniss having a hard life because of blah blah whatever, and her choosing between Pita Pit and the other guy (I've already forgotten his name).<br /><br />Katniss being sad about her life is just about the most boring thing in the world to read. I don't care if that's what she would be like in real life. It is boring and I don't want to read about. The districts are rising up against their oppressors, why can't we read more about that?<br /><br />When we finally get to the action it's vague and unimaginative. There was never a moment when I could picture what was going on in my head or a moment when , after a minute or two, I couldn't think of something more interesting. Instead of being creative and entertaining the author resorted to being unnecessarily gory when characters finally started dying.<br /><br />Don't even get me started with Prim. That was supposed to be a major turning point in the book? Was that a climax? Instead of storming the castle we have to read that? Are you kidding me? I don't know what's worse, having to read that or reading it and not caring in the slightest.<br /><br />But it's not all bad. There was one lonely improvement in this book from the other ones. Pita Pit wasn't just some star-crossed lover who never did anything. In this book he is a crazy person who can't tell reality from what he was brainwashed to believe. The real or fake game they play to help him learn what's real was the only part of the book I thought was good.<br /><br />Do you want to know the very worst thing about this book?<br /><br />It's been optioned for two movies.  As with all young adult books being turned into movies it will be split into two so instead of one unwatchable movie we are going to have two.  Nothing happens in the first half of the book. I can't imagine what the movie is going to be about.  If I end up watching it I might have to download a new iPhone game to keep me amused.  By the way, Angry Birds tells a better and more interesting story than Mockingjay.<br /><br />You've been warned. This book is no good. But chances are if you read the first two than you will read this one. I'm sorry in advance.
