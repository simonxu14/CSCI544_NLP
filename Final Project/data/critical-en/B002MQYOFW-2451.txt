I want to add to the low star ratings for this book by submitting a review of it so that our literary voices can be heard.  If you read many of the low star reviews, they are very well written, insightful, and well thought out criticisms.  Most of those criticisms I agree with and I am not going to reiterate all of them here. I highly recommend reading some of the other 1 and 2 star reviews to get a very good perspective on the quality of this book.<br /><br />When I read Mockingjay, my reaction was that the 1st person perspective was a failure.  Since Katniss was so mentally broken, we as readers were trapped in the limbo that was her mind, waiting for something to happen with the plot.  I was completely disappointed with Katniss's character development.  She was not a strong character, she didn't grow, and she didn't overcome.  She was broken by her experiences.  I don't feel she even found any peace or reconciliation in her life.  She didn't strengthen her relationships with her mother or Peeta.  She was just existing by the end.  While I do agree that this is probably closer to reality it makes for a pretty depressing, fatalistic read.  I also agree that the end of the book was rushed and it felt more like an outline for the movie script than a complete novel.  OH!  They did make a movie, didn't they :).  I read the book before any of the movies came out.  I literally closed the book and yelled &#34;Suzanne Collins has already signed the movie deal and just wanted to finish the book quick in order to get her check!&#34;  I was pretty mad.<br /><br />Since part 1 of the last movie in the trilogy came out, I have been so hesitant to see it since I disliked the book so much.  But I have been reassured by other's reviews that the movie is a much better product than the book and fixes many of the problems the book has (at least up to the half way mark).  We'll see.  I'm renting it tonight.
