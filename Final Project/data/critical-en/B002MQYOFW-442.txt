I don't think Collins knows how to write unless her characters are in the Hunger Games. It wasn't a horrible book, it was just without any sort of real direction. She tried, but the ending is a let-down. Where did Katniss, the girl who is on fire, go? Having your heroine lose all of her spunk 10 pages into the last book does not bode well for a conclusion.
