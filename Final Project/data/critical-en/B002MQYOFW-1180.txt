The continuous whining, insecurity, and selfishness of Katniss was somewhat bearable in the first two books. I was hoping the author would mature her a little, as going through two Hunger Games would mature anybody. Not Katniss! She is constantly whining. She was my least favorite character in the whole book. The author has completely failed to portray her as the Che Guevara of Panem. She is more like the Paris Hilton of Panem.<br /><br />Also, the cheap trick of ending each chapter with a shocking revelation, got be be detestable. I thought maybe the author would stop her impersonation of M. Night Shyamalan, and just concentrate on writing the book rather than try really hard to give us a shocking twist in every chapter. It is extremely annoying that each chapter ends with some "shocking" twist. The author does not take time to develop the death of a character, but merely uses them as a cheap trick to lure you into the next chapter.<br /><br />If you are the type of person who likes the Vampire Diares and so on, this book is for you. I say that without any judgement, or pretentiousness. This book is not for the advanced reader.<br /><br />If the rebels needed someone like Katniss (what an ugly name for a heroine) in order to throw off slavery, then they deserved to be under Snow.
