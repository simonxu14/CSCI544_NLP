this was a horrible book! I'm very dissapointed in Susan Collins. i loved the hunger games and catching fire, but most of this book was absolutely terrible. she ruined the end the most! i means killing some of the charaters that were there from the beggining. (im not saying who ;^] ) and the ending was very bland, it just feels like there needs to be a second series, because it felt like the was no ending. so i say this was an altogether bad book, Thank You
