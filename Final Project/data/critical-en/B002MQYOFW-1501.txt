So I'm halfway through the first book and so far, I must say, I'm not disappointed. I am, however, Disappointed at the condition of the catching fire book... I'd like to know why in the hell the Cover is sliced down the middle, as if a razor has been taken to it. if that's not bad enough, when I took it off to look at the hardback of the book, it's been sliced too. I love the books, and that's not the reason for the low rating, It's because the book was in used condition-- which is strange, considering the pack was warped up and all.
