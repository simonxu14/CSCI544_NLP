This book, to me, is the equivalent to the horribleness that is "Breaking Dawn" to the Twilight franchise. Heartwrenchingly terrible. Don't get me wrong, it was well written and you get sucked into the story, hoping your favorite characters stay alive. Most of them don't though. And the ones that do, are just an empty shell of a character after all the torture the war has put them through. I wish I never read this book. Peeta and Katniss I hold so close to my heart since I'm an uber-fan, and this book just shattered those characters. WTH! Why? Just read The Hunger Games and Catching Fire and leave it at that!!
