******* ATTENTION: THIS IS NOT A PROFFESIONAL REVIEW. I'M A REGULAR READER, OTHERWISE JUST ANOTHER WOMAN FROM AROUND THE CORNER**********************<br /><br />I downloaded a sample on my Kindle, and couldn't stop reading. So I bought the Trilogy, and I couldn't stop reading, until... it just got boring. I found myself skipping pages at the end, getting lost in eternal descriptions of mental states.<br /><br />The characters are too irreal, Katniss has too much testosterona for being a woman.<br /><br />PROS: great hook in the start, and you don't know who will she choose, until the end (if ever)<br />CONS: repetitive descriptions of madness and thoughts, and the lenght is too much. Only very good books are allowed to be so long.<br /><br />To finish, I would like to apologize about my English (it is not my first language), and thank you for your time.
