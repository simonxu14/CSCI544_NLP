I imagine this book would go down well with readers who enjoyed the twilight series. It revolved around a girl who battles with relationships and emotions in a post-apocolyptic USA with the usual evil, corrupt government supressing the ordinary citizens. She has to deal with family issues until she is plucked away to participate in a deadly fight to the death. The story is more about her appearance and emotional battles than any real action and in my opinion fails to deliver any real impact in either area. While it was midly entertaining, the story was very predictable from start to finish and didn't grip with suspense so I felt somewhat dissapoointed in that much more could have been done with it.
