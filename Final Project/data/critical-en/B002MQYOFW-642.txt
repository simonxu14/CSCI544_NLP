I didn't think it would be so strange. Could not make out what the book was trying to bring across to the readers.<br />Is it a science fiction or have people from another planet have settled there ..?<br /><br />Anyway I did not enjoy the book at all.  Sorry most of your books I order in kindle have been a jpy to read . jenny.
