The book would be beautiful, however it arrived damaged.  The shipping box it arrived in looked good so I was totally surprised by the amount of damage to the book.  There is a large dent in the back hard cover that is not repairable (it looks like it was hit along the edge with a hammer) and the dust jacket is ripped right across the front.  Prior to purchasing I read other similar reviews about the book being damaged upon arrival and thought people were exaggerating.  How wrong I was.  Not sure what is going on Amazon.  I've never had a problem ordering items in the past, but this was really disappointing given the similar reviews and what seems could be an easy fix.
