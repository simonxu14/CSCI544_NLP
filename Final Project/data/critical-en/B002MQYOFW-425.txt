**SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />Honestly...to invest so much time reading this trilogy, the entire last half of the 3rd book was a serious disappointment.  It was obvious the author was tired of the story herself and rushed to finish it.  This completely ruined her for me.  I doubt that I will read anymore of her books.  Why should I?  Only to get invested in the characters and have the ending rushed and not even completed?  I became attached to the characters, only to have some of them to pointlessly die in the end with minimal details or emotion.  And some of them were barely mentioned in the end, like Gale, who was a huge part of Katniss's life.  Yeah...the author said Gale got a great job in another district...but that's it.  Very dry...and it made Gale sound insignificant despite his huge part throughout the trilogy.  Throughout the book, it would have been great if the author let him meet another girl and show alittle interest in her so that we would know he would be okay without Katniss loving him back.  It would have been a much better story if the author had taken her time and included more details and a more complete ending.  I haven't been this disappointed in years...
