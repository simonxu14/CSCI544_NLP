Light reading that was entertaining most of the time but its premise is too unbelievable for me. The plot description is already well described so I won't go too far in here. Just that a society as a whole would accept and enjoy watching innocent children fight to the death as a punishment for crimes committed by a distant past culture (the contest in the story is 74 years or so after the rebellion) is treated too lightly. Too make this work more believably needs much more explanation than we get, which of course is why the book fits the YA description. This story has been told before (elements of Running Man and others) so a more detailed explanation as to the how and why this is still a necessary punishment is in order. I also wasn't pleased with the way the book ends. This is written as a trilogy but being forced to buy book two to end a story I invested time in buying and reading is simply marketing strategy. A worthy trilogy sells on its merit not a cliff hanger without substance.
