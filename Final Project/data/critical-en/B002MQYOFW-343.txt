I enjoyed the Hunger Games very much and Catching Fire was also good.  This book is terrible.  The author appears to have slapped together an outline that did not work, fleshed it out with some drama between the main characters that does nothing to move the story along and then moved the characters through some very unlikely scenes until she could not figure out how to bring it all to conclusion.  At that point deux ex machina - everything is wrapped up while the lead character is in hospital.  I am glad I stopped reading (way too late) and switched to reading a summary.  This is one of the worst books I have ever read.
