I typically don't read from the young adult genre because I find that the language and themes are too &#34;dumbed down&#34; and the genre is not often challenging enough to hold my interest but this was a pleasant surprise.<br />Although there are times where the author does &#34;tell, not show&#34; (the cardinal sin of good writing), I was engaged enough with the plot and the pacing that I was able to overlook the heavy-handedness of some of the themes.
