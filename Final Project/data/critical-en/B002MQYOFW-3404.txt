As each chapter of "The Hunger Games" ended, I felt no eager anticipation to know what would happen next in the story. It all felt so contrived, unbelievable and dark, and trudging the strange writing style only added to uneasy feeling I experienced while reading the book. I know many young people who rave about the story. Perhaps, it is aimed for a younger crowd - like artificially-flavored fruit snacks.
