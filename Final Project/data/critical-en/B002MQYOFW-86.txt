I was surprisingly taken in by Hunger Games. It was no Harry Potter, but it was very readable. Plotting was good, characters were mostly well-rounded, a satisfying finish when they outwit Snow.<br /><br />Second book was not as good, but still readable. Quarter Quell seemed like a giant cheat/cop-out, but it was interesting to see how she played the resistance and fighting scenes between all the prior winners.<br /><br />Mockingjay....ugh. A seemingly random assortment of torture, stupid military 'missions,' Kat whining, child murder, assassination. The series turned from a fairly entertaining YA adaptation of Battle Royale into a somber, turgid, anti-war polemic with a tacked-on even more depressing ending of Kat/Peeta at age ~37.<br /><br />Of course you're still going to read it. Just prepared for the inevitable disappointment.
