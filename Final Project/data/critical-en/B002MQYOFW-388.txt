Okay. I really did not like this book. Oh, it's well written and all, but I did not like the way it ended. I really wanted this whole Hunger Games Trilogy to end a little more up beat than this. Sorry...I like happier endings. Love the character of Katness, but not Peta. Still, I'm glad I have this set of books in my Kindle. I will read them again and perhaps grow to like this third book. It may take awhile.
