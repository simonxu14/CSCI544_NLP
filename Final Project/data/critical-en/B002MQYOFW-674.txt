I'll skip the fluff and go straight to the point, Collins retains her natural ability of getting the reader to keep reading with few pauses before finishing, but struggles to end the magnificent series in a way that would give it justice.<br /><br />All that is on the outside (the war, Panem, government) is resolved with great closure and is put away nicely within the last few chapters with a few twists and turns that Collins loves to throw at the reader. It's what's on the inside that is left untouched. Katniss, despite multiple conversations within the book itself exclaiming that this isn't true, undergoes absolutely no change whatsoever between the end of the first book and the end of the series.<br /><br />The original Hunger Games was written with such mastery and while I undoubtedly enjoyed the other two books, I knew something was missing. Something didn't quite stick with the last two that stuck with the first. I now know what that is, and it is very cleverly disguised within such great character development from supporting characters. It was the change that Katniss did not undergo. In the beginning of the very first book, Katniss was presented to the reader as an unimportant peasant in the mistreated District 12, at the end, she is a nationwide phenomenon. At the beginning of Catching Fire, she is a symbol of rebellion, at the end of Mockingjay, this public view doesn't change. And while this outside view does not dictate how Katniss develops internally, it does have an impact, and that I believe is what Collins failed to realize.<br /><br />One last bone to pick with this, the ending seemed a bit hurried for the massive turn of events that happened. She does an "inexplicable act" as we'll call it to avoid spoilers, and then 2 pages later all is forgotten and an "oh well, we'll let you slide for the 1000th time" mood is established. After another 2 page flip, the end.<br /><br />Collins did succeed on some levels though. I think the way she handled Peeta, Finnick, and Annie throughout the novel is worth a ton of praise. Finnick went through an absolute metamorphosis in this book. Peeta went to hell and back in such detail, and Annie is so symbolic of everything Finnick loved in his life. Well done on that front. The best part of the final novel however is how the deaths of characters are presented. With the exception of one (and the most important, again, trying to avoid spoilers), all the deaths are presented in a way where you feel sorry for all of those that die, no matter how unimportant they were. The details of their final moments are portrayed in such a haunting way that it really sticks with you each time someone passes.<br /><br />Overall, I'd put this one last in the series, but that's not to say it is bad. The ending could have had some work, and Katniss' character left some holes in the reader's head, but it is definitely worth a read for those who enjoyed the first or second book in the series. Collins ended the series right when she should have, when it was losing steam. The first book deserves a full 5*, while the second deserves 4*, and now the third deserves 3*.
