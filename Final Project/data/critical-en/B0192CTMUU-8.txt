I purchased a copy of Harry Potter and The Goblet Of Fire, and was under the impression that it was a United Kingdom Bloomsbury first edition upon receiving the book although it is a Bloomsbury publication it is a Canadian first edition, first print. This type of confusion could be avoided if book sellers were required to state these specifics or provide a clear photo of the copyright page in the book being offered.
