no idea. he hasn't read it yet. too much video, what a shame. I'm thinking he doesn't like it.  Unlike our other grandson who has read every one at least three times!  Although the newest book I must say he did not like the format. that play idea was a mistake..it takes away the falling into the story as if you are there. what a shame to wait so long for something and be so excited and then boom...He reads 3 grades above his grade level so it's not like he couldn't understand it, it just took the joy away.
