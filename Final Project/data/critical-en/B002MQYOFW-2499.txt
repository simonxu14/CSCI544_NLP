I read this trilogy in a week.  The first book kept me wanting more, as soon as I was done I started the second, only to be disappointed by the third.  Mockingjay felt rushed, I had to keep rereading paragraphs just to try to keep up with what was going on.  I agree with other's reviews about Katniss' depression and her giving up on everything was really not her.  This character was a fighter from the start and she was broken so easily in the third book.  Just didn't seem like the same character.  I love a happy ending but I felt so sorry for Peeta's character in the end.
