The last book of of the Hunger Games was kind of a let down. The first two books were terrific, I couldn't put them down, but this last one, not so much. The ending was rushed, so much so that the last chapters are confusing and a disapointment. Katness finally starts going to war on page 255 and the book only has 390 pages in it. You've been expecting this war from book 2 and especially from third, and it is kind of a let down. If you have read the first 2 books my advice would be to wait for this book to go on sell, or borrow it form the library. It isn't one I would rush out to get.
