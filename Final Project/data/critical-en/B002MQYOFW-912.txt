I was bitterly disappointed with the third installment of this series. I enjoyed the first two books immensely. I can't believe the author chose to end the series by killing Prim and making Katniss look like a pathetic loser. After everything the heroine had been thru, instead of letting her shine at the end, you just kept kicking her while she was down. I think it is a great story and could have been SO much better if Katniss had been written into the hero people expected!
