I quit watching TV years ago and stared just reading. Life is too short to watch TV.  This book is actually worse than the dribble on TV!  No writing skill...no believable plot..no creative ending.  It reads like a high school sophomore wrote it with no imagination and no skills.  I kept telling myself it would get better...it never did. I was ashamed that I wasted my time and finished it.
