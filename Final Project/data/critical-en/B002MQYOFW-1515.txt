I started reading this book with high hopes and was kept on edge for most of it. Mockingjay was entertaining, but unlike the first two in the series, it had three major flaws.<br /><br />First complaint- Katniss is clearly at a breaking point in this book and since Mockingjay is written in the first person, it is sometimes hard to discern whether she is dreaming, delusional, or sane and I found myself having to reread a couple paragraphs to fully understand what was going on. But I suppose Collins did this intentionally for the reader to better understand the duress Katniss was under.<br /><br />Second- The ending was abrupt and left me wondering, "huh...that's it?" My initial response was of complete disappointment. I wanted a happy ending. But the more I thought about it, the ending was quite fitting and appropriate for the underlying main message of Collin's series- the ravages of war and how nobody wins when there is merciless fighting. And she clearly points out how some damages are irrevocable, but life does move on. So, the ending was disappointing but appropriate.<br /><br />Third- There were questions left unanswered. I found there were too many new characters who found just enough attention in the book but who were not fully addressed or explained. Mainly, I expected more information about President Coin and what her true intentions were, who she was working with, etc. But I'm thinking maybe there wasn't an underlying conspiracy with Coin but more of a display of how human nature does not change.<br /><br />All in all, the book is entertaining and does give an adequate closure to the series. It's just not as thrilling or satisfying as the first two.
