The book is not what I was expecting, and I sent it back. I thought I was ordering the larger book with the dust jacket, and this was a much smaller book with no dust jacket. There were also a few (very subtle) impression marks, like scratches, on the cover, even though the book was supposed to be brand new. I cannot figure out which of the Harry Potter series books listed on Amazon are the larger ones with dust jackets vs which are like this one was, so I will have to get them elsewhere.
