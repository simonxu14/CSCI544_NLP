Product was as described and as requested but was damaged on arrival. Upon further inspection it appears as UPS damaged the box in shipping. Very little packing material used to secure the contents of the box. the box shows very minimal sings of corner dropping but the interior contents suffered significantly. This was for my girlfriend who is a book collector and it was very disappointing to open the books and have the case corner highly damaged, one book corner highly damaged and the middle book corner slightly damaged. I will be putting in a claim with UPS or requested a return or exchange if possible.
