The product was listed as being in very good condition, but when it came it looked as if it had been tightly banded in three spots around the hardbound cover to the point of indentations in three spots both on the top and the bottom.  I sent an email to the seller and asked that they ship me a replacement copy, but have never had that request responded to.  Very disappointing.  My son wanted the Harry Potter series for a collection, and now he has one book out of the whole series that is in less than hoped for condition.
