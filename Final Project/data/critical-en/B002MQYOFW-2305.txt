I adore reading and picked up the entire trilogy due to all the rave reviews from pretty much everyone I know. It was okay. I definitely don't understand why everyone thinks this is the greatest book ever. I haven't even touched the second one. It is currently at the bottom of my list of books to read, and it may never get read as I am sure I will buy more books before I get to it.
