I have waited awhile to give this review, I give it 2 1/2 stars which you cant do on amazon. So here goes. I read the first two books with gausto I loved Katniss, she was strong and enduring the way that she saved her sister from the games. In comes Mockingjay.... Lets see Katniss run and hide and get doped up throughout the book then lets read about a huge amount of people dying and Katniss runs some more. You see slight glimpses of her old self in some passages of the book but not really. The way Suzanne Collins basicaly describes Katniss is selfish (as told through Gales and Pitas view). And then she has the freakin GAll to kill Primm (WHAT THE HELL) I mean really, REALLY. After all Katniss went through to save Primm from the Games she ends up dying from a bomb that Gale makes, and then ops for the Games to start again (one more time). It just makes my head spin and then Katniss goes nutts again... WOW So all in all I hated this book ruined the series for me RUINED it. I was so darn excited when this came out I read it in one day from front to back then it let me down terribly. But I will shut up now. I loved the first two books I really still do.
