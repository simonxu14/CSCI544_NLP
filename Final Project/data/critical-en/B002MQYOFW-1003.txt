I started this seriesTuesday and here I sit on Friday night having read all three books.  This book has its moments.  It was very slow in the beginning, maybe too much time spent in District 13 and not enough time spent on the conclusion of whom she finally decides to be with.  It ended rather abruptly.  I give it three stars because I got bored reading half way through and put the book down.  With Hunger Games and Catching Fire I pretty much read straight through.  However, I am pleased with her choice between Peeta and Gale.
