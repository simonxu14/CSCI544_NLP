I want to start out by saying that I loved the first two books in the series and couldn't wait to read Mockingjay.  This book moved rather slowly for me and I was bored at times reading it.  Just when the book started to move along and get my attention the author did a cop out in the writing.  Everything was building up and then bam the story just fast forwards and skips what the book had been leading up to.  I wish the author had added some more chapters and provided a complete book.
