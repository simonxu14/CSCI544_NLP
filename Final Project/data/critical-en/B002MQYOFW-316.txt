I feel like this is one of those books that is worshipped by people who don't really read books. It had rave reviews, and it falls within my reading preferences (I love me some dystopian sci-fi), and it sounded like basically a fancier version of Battle Royale. So I got the trilogy.<br /><br />The first book is dull, dull, dull. It's especially painful to read through Katniss' struggles to survive the Hunger Games because if you have even glanced a the sequels, you already know who's going to live. Skip it, read a synopsis, and go straight to the second one.<br /><br />In the second one, nearly all the interesting things happen. Political machinations! An underground revolution! A really tortured romance subplot! When I got going in the second one, I was grateful that I'd bought the trilogy three-pack, because otherwise I would have had absolutely no motivation to continue reading. The second book made me glad I kept going.<br /><br />The third book... was mostly good. Everything runs out of steam near the end. The differences between good guys and bad guys break down, and throughout the series Katniss is never more than a tool of greater powers. The existential angst at the end made the rest of the series seem kind of pointless.<br /><br />All in all, the setting is interesting, and the characters are pretty well-fleshed out, but the ending doesn't provide any closure and the storyline isn't particularly striking. I wouldn't call it a bad book, but I'm curious what amazing work of literature all the other reviewers have been reading.
