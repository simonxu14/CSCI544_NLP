I found myself fighting and pushing my way through this book, and at 60% I finally gave up and had my girlfriend tell me the ending.  I am glad now I stopped trying.  I got annoyed quickly with how self-absorbed Katniss was and her constant bitching over pointless things was over the top.  The first two books were a lot better, but my advice is to stop there and leave the rest to your imagination.
