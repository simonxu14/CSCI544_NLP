I have started this review a number of times.  I just couldn't figure out how to put into words what I has feeling.  I absolutely loved&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Hunger-Games/dp/0439023521/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Hunger Games</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Catching-Fire-The-Second-Book-of-the-Hunger-Games/dp/0439023491/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)</a>.  I went so far as to call the Hunger Games on of the best books written since Harry Potter.  So I struggled on how to word my disappointment.<br /><br />Some spoilers below:<br />The Mockingjay picks up after Catching Fire.  Katniss is back in District 13 in their undergraound lair where the rebellion is being planned.  Peeta was captured is still in the district.<br /><br />Katniss is healing from her physical injuries.  But the Katniss of the first two books seems dead and gone.  In her place is a broody, withdrawn, mopey girl.  What I loved about Katniss was that she often times would take action with little thought.  Her family and friends her a driving force in her life...she joined the Hunger Games to protect her sister, she worried about Gale's safety and feelings, as well as Peeta's, and while her relationship with her mother was hard, there was a caring beneath it.<br /><br />So Katniss hides in a closet...that's right, she has no interest in planning the rebellion that might save Peeta, she has no intrest in talking to Gale or her sister?  Where is the old Katniss?<br /><br />The rebellion decides to save Peeta to stop her moping...putting at risk soldiers, including Katniss' friends just to make her happy.  And when Peeta comes back, he is mentally broken and tries to kill her....so what does Katniss do, she mopes around ignoring her friends and family and start filming PSA messages for the rebels?<br /><br />I will skip ahead a little and say she finally wants to get out of District 13.  She is sent to a district still battling with the capitals forces...but Katniss hides in the background because she is too valuable to be hurt.  The Katniss we met at the Hunger Games used to go hunting and supply food for her family and many in District 12 despite it being against the law and punishable by death....so now Katniss is ok with others doing the fighting while she hides in the background?<br /><br />When she finally decides she won't take it anymore and wants to fight, she is put in a military group that is for show rather than one actually fighting...and finally we start to see a glimer of the old Katniss as she starts planning on how to make it through the Capital by herself to end this war and kill the president....<br /><br />To sum up the rest of the book (and my complaints, Peeta is assigned to same unit as Katniss.  Even if you want to play with the mental game Collins seems to want you to, it makes little sense.  Collins want you to believe that the president of District 13 has assigned Peeta to the team to kill Katniss because Katniss is a political threat to her.  If we go down this path of thinking, why did she have her people work to get Peeta sane again in the first place?  And wouldn't that be political suicide for her anyway.  Everyone knows Peeta was crazy and tried to kill Katniss...the president assigning the murderer of the country's hero to the same unit would be obvious to everyone.<br /><br />Finnegan died quickly and anticlimatic.  This was a survivor of 2 Hunger Games who was a strong warrior.  He also became a fairly big character in the books.  I wasn't expecting every character to make it through the war but his death just seemed quick and anticlimatic in every way.<br /><br />The idea that Primm was sent to be a front line medic when she was so young makes no sense.  Wouldn't her mother have been sent first?  I understand that this is the conspiracy theory but the idea alone is implausible...also to kill the children to turn public opinion against the president seems like an idea full of holes...so then for this idea to work, the rebellion had to have round all the children in the capital, placed them infront of the presidents house, had rebelion members dressed as guards to keep the kids there...it is the only way the plan could work...all while the president and capital guards didn't notice and done without tripping any traps?  Uhmmm...ok<br /><br />Finally, since the first book the idea of the love triangle has been a undercurrent.  So instead of making Katniss choose, she is exiled to District 12...Gale becomes a politician in District 2 and never calls or visits and Peeta is sent to District 12 to...so her choice is a matter of conveinence and availability?<br /><br />It was just not a good ending to a series that had so much promise.
