I don't understand everyone's fascination with these books and movies.  I don't find anything entertaining about the fact that a child is forced to fight for her and her families lives to the death for food.  How horrible and morbid.  Don't get it and couldn't get past the 2nd chapter.  Snooze-fest and annoying.
