The first two books were great until you get to the end.  It was like she did everything for nothing and lost more at the end.  I enjoy a great read and death that come with it.  However, it felt as though the Mrs. Collins gave up at the end and really didn't know where or how to end it on good note.  I don't think I will be buying any more of her books in the future, don't get me wrong I like twist and turn of any good story.  I just notice that some author start off great and wither out at the last book.  Maybe it's pressure from the publisher or whatever.  I wish it would have ended with a bang instead of a people dropping like flies.
