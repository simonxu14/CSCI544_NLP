Like the second book, Mockingjay was more of the same old same old.  I.E. Katniss and her never ending moral debates in her head.  She feels guilty because she might want to preserve her own life, etc.<br /><br />Life in the District 13 underground colony was a cool insight into that sort of thing, and like the other two books Mockingjay was a fast and somewhat exciting read.<br /><br />Primrose dying was a dose of reality for myself and probably many other readers, and I'm glad Katniss killed President Coin because she was probably almost as bad as Snow.<br /><br />Like I said not terrible...
