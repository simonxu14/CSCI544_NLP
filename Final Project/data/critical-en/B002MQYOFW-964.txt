I really enjoyed reading this book as a series, but thought that the first and second books were better than the third. I think the use of propaganda on both sides (the Capitol and the rebels) was very interesting and really representative of how certain groups constantly manipulate stories and messages to glorify their actions, pacify an audience, and have more control over the way people think. The characters were well written and interesting and, overall, it made for a very fun and entertaining read.
