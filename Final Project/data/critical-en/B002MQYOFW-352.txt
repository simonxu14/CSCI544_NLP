While I was pleased with the ending, getting through this book was painful.  I felt there was about 2 good pages per chapter to read.  This was not a "can't put this book down" kind of book.  What got me through is #1 because it's a trilogy and I had to finish it and #2 because I was told it gets better.  I even looked up to see what happens to see if it was really worth completing it.  Catching Fire was definitely the best book of the collection, would have been nice to extend the book and just finished it there.
