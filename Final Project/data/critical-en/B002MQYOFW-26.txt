I was completely engrossed in the first book and finished the second in just a day. When I got to the third I found myself having a hard time getting through it but I thought maybe it was because I had been reading so much over the last few days that I was just burnt out. In reality, it was just disappointing and lacked the personality of the first two books where you really could connect with the characters and feel their pain.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert...<br /><br />When Prim abruptly appears and then subsequently dies just as abruptly, I was waiting for it all to be a nightmare only to have Katniss wake up but she never did. It seemed pointless to bring her in at that moment and make her death such a quick and almost insignificant part of the story when the whole book started with Katniss taking her place to save her life.<br /><br />Then we have Peeta who you'd expect Katniss to fight for, as she did in the other two books but this time because she truly loved him, because she owed him the kindness he always showed her. But then the fact that they end up  together just seems like an afterthought. It is almost like Collins got bored and just wanted to be done with this series so she just wrapped it up as quickly as possible.<br /><br />The fact that Gale and her mother just moved away with no words is just ridiculous. I had to think, why did I read this entire series for it to end up like this? I didn't need a Disney style happy ending, I just needed an actual ending, one that provided closure for all the relationships and all the scenarios that began in book one. This wasn't a bad ending, it just wasn't really an ending at all.<br /><br />I'm disappointed because I don't feel like Collins gave it her all with book 3 and finished it as she started it. I want an alternate ending and I hope at least Hollywood will give it to us.
