I so enjoyed the first two books of the Hunger Games trilogy, that I was particularly excited to start the final installment. While many of the battle scenes and Katniss' internal conflicts up to her ultimate realizations were well thought out and written I felt incredibly let down in a couple of the characters' fates. The two that bothered me most were that of Gale and Finnick. Particularly because I would have felt a larger impact from the subsequent climax had Gale died in the sewers in place of Finnick. The more I think of that, the more sense it makes to me. Especially when you come to find out the Gale just "has a fancy job in District 2". That's it? A brush off ending for one of the major characters in the series. Overall an 'ok' read. I liked that she touched on a lot of the characters' in the end, but felt as though fleshing-out the ending another few chapters couldn't have hurt. Just my opinion. I would still recommend the series to any reader.
