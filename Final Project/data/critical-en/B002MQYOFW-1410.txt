"Mockingjay" was what I hoped "Catching Fire" was--the rebel attack on the Capitol.  It's a pretty fast-paced novel, but one that had a somewhat ambiguous ending.  We're left to our own devices to decide the intentions of those in power.<br /><br />I must admit that I get a little agitated at books where war solves a problem, but then muses that war solves nothing.  Um, yes it did.  War is awful, but is sometimes necessary.  I think the world Collins created here in this series justifies the war, but the backtracking is a little frustrating.  Also, why didn't the editor catch the inconsistency in writing numbers.  Sometimes it's District 12, sometimes Twelve.  Team 451, Team Four-Fifty-One.  I know that's anal, but it's not that hard to decide on a format and stick with it.
