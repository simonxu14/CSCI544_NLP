This was a good reading. I personally started reading it because I thought the movie was very scarce on details. This book fills some gaps but still, the events are not really explained. You need to keep reading on the next books.<br /><br />A couple of details that are important on the plot appear here, but were left out in the movie. I recommend it only if you will commit to read the whole trilogy.<br /><br />If you are only reading this one book, go somewhere else.
