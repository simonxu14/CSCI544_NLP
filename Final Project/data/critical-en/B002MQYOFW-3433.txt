The first couple of chapters you get the idea that the people in the capital (capitalists) are rich off of the backs of the workers in the districts. I feel it is very Anti-capitalist and manipulates the minds of the young adults who read it. It is gruesome, portrays Future America ( after the sea rises from climate change) as a dog eat dog society out for excess and willing to get it at the cost of human life. You can tell she develops the spirit of rebellion in the heart of Katniss, against those in the Capital. This may not have been the writers intention, but I fully believe it was, and it is time these people are called out on what they are filling the heads of young people with, let's just call it what it is, shall we? An anti-capitalist propaganda machine. If I could have given it a half a star I would have, the writer deserves only that much..... For effort at least. The idea is genius though, charge young adults to manipulate their minds... I hope any parents that read this review at least think twice about letting their child be exposed to this kind of manipulation. I am glad I read it before letting my child. We will not purchase anymore of this authors books. Kinda feel<br />Iike I have been violated for having purchased this one, total crap.
