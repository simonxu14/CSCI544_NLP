It took considerable effort to read this book, especially in comparison to the first two.  It seemed rushed and countless details were glazed over.  It'll be interesting to see if a movie studio would consider trying to bring this to the big screen, because if they did, they'll have to rewrite half of the screenplay because of the lack of detail.
