This was a good book.  But not a good end to this amazing, inventive trilogy that I invested so much of my heart into.  I was looking forward to this book to see how it all ended, of course, but also to see how Katniss reached maturity and what growth looked like for her.  Much as other reviewers have stated, I didn't get this and found myself extremely disappointed.<br /><br />Even worse, the book is careening towards an end at a swift pace and then the climax falls apart and the ending seems to stumble towards a slapped together conclusion.  I didn't even realize the book was over until I saw the words epilogue.  And not in a good I-was-engrossed- sort of a way.  Rather, it was in a wonder-if-the-publisher-demanded-she-finish-so-she-slammed-an-ending-on kind of way.<br /><br />Again, it was still a fun read but I resent the cheap quality of the ending.
