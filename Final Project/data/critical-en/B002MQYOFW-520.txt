If you would like to read a book in 5 hours that is rife with simplistic sentence structure and a predictable plot, this is for you. It wasn't all bad. I can't help but admire new ideas, even if they aren't all that great, they were at least original. And look at the bright side, if you don't like it, it will be over soon .
