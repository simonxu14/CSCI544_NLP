Interesting premise.  The author has claimed this came about as an odd convergence of "Survivor" and the Iraq war. But this is obviously nothing more than an Americanized "Battle Royale", with what I assume the author believed was more flesh and thought.  However, adding a detailed, moment-by-moment narrative does not do that.  It kept just enough momentum (when I skipped over the drawn out details) to make me finish it.  However, as often as not it worked well to put me asleep on several occasions.<br />Characterizations are inconsistent, the main character fluctuating between around ten and thirty years old in action and attitude. It was somewhat disconcerting and distracting.  Also, there is no real feel for the main character.  Perhaps she is meant to be emotionless, but that carries over to the rest of the book.  During what I assume was to be one of the more emotional scenes, all I could conjure was "OK, lets get on with it...".<br /><br />The dystopian feel is entirely contrived.  While this is oh so obviously intended to make the reader detest the government, I was more disgusted with the thought of parents overtly willing to allow there children to be sent to almost certain death.  This is perhaps good as quick entertainment and a mindless read to spend time.<br /><br />This a served to pull me out of the dystopian/post-apocalyptic genre.  Overall, not a good read.
