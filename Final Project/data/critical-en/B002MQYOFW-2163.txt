I had read that this series equated to Harry Potter or Twilight therefore I was interested.  While this series was good, I would not have equated to the other two series.  The plot was unique and contained interesting twists.  However, it was not a "I can't put this down - stay up past my bedtime to read' series. I would recommend the series to others - but found it to definitely be a 'young adult' series.
