I liked the first two books a lot, but this one just didn't really do it for me.  I couldn't seem to wrap my head around the underground society, and I found the ending to be pretty anticlimactic.  It's like, after all that, this dystopic, quasi-fairytaile ending is how it ends up for her?  Meh.  Stop reading after the first two.
