The Hunger Games is a riveting, but disturbing book. As I read the book, my emotions vascillated between thinking the book was too far-fetched, (really.... kids killing kids on reality t.v???) to feeling horrified about the idea of sacrificing children for the sins of the adults. (Where's Theseus when we need him?)<br />Although Katniss and Peeta show examples of courage, love, and self-sacrifice throughout the story, I'm bothered that the author doesn't go into deeper detail about how these godly, spiritual traits were developed in these kids. Where does one learn to love one's neighbor as oneself?<br /><br />The book has a flavor of a futuristic "Theseus and the Minotaur", "The Truman Show", and "Twilight" all combined into one story. It's an attention getter, and certainly will make you think! A word of caution -  I believe the book might be too disturbing for sensitive teenagers.
