I liked the hunger games trilogy. I thought it might have gone a different way for the ending. However an apt ending which tidied up all the loose strings. I was hoping the end may have been a bit more about the after effects of the great battle. Instead it took up the whole story. I would have liked to see how well 13 moved on and who Catniss became after the fall of the Capitol. Still kept up the interest.
