Not a terribly uplifting end to the trilogy.  The pace dragged in places, and most of the end was surprisingly predictable.  It appears the author had written herself into a box she could only escape by bludgeoning her (and her protagonist's) way out.  Many of the most interesting characters either die or disappear from the storyline, with no idea what happened to them; many of the others settle into a dull repetition which makes you wish they had met a similar fate.  If you've read the other two books, certainly read this one to complete the story - if not, skip it, as it really can't stand on it's own.
