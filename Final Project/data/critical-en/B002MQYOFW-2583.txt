Loved the first two... wish I'd stopped there. So depressing. I read to escape; if I wanted this kind of story, I just have to turn on the news. The author turned beloved characters into depressed, suicidal, weak, losers. And the killings! She made us love these characters and then killed them off, with nothing to show for it. I kept turning the pages...expecting the story to turn around...and nothing. To top it all off, there's no real climax. It's just FLAT, all the way through. And where's the love story? Katniss would never have left Peeta to be tortured for so long. She would have saved him with her life. And the ending...really? Boring. I'm so disappointed. I would never recommend this book. If they make a third movie, I hope they make it completely different.
