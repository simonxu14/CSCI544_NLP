I LOVED the Hunger Games.  I hated Mockingjay.  I felt the Author became tired and just wanted to finish up the series.  The ending was horrible and depressing.  I do not need a fairy tale finish but geez leave your readers with some sense of satisfaction for purchasing and reading all of your books. Peeta and Katniss do not even seem like they want to be together in the end.  Now Katniss has to worry if Petta is gonna knock her off while she is sleeping at night.  Thanks for nothing Collins.
