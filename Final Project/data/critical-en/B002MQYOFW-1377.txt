Everyone else loves this book.  Perhaps because it means different things to different people.  What the point of the book is can be debated.  What can't be debated is what we need to go through to get to the point.  At one key moment in the book (and here is the spoiler) a twelve year old girl is captured in netting, tortured (until she calls the name of her friend), and then upon the appearance of her friend she is killed by having a spear driven through her stomach.  The person who kills her is a 14 year old boy.  Upon her friend seeing her killed she shoots an arrow through the neck of the boy.  The girl shooting the arrow is 16.<br /><br />The book is well written, if not a bit predictable.  The question I had while reading the book is why was it written?  It lacks the subtlety of Lord of the Flies and ultimately delivers a much less powerful message or warning.  Basically, we have a story that uses the theme of kids being forced to kill kids to advance the plot.  Not my cup of tea.  And it may not be your cup of tea too if you are in the minority like me.
