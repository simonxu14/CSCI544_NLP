I thought the first third of this book was very good.  Collins did an excellent job creating a very likable and strong heroine in Katniss.  However, the whole idea of kids killing kids was lost on me.  Our children are inundated with so much violence and gore, that it would be nice to have seen this novel avoid the violence.  Granted, Collins avoided the extreme graphic detail that one associates with adult novels, but I would not recommend this to any reader under the age of 14 or 15.
