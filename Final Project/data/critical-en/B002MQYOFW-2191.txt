I'm a retired middle school teacher and still enjoy keeping up with young adult fiction. After reading The Hunger Games, I couldn't wait to read the sequels.  All three books are well written, and, I have to add, very well edited. (Too many books today, even ones from NY publishing houses, miss grammar errors and word misusage in the narrative.) Character development had excellent consistency; plot detail was in the realm of JK Rowling's creativity.  I appreciated that Collins used very little graphic violence in the Arena in the first book, and human compassion triumphed. The middle book was darker and more violent. The final book disappointed me because it was all about violence and the deaths of thousands of innocent people. The wrong people die.  Yes, war is like that, but the author was in control of this war.  The positive themes of love, loyalty, and compassion did not come through strongly enough.  Mockingjay was not as enjoyable or uplifting as the first book.
