Having heard so much about these books from my kids I decided to read them myself.  I enjoyed the Hunger Games and Catching Fire but found this, the final book a let down.  It seemed to me that the book struggled to capture the magnitude of the epic battle that was to resolve the story.  Instead, everything felt a bit undersized and underscoped.  Unlike the first two books, I needed to force myself to finish the Mockingjay.  I didn't feel the engagement with the story I had previously felt.
