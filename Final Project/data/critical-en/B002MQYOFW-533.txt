I liked this book and it was a nice closing of the story. However, I didn't feel it was as strong as the first 2 books in the series. Sure, there is plenty of action and emotion and death. But it just seemed that &#34;something&#34; was missing from this one as opposed to the first 2 books. The ending was a decent finish to the story but perhaps a bit anticlimactic. Despite that, I would still recommend this book.
