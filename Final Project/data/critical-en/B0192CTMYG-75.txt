Only received part 2 of the whole book, the product WAS NOT what I ordered as titled. It says it's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Korean Edition) not Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Korean Edition) Part II, like it SHOULD say.<br /><br />Needless to say I am super disappointed with what I received. Now I need to look for volume I of the first book.
