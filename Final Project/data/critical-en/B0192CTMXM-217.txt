biggest complaint - the picture you see of this book, the picture you look at when deciding to purchase this item is the BLUE American release of HP5. The book that arrived was the BRITISH version, which I won't go into the details on how the versions are different. Do the research.<br /><br />I don't remember seeing anywhere in the description of what I purchased, THIS IS THE BRITISH RELEASE.  I now have a complete set on HP books, with one random odd- ball.
