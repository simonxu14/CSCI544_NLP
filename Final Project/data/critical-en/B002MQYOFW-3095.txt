I ordered this because it had narration with it and I was about to take a long road trip.  What I didn't know was that the narration only lasts for the first ten minutes of the book - not even through the first chapter.  Then, you have to pay more to have the rest of the narration.  I was away from wi-fi by the time I discovered that, so I was not able to listen to this series while on the road as I had intended.  I haven't read the book yet, so perhaps my rating would have been better, but my experience with this purchase was only disappointing.
