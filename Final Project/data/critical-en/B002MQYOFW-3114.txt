I saw the movie, "The Hunger Games," about two weeks ago.  I just finished the third book last night.<br /><br />I drove home from the theater and immediately downloaded the books (on sale, even!) and read them on my iPhone with every minute I could spare.  I was hooked.  I was enthralled.  I could NOT STOP reading.  I'm mainly a writer, and partly an analyst of books - not exactly your typical avid reader - so my being absolutely gripped by these books was quite a surprise for me.  These last two weeks, I've been recommending The Hunger Games to everyone I know.<br /><br />The books obviously play on some very popular themes (strong female protagonist, a young person coming of age, romantic love triangle, post-apocalyptic survival, the issue of slavery), however...  Collins' treatment of these familiarities expertly infuses a delicious blend of flavors to set her story apart, such as politics, ethics, and core humanity values.  You read the books in first person, from Katniss' perspective, hearing the complex thoughts and feeling the confusing emotions that this very memorable teenage character endures as she faces an endless onslaught of threats and challenges.  Collins does a remarkable job of sinking her teeth into you and forcing you to keep turning the pages.<br /><br />The first book so powerfully transports you into Katniss' struggles, you can't help but be hungry when she's starving, and hurt when she's injured.  We learn to love and value Katniss for the way she braves the dangers, unpredictably prevails against the odds, and outsmarts the competition.  THIS is a great book, and a great beginning to an epic tale.<br /><br />The second book is every bit as powerful as the first, but it covers so much more than just the games.  It deepens the plots, it raises the stakes, it opens your eyes to her entire world and a unique cast of characters.  This buildup toward the climax of all the main plots is positively legendary!  It's stunning, breathtaking, exciting!  Catching Fire might be one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read.<br /><br />The third book you read because you MUST KNOW what happens!  However... it's absolutely, totally, completely... DISAPPOINTING!  Allow me to elaborate:<br /><br />Katniss vs. Herself: Collins continues to put Katniss in mercilessly difficult positions.  In the first two books, she outsmarts, shines through, and somehow puts her best foot forward while stuck between a rock and a hard place, painting pictures of realistic human qualities that inspire us to be true to ourselves.  But, in the third book, Katniss is nothing short of an irrevocable train wreck, a whining schizophrenic juvenile, and a total and utter failure THE ENTIRE TIME.  (Although a nice little epilogue tells you she turns out okay.)  It was a horribly lacking deterioration of potentially dazzling character development.<br /><br />Gale vs. Peeta: Collins does an amazing job of pitting Katniss' two love interests against each other.  In the first two books, we explore their similarities and differences, their passions and talents, and feel Katniss' confusion because we love them both for different reasons along with her.  But, in the third book, Collins' neglect of this subject leaves you feeling like Katniss never even makes a choice; instead of seizing her own destiny with one or the other with her courageous confrontational skills, she instead lets herself fall victim to circumstance and leaves her fate in the hands of happenstance, mundane details.  It was a flatly impotent conclusion to a potentially sizzling romance.<br /><br />The Rebels vs. the Capitol: Collins delivers us into a very believable extension of history, creating a fantastic story around the vicious cycle of humans enslaving one another to seek recompense from their former enemies' children.  The first two books debate this issue from a multitude of perspectives, infusing objectivity and a sense of higher reasoning into the conversation, as you watch the characters play out their parts on every side of the issue.  But the third book calls a conclusion to this argument that leaves you feeling hopeless for humanity, confused instead of clear, and utterly shocked at the way everyone breaks character and fails to make better choices or act more productively.  It was a disappointing vote to abstain on a real issue ripe with compelling potential.<br /><br />I wasn't hoping this would be another predictable fairytale of a novel.  I was only hoping for Collins to finish what she'd started; to give me the same sense of enjoyment in reading this third book as with the first two; to let her characters grow and flourish instead of falter and wilt; to make her story a model argument why we shouldn't hate the offspring of those who've wronged us... This book did N-O-N-E of these things!!!  It's an atrocious, bitter end to a story I was head-over-heels in love with.  WHAT HAPPENED?  Did Collins slip into a coma just to have her publisher subcontract some lesser author who'd never read the first two books?!?  I keep wishing Collins would rewrite this concluding book and republish, saying, "Sorry! Just Kidding!"  Oh well, maybe the movie will depart completely from the book and stand some slight chance of reconciliation.<br /><br />Ultimately, if you've read book two, you'll probably buy this regardless of the reviews.  So, prepare for disappointment of epic proportions.
