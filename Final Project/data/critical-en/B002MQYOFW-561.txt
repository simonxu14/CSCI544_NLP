I was really disappointed. It is not that I didn't agree with the story line - I am an adult, I can live with the fact that the story didn't &#34;go where I wanted it to&#34;. I thought the writing of this novel was subpar and I thought the character development absolutely fell apart. Whereas I recommend the first two books, I don't recommend this one at all.
