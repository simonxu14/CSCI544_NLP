*Contains spoilers*  It took me a while to figure out my main problem with this book. I think that I am mostly bothered because I ended up having an intense dislike for Katniss.  She has no redeeming qualities in this 3rd book; selfish, cruel, and spends most of the book in some sort of mental breakdown.  She never achieves the potential that was always hinted at and the relationships between her and the "people she cares about" just seem really false.  I kept waiting for conversation scenes and relationship development (not necessarily romance development), but they never came.  Just scenes and scenes of propaganda filming, huddling in closets, analyzing pod traps, etc.  And Katniss voting to continue the hunger games?  That was irredeemable in the face of how in the beginning how she was so protective of children in the first books and now is apparently just as cruel and vengeful as the Capitol people.  What, now instead of protecting people (like Prim, Roe, the poor sick and injured people in the hospital in district 8) she is going to watch children kill each other and be tortured in the arena for revenge?  They destroy the only "good" characters (either by torture or death; cue Peeta and Finnick) and leave me with a sour taste in my mouth, preaching about how awful war is (and yes, that's true, but does the author think we are all so stupid that we can't figure out that fact without driving it home over and over again?)  Gale's character and actions are frequently attacked without giving a fair and opposing viewpoint.  So unsatisfying.  The first book that I have actually deleted from my Kindle.
