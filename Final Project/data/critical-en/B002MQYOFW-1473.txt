I think this book could have been better. I thought the first two books in the series were written very well and expected the best for last, but it missed my expectations. It seemed to have a lot of "filler" parts in it, so when I finished the book it made me wonder "what was the point". I think Susanne Collins is a great writer, but I wonder if she just didn't have it in her to write this last book or was pressured to finish it to soon.
