I read this book because my son was required to read it during this summer before 10th grade, and I was curious.  I found it interesting and compelling enough to finish it, but ultimately by the end I was not impressed at all.  There are several reasons:<br />1.  There were way too many totally arbitrary plot twists, i.e. things that were thrown in just to make the story work.  Examples of this include several sudden changes in the rules of the game, and most of all, the strange reincarnated werewolf-like creatures that showed up toward the end.  That was totally ridiculous, but there were other examples I won't mention.  Much of the plot just seemed jury-rigged to me.<br />2.  The character development was somewhat weak.  By the end I only had a vague idea of who Katniss was, and I found Peeta even more mysterious.<br />3.  I could have used a little more description of the territory used for the arena.  I didn't have a good sense of how big it was or how it was laid out.  That made some of the movements of the contestants hard for me to follow geographically.<br /><br />But beyond all that, I am surprised and a little appalled that my son's school would require THIS book for summer reading.  I mean, this is basically cheap pulp fiction about a bunch of kids killing each other in some completely made-up unrealistic futuristic setting.  We're not likely to face this sort of environment any time soon in America, and there is nothing useful for a 10th grader to learn from this book.  What is the school trying to accomplish?<br /><br />I don't agree with the one-star reviewer who labeled all the positive reviewers as dense or cruel.  I think that's mean-spirited.  It's only fiction after all, it didn't really happen, and I would not expect an average teenager to be materially affected by it one way or the other.  If you think it's a cool, fun read, fine, there is nothing wrong with you.  Lots of kids enjoy reading low-grade pulp fiction - it's better than reading nothing at all.  Accordingly, though I would be sorely tempted to just tell my son how the story goes, I probably will not do that.
