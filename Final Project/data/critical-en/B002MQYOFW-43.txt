This, the third and final installment of The Hunger Games, was a drag. I managed to finish the story because I'm familiar with the characters and it was a pretty quick read, but the unholy amount of negative introspection and relating of dreams made the whole story just plod along like a wounded bear. What irks me most is that I could have been reading anything else and it would likely have been better.
