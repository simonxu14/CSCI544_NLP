It's really pretty, but I am not sure it is worth the full price. The artwork is gorgeous beyond gorgeous, but I feel it takes away from the imaginative part of the story because you don't have to take the time to create your own world anymore. Also, the book is quite large and heavy, so just be prepared for that.<br /><br />I have a hard time saying anything remotely negative about a HP product, but my feelings on this really are mixed. I don't regret my purchase at all, but I think it would have hindered my love of the series if I had read this version first.
