Enjoyed the first 2 of the series. Even enjoyed the movie sort of. However (spoiler alert) the third book killing of characters that I connected with needlessly; and the never-endng &#34;mental illnesses&#34; of the remaining characters was a complete and total disappointment. It seemed like the author was searching for a way out, and chose a pathetic and mind numbing path. I should have been warned and just quit after the second book.<br /><br />I hope they don't continue with plans for a movie sequel, I will avoid it purposefully.
