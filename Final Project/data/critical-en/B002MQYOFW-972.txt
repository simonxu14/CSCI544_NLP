Annoyingly, the &#34;Kindle Edition with Audio/Video&#34; doesn't work with Amazon cloud reader. I suppose I should have bought the other slightly cheaper Kindle edition; perhaps that would have worked.<br /><br />After borrowing my wife's Kindle, I have no complaints about the content of the book so far, but have only just started reading it.
