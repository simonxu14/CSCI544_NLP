The full page illustrations are spectacular. The problem is the full text pages. In book #1, many of the text pages had small drawings or drops of ink. There is far less of that in this book. Moreover, the text pages have a shaded pattern that repeats exactly for many pages. Plain white would have been a better choice. This is an obvious cheap compromise.<br /><br />I hope they do a better job with the next books.
