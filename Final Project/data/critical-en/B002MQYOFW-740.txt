As with the other Hunger Games books, Collins has a decent storyline that is presented at the reading level of an 8th grader. The foreshadowing is overplayed, and frankly there's almost no suspense out of the fact that you already know Katniss is basically immortal. In general the character development is weak, but I guess that's just what to be expected these days.<br /><br />I actually did like the ending quite a bit more than people give it credit for. But with that said the delivery to it was terrible. I don't mean it was boring (though parts of it were), I just mean it was very poorly written.<br /><br />If Collins were smart, she would take a page out of Rowling's books. If you go back to the HP series, you'll notice that nearly the entire book is actually interesting plot development. The Voldemort scenes in the first 2 books are actually only a chapter long - and that's a formula for keeping your reader up until 3 am to finish the book. Again the story is neat, just poorly delivered. Those middle 300 pages aren't just there to run up the publisher's costs.
