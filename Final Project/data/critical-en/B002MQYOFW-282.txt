Definitely written for the younger crowd which guarantees a media giant's smash hit. I didn't care for the images of attractive young people brutalizing each other for food. I wish the author had spent more time defining the root causes of the planet's societal decay. I think she chose not to because the target reader quickly bores with such things given their limited attention span. The author is a good writer and I can't fault her for snatching the gold ring. Great book/movie for kids, although I'd be careful with children getting hold of it. I prefer something with adult intellect, eg., 1984 or Fruit of the Gods.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/1984/dp/B003JTHWKU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">1984</a><a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Fruit-of-the-Gods/dp/B00DQUWUJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fruit of the Gods</a>
