The 3 stars is not for the context in the book.  But the quality of the book.  Upon the receiving the book (hard cover), the top had been damaged and smashed.  The cover itself looked like someone had taken a knife (or other sharp object) and attempted to cut the back cover multiple times.  I am very disappointed in the quality this book is in compared to others I have bought.
