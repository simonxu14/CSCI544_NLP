This book was something of a disappointment, because it took me to places that I really didn't want to go. I grew up reading books about the Holocaust, World War II etc. As an adult I am so &#34;over&#34; the subject of war, suffering and mass slaughter.<br /><br />The first book showed Katniss' resourcefulness and compassion during the Games, making her an appealing character. But by the third book, Katniss' only function is to provide a 'symbol' for the revolution. She is mostly a passive participant who sits around suffering in excruciating detail. More than I really wanted to read.<br /><br />I'm sure it's possible to write a war/revolution novel without focusing on the blood & gore. Show us some other things: a little more depth about the other districts, a few more clever strategies that didn't rely on slaughter, maybe even some scenes with Capitol residents who sympathize with the rebels. Maybe even a little humor to lighten things up!<br /><br />I found it irritating that the author kept pulling the same strings; overusing the love-triangle plot, televising the revolution and having a 'prep team' that makes Katniss look beautiful even while she's an emotional wreck. This is the problem with a trilogy: authors either have to keep recycling plot points, or come up with something even more outrageous. This is one reason that I, as a writer, am sick of all these trilogies. It really does become a soap opera. Come to think of it, Books 2 and 3 of this series might have worked better as a single book.<br /><br />SPOILER SPOILER,<br /><br />I kept trying to guess how this would end. I thought Katniss would be hunting President Snow through the Arena. With Plutarch filming it, of course. It would have been such a logical development, since the Arena was such an important part of the other books,  that I'm a bit disappointed that it didn't happen that way.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm sure that the film makers will just love doing this film because it has what they love the most: lots of explosions, gore and horror.
