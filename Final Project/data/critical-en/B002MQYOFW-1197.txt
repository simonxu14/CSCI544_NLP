I'm giving it two stars simply because I enjoyed the other two books so much, but to be perfectly honest, I wanted to give it less; while I practically worshiped the first two books and would have given them ten stars if I could have, this last installment to the book brought down my opinion of the entire series. Instead of the empowered feeling of survival and triumph that I have felt while reading the previous two books, I ended this one feeling absolutely depressed and in a vague sense of shock like, "Did she really do that? Did this really happen? Is this REALLY the end?"<br /><br />And it was.<br /><br />The END.<br /><br />From the very beginning, I had a bad feeling about this one, but I figured since I loved the first two so much, I had to know how it all ended. I figured, like the other books, it would somehow pull through for a fantastic ending that I would be very pleased with, like the other two did.<br /><br />Instead, Katniss--a character I've loved--seems to jump back and forth from being wilted to being needlessly sensitive about certain things you would think she would be hardened to by now. The love story, which I have enjoyed and even felt was necessary due to the plot, stops being enjoyable and becomes unpleasant to read, putting it mildly. (I've always grimaced a little when people say this is like Twilight, because there is SO MUCH more substance to these books, but Katniss/Peeta/Gale did begin to channel Bella/Edward/Jacob a few times in this book....) Katniss seems to want only the guy she can't have, and seems only to attribute credit to some people while leaving out others who move mountains for her and put their life at risk for her. Also, her, "I owe [insert name here] so much now!" begins to get a little redundant.<br /><br />I had hope about midway through this book, but my hopes were dashed as the depressing ending fell out onto the pages. There is a lot of action, a LOT of violence (all fine, since it obviously fits with the story) but then at the climax of the end, it's abruptly stopped and you're told what happened in summary. Understandable, but it is preceded by a weird dream and I felt a little disoriented at first as I tried to figure out if what I was reading was real of Kat's dream world. Then, since they have to tie up a certain loose end, a fairly weak and not-exactly-heartfelt-explanation is given for why the ending is what it is.<br /><br />All in all, a very disappointing end to a really great series.<br />It honestly makes me sad to give it such a critical, dissatisfied review.<br />:(
