I bought only because the first two 'books had no real ending so you had to keep going. The first was okay but the second was terrible as well from a writing quality standpoint.  It was not just rudimentary or young. It was awful.  The end was a lame attempt at trying not to sell out but selling out in the epilogue.  Just terrible!
