The third and final installment the highly acclaimed Hunger Games ended on a low note for me. I recently finished the book and felt uneasy about it as a whole. I am a huge fan of the first two, but something about this one bothered me.<br /><br />I felt that Katniss' character seemed dull and I personally could not stand her in Mockingjay. I realize shes in her crazy state but its her charm and true voice that drove the series.<br /><br />What I thought to be a major fault in this novel was that it seemed like a rough draft. Collins would gloss over important events, merely telling rather than showing. Also, she would go on a Katniss-inner-conversation rant that took up pages and pages. I literally skipped these parts. Give me the meat, Collins!<br /><br />I was also quite shocked that there was absolutely no purpose to some of the deaths. Finnick's, for example, was highly unnecessary. Not only did it not affect the plot but when he died, there was barely any talk of him afterwards. For such a main character, he should at least received a few paragraphs of mourning's from the other characters. Its like killing off Harry Potter and never mentioning him after it!<br /><br />I'm quite fine with the whole not-a-perfect-ending thing. I just wished it would have been more thought out as it being the conclusion of it all.<br /><br />Overall, it felt unfinished, rushed, and ,as a fan, I felt displeased.
