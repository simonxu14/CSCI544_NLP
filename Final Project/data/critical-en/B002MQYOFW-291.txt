I labored over these three books. I loved  every moment until the last few chapters. Come on! Is this suppose to be a book for young people? What was the point? The ending left me disappointed and sad. I spent all this time reading these books only to be left disappointed and feeling broken. If this was a triolgy for any age, the ending was a disappointment.<br /><br />My Victor was left a broken mess, not the person I expected to come out of all this reading, a sad broken person as all the characters turned out to be. Couldn't this author give us one winner out of all this. She doesn't even leave us anything much to know about Gail.<br /><br />I have enough disappointment to hear or know about in one day, I read for comfort, freedom and a happy spirit and soul, not what the ending gave me.<br /><br />Suzanne's ending of this last book seemed to me that she was tired of the story, her characters and gave no thought to the ending except to stamp it as ordinary!
