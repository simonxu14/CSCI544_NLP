Truth be told, I am not a big fiction reader, but I am a lover of good stories, as most people are, and this is not one of them. Sigh.<br />The way this "war" was written was so calculated and methodical and even dull. When they talked about propos, I  like I was watching the filming of a lame TV show. Not realistic. At all.<br />I devoured the first two books on the edge of my seat in a matter of days. With this one, I begrudgingly finished it in a few weeks. Katniss' character lost her "fire" and spirit that her fans fell in love with in the first two books as she descended into a depressed megalomaniac. The action scenes were not moving in the least. At times they were confusing and sloppy. I didnt realize some of her people had even died until she referred back to it later in the book--Finnick and then Prim. The ending was also not at all what I expected. I thought the face off between Katniss and Snow would be a little more dramatic. Peeta lost his allure with his memory implants. everything that was awesome about the first two was watered down, merky or degraded in the third book. Basically, I just wish it could be totally rewritten. I think if they are going to make a movie, something will have to be done to make this watchable. HBO could flip this thing like they did with True Blood and it could be great.
