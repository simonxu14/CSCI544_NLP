I downloaded the Hunger Games, without knowing anything about it other than it was being made into a film with the wonderful young actress Jennifer Lawrence. I'm a 61-year-old man. This is a book for teenage girls who can imagine themselves as Katniss Everdeen, the heroine of the book - evolving, active, unsure of her feelings but secure in her abilities, kind, just, and finding love. The story is relatively simple: after a rebellion, 12 surviving districts must pay tribute to the Capitol by sending two of its children to fight to the death as a sign of submission to the state. Only one would survive and reap the riches of survival. Katniss, 16, takes the place of her 12-year-old sister, who'd been chosen by lottery (thank you Shirley Jackson). From the very beginning there is no question that Katniss will survive; the only suspense is manufactured danger and process: will Katriss be able to kill her competitors (only in righteous justice), will she be injured (slightly, and not permanently scarred; and will she fall in love with her district partner. For me, there was only one surprise, and that was the origin of the dogs that attack in the action climax.<br /><br />The book ends with an eye toward a sequal. Teenage girls are probably in thrall at the prospect. I'll pass.
