I'm a grandmother, but I just LOVED the first 'young adult' book, The Hunger Games.  I liked the second book, Catching Fire, a lot.  Mockingjay, however, was just okay.  After reading more than half the book, I just wanted to know how it ended, skipped to the end, and was glad I was finished reading it.
