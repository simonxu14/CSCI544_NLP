Okay so two days after buying the Hunger Games I am finished with the book. Read it all the way to the end and now I have to say something about it. I bought the book because I wanted to see what all of the fuss was about. Well, I am not exactly sure why people are gushing over this. Then I remember that this book is primarily aimed at young teenage girls. I'm not a young teenage girl. At least I don't think so. This isn't the first time that I have read a YA novel with a female heroine. I read both Garth Nix's "Abhorsen" series along with Phillip Pullman's "His Dark Materials" and loved them.<br /><br />It's been about an hour since I finished the book and I want to write something while the story is fresh in my mind. I am trying to pin down what exactly was missing from the book. It didn't give me that "wow" factor that makes me want to know more, to read the next book, to see what happens next. In fact, I am pretty sure that I am going to stop right here with this series. Overall it was a decent book but it was nothing spectacular. It was a page-turner for sure, but more because I wanted to get to the end as fast as possible. And the end left me wanting. But it didn't leave me wanting more, just something else, something better.
