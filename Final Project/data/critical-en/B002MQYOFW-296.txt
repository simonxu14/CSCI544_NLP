I don't want to spoil, so I will be brief. Of the 3 books, this is the one I don't like. For me, it was extremely sad, dramatic, bloody and brutal. The brutal and bloody aspect of the book is not what I dislike about the book, but 3 sad events in the book in particular that I wish had not occurred. However, the very end was not very sad and the happy epilogue consoles me.
