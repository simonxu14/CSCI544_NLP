I really loved the first book and felt okay with the second book. In fact I liked the first book much more than the movie because it explained a lot of things that were kind of confusing. I think that it is well written grammatically and it had wonderful word choice, but I just couldn't finish this series.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />-------------Don't Read this Because it Might Be Spoiler------------------------<br /><br /> I will say I didn't like it, but I understood when a lot of main characters started dying because hey there is a war happening in this book and people die, so get over it. The characters were all done pretty well....except for the main character. She seemed to be constantly be the exception to the rules of morality to prove how superior she was. She became increasingly irritating because of this fact. Everyone else was wonderful, but the main character.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />This book might just not have been for me, so I won't knock anyone for trying it.
