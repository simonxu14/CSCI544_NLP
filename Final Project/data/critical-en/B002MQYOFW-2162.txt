I got involved into the series after watching the movie and hoping the book was better due to some obvious shortcomings in the movie. After reading book 1 i felt the book was indeed better yet still a disappointment. The plot is interesting when initially set , but as the books advance its a downhill overuse of cliffhangers, predictable writing, and an attempt to create too much  empathy with the main character ended up ruining the series for me.<br /><br />This is still an interesting read, but i had heard good things from these and expected more. so i am reviewing these on high standards. Took about a week to read the full series, easy to read, recommended for teens and under.
