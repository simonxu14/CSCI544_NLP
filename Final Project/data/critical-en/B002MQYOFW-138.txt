One of my only reviews I've ever put on here, but this book is nothing more than entertaining escape fiction.  Is it dystopian?  Sure.  But comparing this to 1984, Brave New World, or Fahrenheit 451 is an insult.  There is simply no legitimate description of WHY the world in this novel exists outside of a few boilerplate pages.  Not to mention, once the game starts (half way through or so) the author drops any real attempt to parallel the dystopia with current society -- in other words, it's just an action novel.<br /><br />The characters were flat with the exception of the heroine, and the author's attempt at creating even a faux love for survival were lame.  I would compare this to the first Harry Potter novel, but it at least created an alternative world with consistency and detail.  The Hunger Games is more-or-less 6th grade action fiction with enough violence and innuendo to make it to Hollywood.  Sadly, I expect the movie to be better than the book.
