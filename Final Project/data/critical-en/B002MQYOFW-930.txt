I saw the first two movies and bought this book because I didn't want to wait to find out what happens. This final book in the series starts of strong, and has some interesting plot twists. However, it really lost momentum as it went on. It almost felt as if the writer didn't know how to end it. That being said, I did enjoy the hunger games trilogy and look forward to the Mockingjay movies. Overall, I think this writer did an excellent job of painting a dystopian picture with elements relatable to our society today. It's not just a story of an unlikely hero, but it's a warning of what can happen when the wrong people come to power.
