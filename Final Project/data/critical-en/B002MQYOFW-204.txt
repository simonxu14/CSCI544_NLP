Once the story picked up, about a third of the way through, there was suspense aplenty to keep me turning page after page because I just had to know what would happen next and  how everything would turn out.<br /><br />However..... I kept waiting and waiting for some interaction between Katniss and Peeta or Katniss and Haymitch to appear. Or even Gale for that matter, who had a much larger role in the Mockingjay but even with a large appearance on Gale's part I got little insight into him as a person, who he is, or what makes him tick.  Peeta and Haymitch  took on the appearance of placeholders waiting for the real characters I once loved to appear.<br /><br />The climax of  all the action turned into a  "been there done that"  on a much larger scale.<br /><br />Mockingjay never recaptured the original relationships that enthralled me form the very beginning of the trilogy...with the exception of Prim, Katniss's little sis, who we get to see a little more clearly. I warmed up to a couple of the new characters in this book but the only attachments I have with the main characters are harbored feeling from the previous two books.<br /><br />There was so much potential for the personal relationships to get revved back up again but every time a spark flared it was quickly smothered with more planning, fighting, and casualties. When Peeta finally shows up I start thinking Alright here we go!... but no.... Katniss and Peeta have minimal interaction through out the entire book. The big question of who Katniss will choose, Gale or Peeta?, And how will in come about?, was dragged out through the pages of this book without much light on the subject until the very end. I got the impression that Collins was trying to convince me how little it mattered who Katniss choose and why.<br />In the end I felt like I'd been hoodwinked. It reminded of a timeshare sales pitch where they lure you in with nice words like shiny new car or big screen TV... just to find out that all they want to do is sell you a condo you can use one week out of the year.<br /><br />I love the first two books and I will try to keep them in good memory. Although Mockingjay had some of the page turning qualities of its predecessors, it just doesn't compare to the first two Hunger Games that left me hungry for more.
