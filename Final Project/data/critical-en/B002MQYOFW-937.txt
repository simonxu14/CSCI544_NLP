I honestly regret ever reading this novel. After the very inspiring end to Catching Fire, I looked forward to reading this. However, I found it only to be depressing and frustrating as the leaders of the Districts' rebellion seem to mimic Madam Defarges descent into darkness in A Tale of Two Cities and become just as brutal as President Snow. The story-telling is suspenseful and intriguing, but makes you progressively sadder until it wraps up in one of the most unsatisfying endings I've witnessed, especially considering the merit of its two predecessors.
