When I first read this series I was like wow what a great book. But now I say the last two books were not bad but ok. I was epecting more from Collins but I was let down. The second book was a mess. The third book was a disaster. The plot of the story was drawn out and confusing. It was like a first grade story that was drawn out. Even though I didn't like Catching fire i still read Mockingjay because I wanted to know how the series ends, also Collins does the wrong thing at the end. She makes Catniss kill snow the she kills Coin. Whats up with that. I thought Coin was the good guy. Anyway i though Mockingjay was a bad way to end the series off. I mean the book wasn't even engaging. The first book was awesone and engaging. This book nor Catching fire had it. So I think the Hunger games series was ok because of the second and third book.
