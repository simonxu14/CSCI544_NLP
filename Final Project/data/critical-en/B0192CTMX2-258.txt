In general, I've found that buying used audio-books is better than borrowing them from a libraray.  In general, used CDs have rarely been played more than a few times.  My experience with Daily Deals was different.  They had the audacity to sell an audio-book that had clearly been used by a lending library.  Although not clearly visible, every disc had defects that caused it to skip.  We missed extensive passages due to the skipping.  It was a most disappointing and unpleaseant experience.
