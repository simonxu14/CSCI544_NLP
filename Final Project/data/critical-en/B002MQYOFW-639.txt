I can't help but feel disappointed in this ending book. It takes you through Katniss' end and what happens to the victors who were not taken away with Katniss, but rather by the capitol. It then takes you through all the mental breakdowns, makes you suspicious of what you had previously hoped would be the salvation to all the problems in this series, and make you wonder when something good will happen.<br /><br />This last book took me the longest to complete, simply because I felt it dragged on at times (of course, I tend to like books more filled with action, versus drama). However, the ending was satisfying and what I would have liked to see. If you've gotten this far in the series, don't stop now!
