I love these books. I read them on my Kindle, and I wanted the physical books because I loved them so much, and I wanted to be able to re-read them and have my husband read them. So my review is NOT about the writing or the story, but rather on the quality of craftsmanship of this set.<br /><br />The text is huge, and very child-like (on a positive note, good for someone with vision problems). I know these are &#34;young adult&#34; books, but the text felt more like what I'd expect in a book for elementary school readers, not high school readers.<br /><br />They're also not very well constructed. Opening the first book I felt like it will easily fall apart. Unfortunately, none of this is obvious just by looking at them in the box. They look dramatic and like they will be fine. It's only when you unwrap the plastic, and take out the books that it becomes obvious they are shoddily made.<br /><br />I say look for a different set if you want to own the books. Or buy them individually. I wish I had.
