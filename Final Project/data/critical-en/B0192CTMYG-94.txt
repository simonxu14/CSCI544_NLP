The main thing I was up set about was how the seller mailed the product to me.  It should have been put in a box instead they put it in a manila envelope and by the time it reached me it was smashed.  I have every book on cd and the box is as much of the product as the disc.  I had to us packing tape to somewhat put the box back together.
