I have to say I read the first book and was thoroughly impressed. The suspense was breathtakingly well played out, it was gripping, nail biting, action packed drama. This series is by no means for the faint at heart.<br /><br />The idea that the world had fallen into decay, that barbaric games are played to control the communities, in general the direction of the books , is astounding. I find it a tale that can be paralleled on so many level to our own reality.<br /><br />However it's becomes apparent that Katniss is about as much of a heroine someone who walks down the street and watches an old lady get mugged and looks away. She is a sniveling, sooking irritation well and truly before the end of the second book.<br /><br />I was so disappointed throughout book 3- the story slowed right down. The action happened when Katniss was ALWAYS knocked out. So it could be explained easier, later.<br /><br />I found the live triangle to be a complete flop. Being the heroine in the story, I felt her "happy ending" was merely a woman just settling with what she got.<br /><br />I was disappointed greatly.
