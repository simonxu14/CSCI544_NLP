Amazon lists The Hunger Games for grade 7 and up.  What exactly in this book is appropriate for seventh graders?  Teenagers killing each other?  The reading level is adult, the theme is revolting.  We do care about the main characters it's true.  Guess it's a sign of the times that Amazon considers this appropriate for young people, and that so many thousands give it a high rating.  Perhaps they are all 7th graders or at least have a 7th grade mentality.
