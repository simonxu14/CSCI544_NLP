I read the entire series because my wife likes to talk about books she reads and she encouraged me to read them.  However, it seemed that the story line jumped all over the place and it ended very abruptly.  It was an ok read but, far from the best I've read.  If you haven't already read them, I'd suggest the Harry Potter books.  I'm also reading Eragon, at the moment and it is a much better read.
