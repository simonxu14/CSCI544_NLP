The reviews are right, bring out those tissues ladies and gentlemen because the final installment of Harry Potter is so inadequate it will certainly bring you to tears.<br /><br />Let me admit that Rowling did an incredible job throughout the Harry Potter epic up until this book, which in my opinion IS THE MOST IMPORTANT.  I loved her books, which is why I am heart wrenched and disappointed.  She had complete freedom to do anything she wanted, instead she preferred to make various spelling errors, lack of character development, or better yet negative character shifts (especially in Hermione, Ron, Ron's mother, Dumbeldore, and Voldemort), plot holes and MAJOR contradictions.  Majority of the book I believe fell in the former category, but she did produce some marvelous chapters and moments in the book, but not enough.  Nevertheless, it left me wondering if JK Rowling and her Hogwarts Express ran out of steam.<br /><br />The unnecessary deaths of main characters throughout Book 7 have left me greatly confused.  The deaths in Book 7 did nothing for the plot, and did nothing to help aggrandize Harry into a better hero.  Instead, Rowling was hacking a way at people, I believe to lighten her burden of wrapping up the story.<br /><br />There were too many cheesy parallels inside the book:<br />(...)<br /><br />Outside the book:<br />(...)<br />*Do red and green streaks of light fly around only when you perform curses?  I had forgotten that I was reading Harry Potter and not Star Wars.<br /><br />One of Rowling's gifts is that she can take people's imagination and question reality... "what if...could this be true...,"but instead this book lacked any of that, and left readers doubtful, and stuttering in their hands..."hmm, yea right."<br /><br />I am not really sure as to what happened in this book because her other books were so amazing.  I won't get started on the Epilogue.  What I do know is that there is a tremendous lack of original ideas, and the incorporation of too many other people's work in this book without proper transcendence into the Harry Potter Wizarding World.<br /><br />I can only conclude that Rowling was pressed for time and squeezed this out as best she could.  Ugh, how sad to end a wonderful journey like this.  The creation of the Deathly Hallows to sidetrack readers from the Horcuxes and potential "serious" answers to longstanding Harry Potter questions is iniquitous.  But what is more disappointing to me than that is the next time I pick up one of her books I'll be most dubious of it.
