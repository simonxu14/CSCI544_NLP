I must say that I really had expected better ending to the series but you get what they give you right. I must also say that out of the series the first is by far the best and they should have stopped after the first but with that said this is by far the worst in the series. I also have to say that the series is not just for young adults which I am one, but that I think anyone from young to old could really enjoy at least the first book if not the whole series as well.
