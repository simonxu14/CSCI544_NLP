The first two books were ok but this one you can and have to recommend the kids not to read it, reading a summary will not hurt<br />The horrible violent things that this book describes are way too much for young adults to read, seams like fiction but.....<br />As an adult I had to skip several pages to be able to reach the end of the book and don't through it to the trash<br />Definitely not for young adult eyes
