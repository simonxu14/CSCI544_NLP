Mockingjay, in my opinion, was the most different of the three books. It had a lot of twists and surprises that I didn't see coming; even though surprises are usually enjoyable, some of the surprises I didn't really like. It also seemed as if this book was more violent than the others. Obviously, there is going to be violence, hence the purpose of the Hunger Games, but the book seemed to have way more violence than the other books. Instead of trying to get revenge on the Capital, it was more like war against the Capital. I understand why there was a need for a "war," but I just didn't really enjoy how war-like this book was. One the big things I didn't like either was how bad Katniss and her life ended up. I was hoping she would end up better and her life a little happier than that; I wasn't expecting a complete happiness though. It just seemed as if she was just holding on by a thread. Although, I didn't like parts of the book, there were parts that I really liked. The biggest thing I liked the most was who Katniss ended up with! One surprise I enjoyed was who Katniss killed, I never liked that person anyways. Overall, I enjoyed reading Mockinjay along with Catching Fire and The Hunger Games, and anyone who hasn't read these novels yet, should!<br /><br />(P.S.- If you plan on reading the books, I would read them as soon as possible because the movie is coming out March 23!)
