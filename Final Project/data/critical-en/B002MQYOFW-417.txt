Even though the story wasn't complete I wish I would have stopped at the second book. There are more unnecessary deaths and complications and no satisfaction of a decent ending. Even if the overall purpose is to show war is hell, the last book doesn't share the attention to detail and enjoyment of the first two brought. I would recommend against reading this book. Very disappointing.
