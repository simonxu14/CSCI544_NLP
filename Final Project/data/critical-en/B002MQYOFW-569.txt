This book shows up like it sat in the rain along with a library stamped on it, so it might have been stolen? Also there is scribbling throughout the book as if a 2 year old got ahold of it with a pen and scribbled away on it. Used books to me mean that is has some wear and tear on it, this was also a gift for my wife and I have to buy another copy from some where else for I would never give this book out as a gift and in fact I am contacting the library which is stamped on it letting them know I have their book. If it turns out ok then I will donate it to my local book store. I will never use this company again.
