This book was not what I thought it would be...I felt led on only to be disappointed with the ending. I don't understand how it all leads up to a great climatic point and then feel so rushed. I mean come on! I love a great book, but this was ridiculous. It took almost 150 pages for it to start getting good and once it did..I'm so ready for a finish I'm sure will be awesome and it's a complete let down. Do not waste your money on this book just get it from the library...better yet read the chapter summaries online...you'd be better off!!!
