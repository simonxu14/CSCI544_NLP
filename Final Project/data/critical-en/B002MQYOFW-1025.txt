After reading he first two books in the series I was excited to see what happened next.<br />I found the book dragging through the first half.  Although it does pick up later in the book I didn't think that it ended well.  I guess you have to end it somewhere but thought it could had ended differently.  I felt it was missing something.  Not real sure what that something might be.
