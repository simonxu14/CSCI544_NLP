I really liked book 1, and book 2 was good. This one went along ok, but I really, really did not like the ending. I'll try not to spoil anything, but one character I've never really cared about ended up in a situation I totally disapprove of, while a character I always rooted for did not end up where I had really hoped that character would. In a way, it's tarnished the whole series for me, because it means I disagree with the author and was somehow on the wrong track from the beginning. It's just disappointing. As for reviewers who say readers who disapprove wanted a fairy tale, actually I would have been satisfied with much more a tragedy. What it feels like to me is that the author tried to mix in some tragedy and some fairy tale, and I didn't like either of them. I confess myself now disappointed in the series as a whole.
