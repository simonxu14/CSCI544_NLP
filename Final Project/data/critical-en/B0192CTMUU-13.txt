I loved the first three in the series. I felt they were tight and well-crafted. This one felt like Rowling had free rein and just went nuts with this book and the editors figured she was a goldmine and just sent it to press without giving it a read. Yikes! I hope the next ones aren't like this.<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILERS * POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br /><br />Problems:<br /><br />1. No problem with the length, I love a long book. But this book was unnecessarily long. Cut out 150 pages about S.P.E.W. (free the house elves!) that never got resolved and you save yourself quite a bit right there. Why having a huge subplot just to leave it dangling?<br /><br />2. The portkey. If transporting Harry to Voldemart was so simple, why the whole complex Wizard Contest? Just to fill another 200 pages? (A certain someone in the novel had borrowed a certain something from Harry, yeah? He could have just handed it back to him... "thanks for letting me borrow this..." Whoosh! Done!)<br /><br />3. The entire novel was based on the idea that the Goblet of Fire spit out Harry's name. This really bugged me. For one, you have a room full of some of the most powerful wizards on Earth (including Harry) and they can do nothing about this? They are helpless to the power of the goblet? Please. It really really really bugged me that in just a couple of paragraphs they decided to fall prey to the evil plot. They all decide right then and there that a dark force was behind Harry's name "appearing" in the cup but they decide to allow Harry to play anyway against his will because of some "magical contract." PLEASE. If the boy can defeat Voldemart time and time again and he's surrounded by powerful wizards, tell me they couldn't do anything about the stupid cup. It also bothered me that they allow the unfairness period. So Hogsworth gets two champions and the other schools get one? Ridiculous. The whole book was based on a weak plot device. Sorry.<br /><br />In fact, when everyone, including Ron, is totally annoyed with Harry for having his name in the goblet at the beginning of the book- I WAS TOO!!!<br /><br />4. The repeated plot. I'm sorry but every single book is exactly the same. Harry unhappy with his family. Harry goes to school. Harry is trying to be killed. Luckily Harry has his two best friends. The smart one and the one with the temper (red hair). They do a Scooby Do investigation which includes the library and Harry creeping about the castle at night. In the end the Scooby Do surprise unmasking of the bad guy. "The bad guy is.... WOW.... I would have never guessed!!" Voldemart is defeated- once again. It's the old meddlesome kids routine.<br /><br />5. Awful morals. What do we learn? Underage gamblers. Slavery that is OKed because the slaves "like it." One slave is left drinking herself into unconsciousness out of depression. In the end she's considered a bad guy for being used against her will. Severe procrastination with school work and life duties that is always solved for Harry by other people doing his work for him.<br /><br />And my favorite- Harry The Cheater. He doesn't even use magic to cheat. He just cheats. All the time. On his homework for his divination teacher. In the wizard contest. It bugs me that he constantly wins by cheating. And for such a "great wizard" he doesn't figure out anything for himself. Moody gives him hints that are so obvious only a moron would miss the answer. Hermione gives him the spells. Dobby slips him the answer to breath under water. Hagrid shows him the dragons. Cedric tells him how to listen to the egg. Even then the ghost in the bathroom tells him what to do with the egg. He still doesn't figure it out until Dobby tells him what to do. UGH. Why is this kid considered so special? He's just following everyone elses genius!!! At some point Moody tells Harry that cheating is a normal part of the competition. Yep, good thing Harry was involved. He's a pro. Great moral, Rowling.<br /><br />6. I just have to say that drinking polyjuice every hour on the hour for an entire year is a pretty serious commitment on the side of the bad guy.<br /><br />7. And the horror of horrors. The ELLIPSES. Some authors think it's artistic. Some authors use it as a way to write incomplete sentences which I just call lazy writing. But there are parts of the books that have three ellipses or more in one sentence! On one page alone I counted 46 uses of ellipses. The worst is during monologues!! Somebody.... tell Rowling... that people don't.... talk... like this.... And it doesn't... necessarily... make the writing... more powerful... in fact.. it can be... really distracting.... and make you want... to throw the book.... across the room....<br /><br />The ellipses is one reason I know this book wasn't edited. It's just awful. And all the extra pages everywhere that take chapters and chapters to lead up to something very simple. For example, Harry based on "pride" refuses to follow the directions that Cedric gave him over the egg. It takes him several chapters to give in and try it out. Why? WHY???? Just to add in 20 pages? Just to show his lack of genius and his stubborn nature? UGH.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll get lots of "not helpful" votes on this one. Maybe you can explain why any of the above were GOOD plot devices. Just because it's Harry doesn't mean it's good, people!!
