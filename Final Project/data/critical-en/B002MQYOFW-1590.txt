At the end of Catching Fire, I guess I expected the series to focus on the love triangle in the remaining book. Certainly, the love triangle gets resolved in this last installment, but it's not the main theme.  Instead, this book is about the war, and it gets pretty bleak at times. There's a lot of violence, and it's not just battle-type violence - there's a lot of psychological violence and torture. It's ugly, but I guess war is.<br /><br />All three of the main characters change in ways that aren't necessarily the way I wanted things to go. However, I know that no one can go through war without changing, and the changes the characters go through seem consistent with what would really happen to a person in war. I thought Katniss changed less than the others; she starts out raging, and she ends with the same anger-fueled impulsiveness she's shown throughout the series.<br /><br />Did I like the book? I'm not sure. I finished last night after racing through it (on my new Kindle - so cool!). And I suppose I have some sympathy for Katniss, but I just don't like her as much as I would like to.
