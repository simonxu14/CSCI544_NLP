I was at the airport and randomly had picked up The Hunger Games and was immedately caught by the fast paced and gripping story.  I finished the first book in about a day and ordered the next two off of Amazon right away when I returned home.  While I enjoyed Catching Fire, MockingJay left some things to be desired.  It felt like the author was trying to finish the storyline for the sakes of finishing and it simply didn't feel as well put together as teh first two.  The ending was specifically disapointing, without spoiling it, it simply didn't feel like the culimination it should have been.  I recommend this book for the sakes of finishing the storyline but not on the merits of it's standalone execution.
