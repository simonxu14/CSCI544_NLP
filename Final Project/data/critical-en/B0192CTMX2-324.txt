I decided that if I was going to criticize the Potter books I should actually read them.  Having read all 6 books in the series I can say that J.K. Rowling is nowhere near the quality writer that J.R.R. Tolkein and C.S. Lewis were. Second, I would never recommend these books to young readers because of the violence that gets increasingly worse in each succeeding book.  The books  characters, i.e. witches, wizzards, etc. use "good" magic and "bad" magic. There is no such thing as "good" magic. These books stir up an unhealthy interest in the occult and the blackness that accompanies it. Harry Potter and his friends also take great delight in the misfortunes of others and many times contrive to cause these misfortunes to occur to those they dislike.  I would not recommend it for children.  The books are mildly interesting, causing the reader to want to know what happens next, but the story drags on in many places which tends to cause boredom with the story.
