For me, the first book in the series was phenomenal.  The second book wasn't too bad.  The third book, however, was horrible.  This is the first time I have ever completed a customer review/survey and it is only because I want to warn as many Hunger Fans as I can to stop reading at the end of the second book.  The faults I have with "Mocking Jay" are chronicled, in detail, on every review site in the world, so I won't go in depth here.  But I will say that I have never seen an author assassinate their characters like this before.  It was such a pity too, because that first book was so good that, in some weird little way, it had an actual affect on me.
