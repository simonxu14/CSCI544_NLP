As a librarian, I was disappointed in the binding of this book.  I bought this book for my boys (10, 8 & 5 yrs) who love to look through it.  The content is great and very age appropriate, especially considering the recent release of the Pokemon Go game.  However, the cheap binding of the pages (glue only) is a major detractor because it allows for pages to start falling out almost immediately if the book is opened too far for too long.  Scholastic is well-known for  their cheap paper back books though.  Overall, if you don't mind taping pages back into the book frequently, this is a pretty good book.
