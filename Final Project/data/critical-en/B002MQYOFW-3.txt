Like other reviewers, I could not wait for this book to come out.  I am not a particular fan of science fiction but "The Hunger Games" and "Catching Fire" were possibly two of the best books I have read in a long time.  I felt the writer fully pulled me into the world of Panem, and I genuinely cared about all the characters.  I started reading "Mockingjay" the moment it came in the mail (I pre-ordered it), and was fully engrossed immediately.  Then I suddenly began to realize that the author did not really seem to know how to write this book, and it started to feel incredibly disjointed.  Where in the previous books I felt as if I knew the characters and really liked many of them despite (and maybe because of) their flaws, in this book I began to dislike everyone, including Katniss.  It seems as if the author became confused between the statement she wanted to make ("War is wrong no matter what"), and good storytelling.  Peeta, Gale, Katniss, Haymitch etc. took on a paper doll quality and I many times became confused as to what was going on.  The book dragged on and then ended in a rush with no insight into why the characters behaved the way they did.  I was particularly disappointed in the portrayal of Peeta.  Where he was a large part of the previous books, he is but a brief part of this book; like he was an actor that asked for too much money so she wrote him out of the plot!<br /><br />All in all, I felt betrayed by Suzanne Collins.  I wish she would have stayed true to the characters, and given us a book to treasure, a trilogy to read over and over.  Instead, I just want to write my own end to the story.
