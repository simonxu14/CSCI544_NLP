I (57 year old female) enjoyed the book. (I'm also a former teacher, meaning I think I know something about good writing...not much, just some.) The writing was concise, precise and not clich&eacute;d. The plot was interesting. This is a series reminiscent of Harry Potter. It's about kids of a certain age, and should certainly be interesting for kids of that certain age. Part of the draw of the Harry Potter series was how it was written appropriately for the ages of the kids IN the books, which was also the age of the kids READING the books. That trait also makes this particular series fun for ME, an older lady, as it allows me to put myself into the story as a youngster, instead of a sort-of oldster :-)  The Hunger Games series also seems (to me) well-written enough to be enjoyable to a wide range of ages.<br /><br />Now, that said, my husband thought the book (including the story-line) was close to stupid. He was never a 16 year old girl. What does he know?<br /><br />I'll borrow the rest of the series, though, from the public library.
