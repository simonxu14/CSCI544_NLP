I chose to write a review on this book as it is by far the most polarizing in the series.  Yes, it is graphic.  Yes, the war that takes place is violent and political.  For these reasons many feel the book is "realistic."  I disagree.  There is a continuing trend in our culture to create dark works of fiction and sell them to teens and young adults, while omitting anything that resembles human sexuality in order to maintain a "PG-13" feel.  Why violence is acceptable for teen consumption and human sexuality is not should be of great concern to parents.  One is a healthy part of growing up and should be explored in an effort to engage teens in an honest conversation about their sexuality.  Instead, we are creating teen love stories that rival the unrealistic expectations one would find in a Walt Disney fairy tale, yet using violence as a backdrop for romance.  This may explain why so many people were disappointed when Mockingjay's ending suddenly trailed from this expectation.  After all, the book unabashedly engages the reader in unimaginable violence, yet the characters don't curse and don't engage in anything other than chaste love scenes.  Indeed, these chaste love scenes were at the heart of each of the books, which in turn created expectations about how the series should end.  Also, after leaving the reader drained, the author only dedicates a couple of paragraphs to Katniss's journey back from despair.  I think it would have been far more realistic for the reader to experience her emotional journey back, as well as her reconnection with Peeta (and how the war changed them and their love).  Instead, the ending felt rushed and trite.  If anyone is interested in exploring our culture's paradoxical nature when it comes to violence and sex, I highly recommend viewing the documentary "This Film is Not Yet Rated."  As a parent, I feel strongly that this book is not suitable for 7th grade and up as indicated in its reviews.  Thank you.
