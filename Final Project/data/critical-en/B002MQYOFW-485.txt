***************  SPOILER ALERT  ****************************<br /><br />During the first two books, Katniss's primary concern was the well being of those who she loved, like Prim and Peeta. Somehow in this book her motivation was replaced with "I am going to kill Snow." Perhaps, she realized that Prim outgrew her protection, and no longer her concern. Perhaps, the nightmares and dimming of Peeta's light drove her off the edge.<br /><br />With all 12 districts under control of the rebels, the Capitol's fall was inevitable. But, when Peeta arrived, Katniss still made the killing of Snow (a useless mission) the priority, not the well being of Peeta. Why wasn't Katniss reaching out to Peeta? Was her kiss another calculation of hers to disarm a ticking bomb? How could she let Peeta walk on his own in the midst of chaos in the Capitol?<br /><br />Coin did not deserve an assassination. She did opt for a more democratic process, giving the Victors the final votes on the Hunger Games. She let Katiss shoot Snow (if she wanted to).  She held up all ends of her bargain. Violence is not the solution.  Did Katniss not learn nothing from putting down her bow and arrow in District 2?<br /><br />If Susan Collin's main message is that war has damaging effects on the psychology of youth, she has done it poorly. What the last few chapters show are Katniss's lack of concern for Peeta and her recklessness that got members in 451 killed. The blood of Finnick Odair and others is on her hands. Haymitch is right, Peeta is too good for her.
