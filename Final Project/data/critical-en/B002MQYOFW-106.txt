Forget for a moment that this book is the third in a trilogy.  Forget that you're a fan of the previous books.  Instead, look at it as an entity unto itself.<br /><br />On that level, "Mockingjay" is the story of a societal upheaval and class war, narrated by a character who is absent from the majority of the action.  A doting character who spends more time anxiously wondering when her two potential lovers will come home from battle (and which of them she'll choose), rather than having a part in the battle herself.  Who spends several moments drugged or unconscious (again, this is the NARRATOR), and has characters explain to her in giant expository blocks of dialogue how the story moved forward without her while she was out.  A character who can't make decisions, and instead allows story contrivances to make choices for her.  These things describe a pretty bad book.<br /><br />NOW think about the fact that the weak character described here is Katniss Everdeen, the proactive, no-nonsense, survivalist hero of "The Hunger Games" and "Catching Fire."<br /><br />It's no longer just a "bad book."  It's a travesty.<br /><br />Apologists seem to think that the negative reviews are from readers who couldn't handle how "dark" this book is, who didn't like that it ends with no "happily ever after" moment, but this isn't true.  The problem isn't that the story goes places fans don't want it to go.  The problem is that it's a poor story, poorly-told.  It is really that simple.  Beyond what's above, the book introduces numerous bland "red-shirt" characters you're meant to care for (SPOILER: you don't) only so it can wring some emotion from you when they're summarily killed off.  Even the characters from the previous books act out-of-character to the point that they're nearly unrecognizable.  The narrative action is poorly-written and oftentimes difficult to follow.<br /><br />As for the ending itself, for all the claims of how "true to life" it's meant to be, it's remarkably contrived, especially in how Collins ONCE AGAIN shoehorns the titular Games into the story.  Everything about it feels false.  Events occur that are cloying and manipulative, and it's shameful.  This book feels like the result of Collins being forced to get this book finished so they could get to work on the films.<br /><br />It's bad enough to make you want to blot it from your memory as not existing in the Hunger Games universe.  A sad whimper of a way to close out such a great series.
