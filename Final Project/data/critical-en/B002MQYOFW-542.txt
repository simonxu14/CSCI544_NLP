While loving book 1 and book 2, Book 3 left me disappointed.  It does provide closure, however it seems to waiver, or muddle through the story line.  Katniss, the strong heroin - changes is the best way to put it.  To me, it seems that Collins was lost for an ending and ended up getting too tied up in the details to write a steallr conclusion to an epic series.<br /><br />You'll be left looking for more out of some charcters adn too much out of others.  The problem is it is a must read to finish up the story line.
