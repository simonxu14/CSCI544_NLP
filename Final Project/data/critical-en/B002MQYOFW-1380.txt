While this review is short, I must make it clear that I LOVED the first two books. I loaned them out and sang their praises. Like most other Hunger Games fans, I pre-ordered Mockingjay in February 2010 and waited six months for the arrival. And there - the day I found it in my mailbox, was the height of the excitement for Mockingjay. Katniss Everdeen was no longer inspiring, not a fighter - the TWO characteristics that made her THE STORY. ****SPOILER ALERT**** Sure, the fight was taken from her when she couldn't get to Peeta, but when finally... when he was returned from his totally anti-climatic rescue, she behaved as a spoiled child - the one thing she was never. I won't go on with specifics, I will just point out what so many others have - I wasn't looking for an "everybody's happy" ending, but the wasn't one twist, not one amazing turn. The ending was the downer of the year - this book ruined the first two.
