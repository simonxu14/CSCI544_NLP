I read through the trilogy over the span of two weeks while traveling. I enjoyed book one and was intrigued by the cliffhanger feel of book two. The characters were developing and I couldn't wait to read this. I even avoided reviews since I wanted to go in with a fresh take, but I found myself agreeing with many of the book's critics after.<br /><br />Let's just say that Hollywood chose the WRONG book to split into two films because this is just sloppy and bad. Characters that were developing are thrown into a shredder here. And it seems like character deaths are just thrown in at random moments for shock value. I believe many previous reviewers have broken it down already.<br /><br />That being said, I'll be happy if, character-wise, the final split films stray far away from this.
