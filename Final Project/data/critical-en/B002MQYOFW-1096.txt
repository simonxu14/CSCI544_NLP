I'll start out by saying I never read the first 2 books. I just saw the movies.  I only made it thru the first 100 pages of this book.  It is incredibly slow moving and boring.  I'm surprised that so many people actually like these books.  I'll just wait for the movies to come out.  I'd rather watch paint dry than read anymore of this.
