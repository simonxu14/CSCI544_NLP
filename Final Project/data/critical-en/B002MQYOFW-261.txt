This book damn near bored me to tears. It read like a play by play of tactical warfare. &#34;We went down this street, then we flanked left, then we made our way up another street, we checked all the windows, then we slept for the night and somebody kept watch, then we woke  up early and walked down some more streets.&#34; This one was hard for me to get through.
