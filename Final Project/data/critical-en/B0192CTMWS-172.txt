Short and Sweet Review, by Michelle:<br />Ahh, all good things must come to an end. I am a Harry Potter nut. Why the three stars then? Well, I don't know to be honest with you. I "liked it", but I just don't know if I can go further than that. Maybe 3.5 stars? What really ruined the book for me was the epilogue. Had Ms. Rowling not included the epilogue, I think I could have gone with 4 stars. It just felt so cheesy after all the darkness that we've experienced throughout the development of the story.<br /><br />Eh, well, I think that's all I really need to say. I highly doubt someone is scouring reviews of Harry Potter to decide if they're going to read it or not. ;) So I'll keep in short & sweet, per usual!
