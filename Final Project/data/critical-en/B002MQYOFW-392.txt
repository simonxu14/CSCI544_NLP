This is one of those books that you read just because you read the other books. I found the love triangle annoying and more like a soap opera, rather than it being engaging. I also ended up not liking Katniss as much by the end of the book (mainly because of the way she handled the Peeta and Gale love triangle). The book wasn't horrible and I still think anyone who read the other books should read it, if for no other reason than to see how it ends.
