I really liked the "The Hunger Games" trilogy and story.  This series features good characterizations, excellent speculation concerning a possible post-apocalyptic and unjust society, and generally excellent writing by the author.  The first volume is dazzling.  This third volume in my opinion drags quite a bit in the middle, and could have used more editing.  I wanted to love this third novel in the series.  Instead, I only liked it. Still, those who enjoyed the first two novels in the series will not want to miss this one. RJB.
