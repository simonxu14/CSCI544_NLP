As with the rest of the series, this is not a bad book.  The premise is rather twisted and not a "feel good" type of story and even the relationships are very tentative and very "settle for the ruins" style.<br /><br />This book and the predecessor end very abruptly (like the author ran out paper or used up all the allotted characters) but I have to admit the writing was not bad and the story is alright (if disturbing).
