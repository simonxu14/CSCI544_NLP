I must be the only one in the universe who thought Hunger Games (The Trilogy) was just OK.  I would have given a lower star ranking based on the 2nd and 3rd books which were, in my opinion less than stellar but the first book was interesting enough for me to give the series a 3 star ranking overall.<br /><br />The first book, The Hunger Games was a little slow starting but once I got through the shocking violence (truly, this can't be for tweens, let alone teens to read...the violence is definitely PG (pretty gross)), I actually thought the story was pretty interesting.  Katniss, the reluctant heroine was predictable through all three books.  I enjoyed her adventurous spirit in the first book but I did not like the depressed, suicidal girl she became in the third book.<br /><br />I think it is for that reason that I found the last book in the series, Mockingjay to be one of the most bleak novels I had ever read.  There was no sense of hope, not really a happy ending either.<br /><br />On the eve before the movie "Hunger Games" hits the theatres I wonder if I will think for the first time that the movie will be better than the book.  I guess I'll find out.
