Reminded me a lot of the plot of The Running Man (Arnold Schwartzenager movie from the 1980s) but with sympathetic YA characters and some engaging writing.  The book is very readable, but I think that avid readers of sci-fi and fantasy may want a little more depth and originality -- I did anyway.  There is very little "how we got there" for the society, and its not compelling.  A vastly better job is done on the family circumstances/personal background of the hero.  The flip-flopping pettiness of the evil leaders from the capital wasnt very credible, and the romance didnt feel terribly well done to me either.<br /><br />Verdict:  3 1/2 stars; nice beach read that may actually make you nostalgic for The Running Man, which I havent thought about in 20 years.
