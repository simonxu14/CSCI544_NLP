"Hunger Games" and the follow-up sequel "Catching Fire" are page-turning reads because they are able to capture our imagination through a combination of adventure and angst. I felt that "Hunger Games" was the better of the two, because, while any many ways disturbing, was more of an adventure tale. "Catching Fire" retained many of the key ingredients, but started to focus increasingly on the political sentiment and angst within Katniss. Finally, we have Mockingjay, the third part of the trilogy, and while there are some dramatic moments they seem to get lost in loathing and anger expressed by Katniss.<br /><br />  In some ways it is subtle, but the end effect is that "Mockingjay" is a much slower read, and at times you begin to doubt if you even care about the final outcome. Truthfully, "Mockingjay" probably should have left about 100 pages on the editor's floor (mostly in the first half of the book). Better yet, "Catching Fire" and "Mockingjay" could have been combined into a single book. I think this could have helped with the flow of the entire triology... but hey that is just my opinion.<br /><br />Other reviewers have mentioned it, but I feel that Suzanne Collins missed an opportunity for a literary home run with "Mockingjay". While this story does serve as a tidy conclusion (i.e. there are not many loose ends that were not tied up) it does not seem totally satisfying.<br /><br />One thing that may be worth noting, "Mockingjay" on its own does not hold up as an independent book. Meaning, if you want to read "Mockingjay" you will need to read the first two books of the trilogy.<br /><br />Final Verdict - Not much to say here.... if you read "Hunger Games" and "Catching Fire" I doubt if you will pass on "Mockingjay". Conversely, I doubt anyone will decide to begin reading the trilogy strictly based on the reviews of "Mockingjay".<br /><br />3 Stars
