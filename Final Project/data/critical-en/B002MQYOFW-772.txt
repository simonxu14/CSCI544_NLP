I really loved the movies, so in the event of waiting for Mockingjay to come out, I needed to read the whole series. While reading Mockingjay was great, I have to say the ending left me sorely disappointed.<br /><br />***SPOILERS***<br /><br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />Dont read if you havent had the chance to read it yet --<br /><br />Anyway, I understand the reasoning behind leaving Peeta out of a majority of the book, because we end Catching Fire with him being captured and all by the Capitol. However, after Part I I was very excited, I thought, there's going to be resolution and a reunion with him and Katniss, and it never happened. It's soooo disappointing, because you're waiting for it the whole book, and nothing. I didn't like her attitude towards Peeta in the middle, and I didn't like the zero resolution between the two at the end. It was told how it happened in a paragraph, where I could have done with the last couple of pages between them two, hashing out everything that happened, reconnecting in love, and ended it with, &#34;Do you love me, real or not real&#34; -- &#34;real&#34; and a paragraph on how the story ends in her own personal reflection on the previous events. It just doesn't happen that way, and again, I closed the book and kind of felt like, that's it? It's over? That's how it ends?
