The content of the book that is the story is as good as the story is...  my daughter loves it so the content gets 5 star.  As fort the book itself, that is the paper and the ink, it is as cheap as they come.  The paper is greyish and thin.  The ink is not very dark so the print lacks contrast on the greyish paper.  If it was for me, I would not be happy with this product, but my daughter loved it and read half of it in about 1 week.  I will most likely buy the next one from the same seller unless I find a better quality one at the same price somewhere else.
