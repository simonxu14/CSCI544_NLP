There were so many different roads the writer could have chosen, why the worst one?  The book was extremely boring compared to the first two. It dragged on and on without getting to the point and just when I thought its getting good, it goes downhill. So disappointed. She made the main characters unlikable, the romance between Katniss & Peeta and Katniss & Gale never blossomed into anything remotely romantic ....maybe its one of those books you gotta read and reread to understand
