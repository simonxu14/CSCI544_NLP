I liked Hunger Games better than the Twilight series, but that's not saying much. Still, in fairness, I realize I'm probably not the target demo for this book. It was an entertaining series, and I liked the concept (once I got  over the issue of parents letting their kids face off against each other in death matches). However, as the series evolves, the author's need to find ever more creative ways the kill characters begins to border on silly.<br /><br />I don't know if I'd recommend this series. If you do purchase it be prepared to suspend any notions of logic, reality, and common sense.
