This book wasnt near as good as the others. In the beginning/middle, I thought the book was okay. Once I got to the end I was like...are you kidding me!? Until the last few pages I was expecting Katniss to wake up as if she was dreaming all of it. It's like Suzanne couldnt think of anything and just decided to end the book . Like I said, I'm so mad at Suzanne and her dissapointing ending to a great series. If you get this book, you are in for a let down  I am never reading this book again.
