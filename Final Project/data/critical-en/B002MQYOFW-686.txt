The first book, The Hunger Games, I found interesting.  Very imaginative plot, however, the dialogue in this book, and all three, I found very dull.  The second two books were a disappointment. Since they were so well reviewed, that is why I decided to read them.  I didn't find myself particularly interested in any of the characters, and the action didn't seem to be moving anywhere.  There is a lot of death, alot of destruction, alot of angst, and a lot of rebellion.  To what end?  I kept reading, hoping it would improve or actually get somewhere.  In my opinion, it never did.  I didn't even finish the third book.<br /><br />I'm sorry but I do not see the attraction of this series, and can't fathom why the trilogy is the top seller on Amazon's fiction list.  These books reminded me of the Twilight series; an interesting idea never really fleshed out with competent writing or believeable characters.
