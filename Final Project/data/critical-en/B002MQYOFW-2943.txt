While the first two books of this series are very good, the final book, "Mockingjay" was a total let down.  If you truly do not want an anticlimaxtic ending that reduces characters you've grown to love into mere side stories I would avoid this series.  Not a "happy ending" we would want for ourselves or our children.  Consider yourselves warned.
