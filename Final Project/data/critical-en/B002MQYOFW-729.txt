First, I loved the first two books. The first half of this book is great and keeps you captivated just like the first two books. However (I am attempting to be vague in order to not spoil the book), it seems that this book drags on a bit. Also some other deaths are buried in the middle of chapters and it seems as though their deaths are insignificant. Then the end seems a bit rushed. All-in-all, I am glad that I read this book and I loved the series!
