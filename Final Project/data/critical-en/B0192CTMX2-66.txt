Yes, I am one of those adults who likes the Harry Potter books. Or at least until this one. Sure, it is still an escape from reality and some of the new characters are interesting, but overall, big thumbs down. The magic and charm (sorry for the bad puns) of the first four is sorely missed here. Book five feels forced, as though she just wanted to get it over and done with. There's no heart or soul to it. I understand that we need to feel the discomfort, claustrophia and pain that the characters are living with, but with nothing pushing the plot along, it was wholly unenjoyable. Three years...so long to wait for so little...
