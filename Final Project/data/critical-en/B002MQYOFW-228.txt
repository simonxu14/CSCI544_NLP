**MAJOR MAJOR SPOILERS**<br /><br />I decided I don't want to rate it, I think I'll need a whole re-read to make up my mind, and since it's not possible not to rate, I'll give three stars.<br /><br />There's something that appeals to me, because I don't care too much for perfect, wrapped-up endings, but there's something so hopeless here that not even Katniss' last act of defiance could make up for what had happened.<br /><br />I think the author didn't give her characters the opportunity to stand up to their fate. She took away Peeta's sanity and made a shell of him, takinf away the only source of warmth in the book. She didn't allow Katniss to be less passive, to have a say in her life. I wish she would have let Katniss defend herself on the last trial against her and not have something like this happen off page.<br /><br />I think what really makes me feel sick, profoundly so, is that after all her trouble, what Katniss did in the first book was all for nothing. She did it for Prim and it was useless. Gale's proficiency with traps was an element for that ending. Since Gale almost disappears at the end of the book, we'll never know if he has to leave with the guilt or if he justified it to achieve a goal.<br /><br />There's something else that I didn't understand: why do they have the previous victors decide if there should be an edition of the Hunger Games with the Capitol chidren and then no one didn't mention the fact anymore? It was important, but it seemed very incidental.<br /><br />I don't know what to think. There's a brave grittiness in the book, but I can't help feeling it didn't perfectly succeed in achieving all its goals. It's a series which deserves to be read though.
