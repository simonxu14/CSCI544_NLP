I found Mockingjay, the final book of the hunger games to be less interesting than the others.  Firstly, almost all the main characters go crazy. There's also an unsatisfying ending that concludes abruptly. I would have preferred to know how the government worked after the revolution and what happens to the different characters.  The first two books were written well and had original ideas. The last book was written well but it doesn't catch the readers attention as much. All in all, Mockingjay did not live up to my expectations and did not live up to the first two books but is still worth reading.
