I also loved the first two books. Read them and listened to both on CD with husband on roadtrips. I was so excited about this book and began reading it on my kindle. I kept thinking "this is slow, but it'll pick up." Then I realized that my kindle was telling me that I was 56% through the book, then 80% through the book, then even 94% through the book. And when it finally did pick up, the cleverness in creating a believable yet fascinating outcome was just not there. Where did the author go? What happened? How is the book getting such stellar reviews? Aren't the other lovers of this series just as disappointed as I am or did I somehow download the wrong book with the same characters? The book barely gets going and when it does it's so unbelievable. And the love triangle? Are you kidding me? This book made me dislike all three characters. I didn't care who ended up with who by the end. It was so poorly addressed and resolved that it's almost like someone else wrote this book. The author in the first two books loved her characters. The author of this book was just trying to come up with something quickly, wrote it down and sent it to press. I am thoroughly disappointed that this series ended with this book. I wish the author could do a re-write.
