The Hunger Games is supposedly a book written well; of an adventure. But, as I read the first few pages, I instantly got bored. It was a waste to spend my money on a book that was very deceitful to me. I soon read on the first few chapters and realized I had gotten no where. The plot and the spark weren't in me, as usually, most books I enjoy. I hope that future readers will not buy this book for its boring plot and characters.
