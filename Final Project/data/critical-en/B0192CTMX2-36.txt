While "Order of the Phoenix" was a great attempt, it simply did not have the magic of the other four books.<br />As a twenty-somthing-year old, I was suprised at how many of my peers recomended the series. After reading the first book, I was hooked! The first four books were humorous and had great characters that one could really relate to. They also had twists in the storyline and a mystery like feel that attracted adults as well as children. This book lost much of that.<br />While there is an attempt to show the character growth of Harry, in this book he becomes very unlikeable with an explosive temper, and an annoying aroggance. While it may have been a major plot point, it only served to make Harry's character unlikeable.<br />The story was extremely linear with no plot twists, and easily predictable. Even the side story with Hagrid served no purpose to move the story forward whatsoever.<br />After reading book 4 I was dying to read book 5 and like many other fans waited years for what seemed like a cliff hanger ending to book 4. what I found was that book 5 was basicly a gigantic conlcusion to book 4, and after finishing it, I certainly won't mind waiting 1, 3, or 5 more years for the next installment. I just pray that Harry will get his "magic" back.
