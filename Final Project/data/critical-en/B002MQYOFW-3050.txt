I don't know...this book kind of left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe I'm too faint-hearted for all this killing, but something just felt off somehow.<br />Its not that I want the storybook ending, but I think that for a story to be worth telling, it should be a story where some sort of transformation occurs. Why was this story told? What was so extraordinary about it? By the end our protagonist is beaten down to a point where she is unrecognizable.<br /><br />A lot of people here are writing that this book gives us reality. But what is so great about real? What sets this story apart? Why was this story told instead of the other thousands of stories? How did anyone overcome anything?<br /><br />Look, this world is depressing and horrible enough as it is. If you are going to go through the trouble of making up a story, tell us one where people are good, where they rise above something. Inspire us!<br /><br />I lost sleep over these books, they were troubling. Mockingjay was rushed and unresolved. Suzanne told us about the bad in the world, but she didn't really tell us about the good.
