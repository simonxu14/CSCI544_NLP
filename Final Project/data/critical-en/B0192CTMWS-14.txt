Okay as always great book by J. K. Rowling.  But this particular copy or print if you will is substandard.  Swear it's like holding a copy of the bible. No joke the paper is horribly thin. Like bible paper. I bought each book and this was the only copy with this horribly thin,  see though paper. To top it off the cover is not properly cut. Close the book and you see paper over the cover. Just a bad print in all. Would not recommend.
