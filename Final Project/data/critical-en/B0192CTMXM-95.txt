This review refers exclusively to the audiobook.  The book itself is nothing short of remarkable: perfect, no, but really, really amazing.<br /><br />The audiobooks, however, are a lot less than perfect.  The positives are that the discs are unabridged, and that all the reading is not bad.  The bad part is the really the reader: he's terribly limited.  He thinks that a female voice is distinguished by elongated final vowels (&#34;Harryyyyyy&#34; is how Hermione refers to Harry; and how every other female speaks too).  I wonder if the guy knows any women or if he has ever heard a woman speak.  It's quite annoying after 7 novels (heck, it was annoying the first time).  I am no expert in British and English dialects, but he seems terribly limited.  Most British voices are lower-class dialects; it's hard to accept hearing everyone but 5 or so people swallowing syllables and distorting vowels a la Pygmalion (tho not as exaggerated as that; still...).  It gets tiresome and in the case of most of the females, it's exhausting.  Hopefully one day this will be recorded again in total and by a more talented or more careful reader.
