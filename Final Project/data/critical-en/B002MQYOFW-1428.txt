I bought the trilogy because of the savings and I wish I had only bought the first in the series.<br /><br />This eBook is edited well.<br /><br />The first book starts out pretty strong but quickly began to lose me. The author takes a strong willed, lonely huntress and turns her into a puppet for opposing forces. The plot was ultimately a let down as well as the treatment of the heroine. There was a lot, a lot, of focus on make up crews and posing for cameras which seemed to replace any actual story line...<br /><br />The second and third book felt rushed and anemic. They had a tacked on feel that seemed like the author needed to reach a deadline to fulfill a contract.
