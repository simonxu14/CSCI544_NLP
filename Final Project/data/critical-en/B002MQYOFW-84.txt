The first book was fascinating and moving.  The second kept up with the first, but no major surprises.  The third was just a big fat disappointment.  I don't like that all three books beat and beat and beat Katniss down until she couldn't even appreciate having a child fully.  Unbelievable to take the main character, the one who started out with the intention of protecting the ones she loves, and turn her strip her bare.  Make he crazy, suck the spirit of life from her, just down right suicidal and pathetic.  Books are supposed to give me something to hold onto when I'm finished reading them.  All this book gave me to hold onto was that perhaps the dull existence that most of us are living is the best it's gonna get and I should just accept that.  Way to go Collins.  You've inspired us all to accept our realities rather than reach out and attempt some sort of greatness.<br /><br />I'm pissed.  I wish I would have never read the last book.
