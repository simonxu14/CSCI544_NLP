There's 2 main problems plaguing this handbook:<br />1. Organization<br />2. Lack of Information<br /><br />The organization of this book is an absolutely egregious blunder. It's organized alphabetically. Now mind you, I LOVE alphabetical organization in most books. But in Pokemon it makes no sense. I can understand that the old numerical system also got hard to handle once kid pokemon like igglybuff and pichu got mixed in. But with the current system a pokemon and it's evolution are separated, often by huge chunks of pages. Say I want to read all of the information on bulbasaur and see how it changes as it evolves. I have to start at the B's, hunt my way through the I's, and finally forage my way through the V's. In the older style handbooks, they would all be right next to each other. It's just a huge pain.<br /><br />The information in the book is also particularly lacking compared to it's older counterparts. It will show you what a pokemon evolves into, but not how or at what level. Most pokemon get a very very quick overview. Perhaps 2-3 sentences tops. It's just very uninformative.<br /><br />All in all if you're not seriously perusing it for detailed information like I was and are just looking for something to flip through on occasion, I absolutely recommend it. The art is as good as ever and what can I say, it's fun just to browse. If you have a kid in the family who's into pokemon, they'll love this as a gift.<br /><br />But if you're looking for something with information on how to evolve your pokemon or a more thorough background on them, I recommend online resources such as Bulbapedia.
