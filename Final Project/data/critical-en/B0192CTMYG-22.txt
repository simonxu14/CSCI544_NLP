This set of audio disks did not meet my needs well. In my study of Spanish I wanted to use the audio recordings along with a printed text, but the recording is read from a different translation than the one that I have in print. If my knowledge of Spanish were at a higher level, these recordings along with my printed text might make an interesting study of how different two translations of the same material can be.
