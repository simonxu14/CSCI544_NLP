Entertaining, yes. Downright riveting, in fact. Un-put-down-able, as ususal. But even the most rabid HP fan (and I'm one of them) has to admit that this is WAY WAY WAY too long. It took 200 pages just to get Harry to Hogwarts, and, I'm sorry, but Sirius's house is just not that interesting (certainly nowhere near as interesting as the Weasley's burrow). The first week at Hogwarts dragged on and on. And the whole 'Harry being misunderstood and oppressed' theme, while central to the story, was overemphasized to the point of predictability. Hmm...what will Umbridge do to him next, I wonder? By the time the whole Quidditch fiasco took place, I was no longer surprised -- instead, it was more like "yeah, got it, no one believes or likes Harry, he's getting screwed left and right, so when's this going to turn around already?" Don't get me wrong, this is still a magical, wonderful must-read, and I already can't wait for #6. I just wish Rowling would use a bit more editorial restraint. I mean, this was longer than #4, and that included the Quidditch World Cup. What did all the extra pages here give us? Detention with Umbridge? Another predictably awkward conversation with Cho? It feels like Rowling included too many B-sides here along with all those immensely enjoyable hit singles.
