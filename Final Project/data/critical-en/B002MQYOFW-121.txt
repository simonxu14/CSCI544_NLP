I really liked the first novel and liked the second one even better.  And of course, in true cliffhanger style, the second novel leaves you NEEDING to read the final one unless you're okay with walking away from a totally unresolved story.<br /><br />Sad to say, I probably should have walked away.  To say the final installment was "dark" is an understatement (as if the previous two were light-hearted affairs).  In a lot of ways, this trilogy reminds me of the Matrix trilogy, in that the first installment hooked everybody, the second one some people loved and some people hated, but the third inexplicably plummeted into darkness and all-around misery for all the main characters.  Characters to whom you had built an attachment/affection, so you end up with a nasty taste in your mouth.<br /><br />Look, I get the whole war-is-bad thing and how all too often one side will exploit its people just as much as the other--but was it really necessary to pound that message home by inflicting such horror on all the heroes of the story?<br /><br />To put it succinctly, after finishing the second book (and remember, the second book re-animated the main plot device from the first book), you felt a buzz and a natural eagerness to snatch up the third.<br /><br />Upon finishing the third, though, you just felt: bummed.  I didn't need it to be a Disney ending, but damn.  And the tacked-on "epilogue" (which smacked of an attempt to alleviate the bleak ending) seemed just that: tacked on.<br /><br />Maybe they can rework this all when or if it becomes a movie, but sorry: two out of three worked here.  I mean it seriously when I say you could leave it at the second book and walk away satisfied.  In this instance, finding out what happened didn't produce any sort of closure or resolution--just bitterness.
