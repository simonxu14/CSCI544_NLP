Maybe I need to give myself some time after finishing this book, but I don't like it.  The first two books were good, but not great.  I understand why, but with Katniss not being able to consciously love anyone I felt like we kept going through the same old steps; even in this book it was just like going back to the games.  You had to keep fighting and everything got put on hold.  At the end of the third book I realized that Prim may be the true love interest, of course not in a romantic way.<br /><br />I just feel so let down.  There wasn't a big conclusion where you say finally, there it is, that's what I've been waiting for.  Besides war is bad and people are not going to be perfect, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to get out of it.  Maybe making every moment count?  Again, this is probably why I should give myself a little while before analyzing my thoughts.<br /><br />*Spoiler* I don't know if anyone else felt like it, but even though I knew half way through this book that she was going to end up with Peeta, I feel like at the end she did just because he was there.  Not because she loved him, even though I think she did.  I believe she needed him, but the author did not convey this.  Had I been able to feel their combined love at the end, which we haven't had yet, I think it would have been worth it.
