Okay, so I was told that these books were good and that the movies were awesome. So far, quite opposite. I don't find anything relating to mass marketing and exploitation of hunger to be of anything fun or entertaining. It's like Lost, here in America its a game and we can win a million dollars, but there are people, millions of them, where that is not a game, there is no million dollar prize, and that is the crappy life they have to live every day. I see stories like this one just a kick in the face to anybody who has had to go to bed hungry, or can't afford to get enough food for their family, or is starved. It's sad. These books should be ashamed of the desensitization of real world epidemics. It's not a game. It's not entertainment. It's reality, and people live in it daily and seeing others act like it is just a game, its fake, not real, and won't effect affect them is absolutely asinine.
