The first one was good, the second okay, but the third disappointed me.  I kept putting it down and forcing myself to come back and finish it.<br />I think it's mainly because the character of Katniss is SO unlikeable.  She is selfish, bratty, and I just want to shake her.  I understand that the author means to convey the traits "fierce" and "independent", but she fails to do so as Katniss seems to complain constantly, and be ever-so-ready to betray or hurt someone.<br />Perhaps the author realized she didn't have to portray Katniss as someone for us to like.  We all love Peeta, and that's what makes us root for Katniss, his survival and well-being depends on her survival.  The end was so depressing.  The whole book was depressing.<br />***SPOILERS below, questions I have?<br /><br />Why was it not elaborated at the trial that Coin had used her as a pawn, and therefore let off for something else, but not because she was "insane"?<br />Why was Prim in the Capitol?  I thought she was working in the hospital to care for the injured. How could Gale give up so easily? Not even a visit, nor an explanation to Katniss? (And for us readers?)
