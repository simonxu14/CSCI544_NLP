While the story is enchanting, the day I got the tapes tape #4 BROKE in my tape player, being soooooo thin that the quality of it did not hold up to normal play.  I would advise people to get it in hardcover rather than waste their money on an audio book version; I will now NOT know what happened on tape 4, and that is VERRRRY upsetting to me.
