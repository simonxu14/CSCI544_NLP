Loved the first two books, and couldn't wait to get into this one.  Was ok, but not great.  Anticlimactic ending. Ends on kind of a downer.  Character development weaker in this book.  Rebellion/war against capitol develops really fast with little or no detail.  One chapter she becomes the face of the rebellion, and it seems like by the next, it's almost over.  Overall, a little disappointing.
