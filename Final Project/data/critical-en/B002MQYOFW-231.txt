****Warning Spoiler Alert****<br />If you haven't read the book, you probably won't want to read my review. So stop here if you don't want to know what happens.<br /><br />I don't like investing a lot of time in a series where the ending leaves me depressed. Suzanne Collins' success at sharing the horrors of political oppression and war with people who might not have put any thought into it is very successful. Well done. I personally found it difficult to follow when her main characters basically went mad because of what they'd been through. Knowing that Gale was the one who killed Prim in the end just sickened me. I had a lot of emotion wrapped up in both characters. It was also very hard to understand why Katniss would vote for the continuation of the Hunger Games when that was exactly what she'd been fighting against. In the end, she makes a choice that will effectively end them, but when it came for a vote, she chose to vote for them. How can you not feel ill about her choices when you've lived through so many harrowing events with the characters? In the end, you have two very wounded people who are living the best they can. Not a "happily ever after" story. And maybe that's what she wanted to portray. All of us are wounded in some way and are living our lives the best we can.
