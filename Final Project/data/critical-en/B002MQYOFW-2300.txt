I loved the first two books in the series, but Mockingjay just didn't do it for me for the following reasons:<br /><br />1. I started to really dislike Katniss. All she did in this book was whine, pout, or hide in a broom closet.<br /><br />2. I feel like the writing was incredibly disjointed. There was so much potential for this book to be a phenomenal ending to the series but instead it was a waste of pages. The plot went all over the place, the dialogue was crap and the relationships that were so interesting got boring.<br /><br />3. The ending sucked. It felt like she didn't really know how to end it so she just rushed through it. I'm glad she ended up with Peeta because I did start to root for him more than Gale, but it felt like the connection that they had was lost by the end of the book. He went from being crazy to marrying Katniss with not much in between.
