While there were moments of brilliance in the story line and developing circumstances surrounding the characters, I was completely sickened by the concept...how could the parent of children think up such an awful scenario?  I am still bewildered by that, and I marvel that so many people were captured by it, attempting to see some deep message about governments.  It is nothing less than disturbing, and points to a life without faith in anything but self.  A very sad commentary indeed.  Fortunately not mine.  Happy reading, but work hard to avoid depression when its over.
