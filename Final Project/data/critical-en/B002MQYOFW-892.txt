*SPOILERS AHEAD*<br />Like most people I ate up the first two books in the Hunger Games series, but very dissapointed in Mockingjay.<br /><br />After I first finished the book I lay in my bed with an unsettling feeling in my stomach that I couldn't quite place. It felt as if the series wasn't really over, but it was. And the ending really irked me.<br /><br />First I'd liketo say the characters really annoyed me. Starting with Katniss. Katniss, who had been such an inspirational hero in the first two book, came back as a coward for the last book. What happened to the girl who had so willingly sacrificed herself for her sister and Peeta in the first two books? Instead we are left with a living dead girl for most of the book, who happens to be conveniently in the hospital everytime something important happens. I know everyone thinks Katniss died the second she volunteered to take her sister's place in the games, but I just don' t think that's true. The Katniss Everdeen I read in the last two books was a survivor. The one who appeared in Mockingjay just gave up.<br /><br />Next I would like to say Gale was not his usual self. The kisses they shared in this book were detached of any emotion other then self-pity. Katniss would kiss him because she assumed she assumed she would never get Peeta back and Gale was her only other option. He would kiss her because he knew this was probably true. When Peeta finally does come back Gale is pushing her to make a choice. Which is why it is such a shock that he gave up so easily at the end. I didn't like the way this relationship ended. There was too many questions to be answered. For two people who loved eachother so much they certainly gave up on their friendship pretty fast. I was mad at her for blaming him for something that was our of his control and I was mad at him for taking defeat and just accepting the fact that she would always blame him for Prim's death, without so much as an explanation on his part. That ending left much to be desired.<br /><br />Next is Peeta. I have to admit I have been team Peeta all along. The ending was what I wanted, but not the way I wanted it. Although it was heartbreaking Katniss needed that break from Peeta to realize she needed him to function at her best. When she finally gets him back all he wants to do is kill her. Peeta's hijacking just adds to an already confusing plot. To make matters worse Collins keep setting it up to make you believe that Peeta will be able to reverse his hijacking, but in the end he is just a shell of the kind, incredible boy he once was. Though they end up together in the end I feel like it wasn't even really them. It was these two completely different people who never really got back to who they once were.<br /><br />I found the storyline confusing and hard to follow at some parts. Mostly during team 451's quest to the capital I found the pods confusing and all the random deaths mixed in together had me reading over the paragraphs making sure I got it right. I felt some of the character's were disposable. Even character's we had known for a while, like Finnick. When he first is killed you don't feel anything for him, the tragedy comes later when you find out he has a son on the way. I also found Prim's death an unessessary tragedy. I felt like it was just a way to get rid of the last person Katniss cared about and trusted with all their heart.<br /><br />The ending was a bitterly realistic look on the affects war and tragedy can do to a person. I hoped her and Peeta would heal each other,but instead they reamain the broken shells of people they once were. I interprate her parting thoughts as "My life sucks, but if could be worse".<br /><br />A little too much reality for a teen fiction novel.
