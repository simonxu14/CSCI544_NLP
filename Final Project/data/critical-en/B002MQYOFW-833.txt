The first book in this series was adequate. Not masterful, but not an unreadable mess. Katniss was a strong-willed character who pushed through great hardship and prevailed. The romantic side bored me, but whatever. The second book was the same. Merely adequate. Mockingjay, however, is just bad. She took the determined, iron-willed teen who had fed her family in a poverty-stricken city for years and turned that powerful person into a crying, whiny, useless child who can't do anything without help or permission. Then Collins kills the only thing holding the boring rag together off, Finnick, along with every slightly interesting character in literally a single chapter. I stopped reading there,because this book is a pile of garbage. Any "fans" will be disappointed.
