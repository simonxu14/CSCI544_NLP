Harry Potter & the Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone is one of the great books of our era. Please do not interpret this review as concerning the BOOK; it concerns the PRODUCT on offer - the Kindle version that forces you to buy through Pottermore.<br /><br />My experience with Pottermore is perhaps the worst e-commerce experience I've had in half a decade. I attempted to buy the book from my Kindle, failed, then tried from my PC using Chrome (failed) and IE (failed). The result was the same on each attempt, a seemingly-endless churn followed by "The Webpage cannot be Displayed". This amazingly frustrating experience was followed, 12 hours later, by the discovery that Pottermore had charged my card.<br /><br />Okay, I thought, maybe the purchase went through and the site just glitched. Yay! I can get my e-Hogwarts after all! But no, Pottermore says that I have nothing in "My Books" and "My Orders" says that I never made a purchase. In other words, to add (financial) injury to insult (or at least aggravation), they took my money and gave me no book.<br /><br />I have no idea what business decision drove Scholastic and Rowlings to build Pottermore, nor what e-commerce newbies they chose to build it. I only hope that they will eventually come to their senses and sell through Amazon, a company with the ability and experience to actually fulfill eBook orders (and customer expectations). Until that time, I will content myself with my tattered paper copies when I need a wizarding fix.
