LOVED THE FIRST TWO BOOKS!! Couldn't hardly put them down. This one was NOTHING like them.<br /><br />Spoiler alert!<br /><br />Most of the book was pointless! They went through and the whole capital and got tons of there crew killed for nothing!! they didn't even get to the capial center before the rebels got there then they didn't even make it to the mansion before she got hurt. I felt like I had read that whole section for nothing!! When Prim died I didn't even get that she died. I had to read it over and over. Still don't get it really. Not until later on when she goes over it again. It all felt really rushed. Like she just wanted it to be over. "The war is over......blah, blah, blah, and now she only has peter so she loves him. the end. oh yea....she has 2 kids." I just feel unfinished. That's just too bad....Maybe they will make it into a movie and they will fix it then.
