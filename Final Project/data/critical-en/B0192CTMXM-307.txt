This is the last Harry Potter book I plan to buy.  I was thrilled with books 1 & 3, and I enjoyed books 2 & 4 almost as much.  But in learning to develop her writing style, J.K. has turned a light-hearted, fun-to-read series into an adult melo-drama that seems to explore HER frustrations rather than engage me in the delight of reading about the adventures of Harry and friends.  The latest book was almost humorless and definitely not an enjoyable read.  My nephews have never finished the book...they stopped less than 1/3 the way in the book because it "wasn't fun to read."  I agree.  With Harry showing little respect to Dumbledore towards the end of the book, I'm not sure I would WANT my nephews to finish the book.
