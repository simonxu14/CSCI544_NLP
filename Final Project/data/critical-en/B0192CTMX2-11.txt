This is my third of the audiobooks. i love the stories, but the CDs don't seem to play in my system very well.  they keep skipping and spinning - I hope this one works better than the last two<br />My least favorite of all the 7 books, i is difficult to listen to this without cringing and wincing and getting morose about how life sometimes is just not fair.  JK R is a great writer to be able to make the reader feel just how it felt to the character.
