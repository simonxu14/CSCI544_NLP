Like its predecessor, Goblet, Phoenix should have been cut down a bit. There is far too much of the Order sneaking around and Harry and the crew trying to figure out what is happening.Rowling does a great job showing Harry as a less than happy teen (Considering what he's been through, it's amazing he's as well adjusted as he is) and the rest of the crew mill about smartly but it is just too much standing around and waiting for things to happen, page after page.The snappy finale almost makes up for it and that's all I'll say about that.Potter continues to be one of the great creations of fantasy, but like Steven King, J.K. Rowling could use a bit of the philosophy "Less is More."
