I was not a fan of the third book.  I didn't read the first 2, I watched the movie.  I didn't feel like waiting for the next movie to come out, so I read the 3rd book in advance.  I thought the writing was poor.  The book was all over the place.  There didn't seem to be a cohesive flow to the story line.  I also thought the story-line lacked any real substance.  A disappointing end.  Here's to hoping the movie doesn't follow the same tragic ending.
