I found this whole series of Hunger Games books to be a bit repetitive. The series is entertaining and a fun and easy read. I was however a bit shocked to read that Ms. Collins' father was all about peace, ant-war, and she wrote these books to help support the idea of peace. Additionally, it appears her target audience is the teen population, hence Katniss's age.<br /><br />I find these books to be pretty violent and full of death, not to mention completely unrealistic. If real life human beings had gone through even just a small amount of the trauma these characters experienced even in one of these three books, they would be mired in the world of PTSD, not to mention traumatic brain injury issues. I just sort of find it pretty ironic that author claims to have been writing to support peace, yet it appears that one can go to war, suffer greatly, and then come out on the other side to have fulfilling relationships albeit some nightmares. This is not really the message of peace, non-violence, anti-war to me. Perhaps including some technology that could remove the impact of the trauma would have solved this dilemma for me or perhaps making Katniss end up in an aslyum of sorts would have worked.<br /><br />Anyway, go ahead and read it and pretend you are the winner here.
