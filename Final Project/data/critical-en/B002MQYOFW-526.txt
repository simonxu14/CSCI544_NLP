First of all,  don't get me wrong,  I loved this book. But there is a reason I gave it only 3 stars. While I adored Katniss' admiration I couldn't help myself from wanting to slap her sometimes as well. She is so ignorant until about 98 percent of the book about Peeta actually being in love with her. Like come on,  really? It was kind of cute at first,  but as the book went on it got a tad annoying. I kind of figured Collins does it on purpose and maybe I'll think differently after reading Catching Fire and Mockingjay. Thank god I didn't read this right when it came out and have to wait to start Catching Fire because I was more than dissapointed with the ending. Peeta's justifiably upset and Katniss wishes things were different. While some reviewers found Katniss unrelatable I found her more relatable than ever in this moment. Being so utterly confused and wishing things were different,  being in a love triangle. I just really wish it didn't end like that,  to me it was a weak ending. Also I could not get over how much this novel reminded me of Lord of the Flies. The thought came into my mind several times throughout this book. Hopefully Catching Fire and Mockingjay blow all my doubts out of the water because I truly did enjoy this fast paced,  riveting book.
