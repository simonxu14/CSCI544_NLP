I delayed reading the book because I thought the story had been worn thin and had evolved too slowly. Then I decided I should finish the trilogy. The plot is more interesting than I had expected, and I was glad that the book revealed how the evil of the games and the domination of human will retards the normal development of good people.Collins is good at making situations seem real.
