I loved, LOVED the first two. Brutal and so engaging. So I waited in high anticipation for the third and final in the series.<br /><br />But, I didn't love it. It was not the love triangle, or that she ended up with one boy over another.<br /><br />It was unemotional to me. I was *so* wrapped up in the characters in the first two, and was just apathetic in the last. Prim's death could have wrenched some real emotion, but she was such an undeveloped character that I hardly blinked.<br /><br />A lot of it, on the whole, just felt so unbelievable. I didn't hate it, and will continue to recommend the series, but I wish I had loved it like the first two.
