I decided to read this book based on the numerous rave reviews this book had been getting and the overall rating across the book shelves this book had. But I am left wondering why is it liked so much?<br /><br />Let me be clear first to say that the book has an interesting plot, good setup and engrossing pages in between. But overall, I felt let down. It left me wanting more. One key reason for that is the characters are just not allowed to grow to connect. So whatever the pages read, feels contrived. Even the twists, only a few, are forced, are deus ex machina. They are convenient for the writer. Didn't go well with me as a reader. And it is unnecessarily hurried at places, without much background or reason.<br /><br />It is not a bad novel, but I just feel it is an opportunity lost. This could have been so much better with a bit more focus on building the characters and trapping their emotions. Controlling the urge to drag the plot on violent action every time wouldn't have hurt.
