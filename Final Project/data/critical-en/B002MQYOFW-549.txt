This is by far my least favorite book of the series.  In fact, I think you could even do without this book and still enjoy the series.  Without going into details that will spoil the events contained within the book, I will simply state the following:<br />1)  the book seems rushed; there is far too much narration for my liking and the author skirts over large chunks of time on many occasions.  The timeline could have easily been condensed, and large portions of the book could have been removed in favor of elaborating on more important sections.<br />2)  along the same lines as point two, the writing often seems disjointed and can be difficult to follow.<br />3)  many of the &#34;negative events&#34; were unnecessary to the message of the book - the authors ending &#34;message&#34; could have been delivered quite as effectively without these occurrences.<br />4)  the relationship development/&#34;re-development&#34; between the characters was lacking.<br /><br />All in all, although I was fairly satisfied with the conclusion, the author's journey there seemed hasty -- which left me feeling dissatisfied with the book overall.
