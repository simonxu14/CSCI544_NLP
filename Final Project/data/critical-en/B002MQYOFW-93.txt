I loved the first two books in the series and I was so excited to see how the story was wrapped up in this book.<br />Now that I have finished it, I feel a little disappointed. Not because of how the story ended - I enjoyed all the twists and turns and the ending - but just disappointed in the book in general.<br /><br />I found the story to be extremely slow in some parts, making me just flick through them without reading properly so I could get back to the action and move along. I felt as though too much detail and too many pages were devoted to too many insignificant fluffy details, whilst some of the main events were just summed up and glossed over in a mere paragraph.<br /><br />I could not relate to Katniss in this book. Not at all. She was never one of my favourite characters in the first two books, but in this one she really annoyed me and I just wanted to shake her half the time.<br />Peeta was one of my favourites in the first two books. In this one though, to me, it felt like the author didnt know where to take his story line / character so took an easy option. Same with the ending.<br /><br />I'm glad I've finished with this trilogy. I had to keep reading to find out what happened, but I found the book on a whole to be fairly unpolished and rushed for the most part.
