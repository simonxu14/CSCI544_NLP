I was really looking forward to this book because I thought finally Rowling would give some resolution to all the bad that Harry has been through.  Instead she could have cut the book in half, she kills off three of the more interesting and vital characters right at the end  without literary justification, we never know what happens to Luna, and the way Harry defeats Voldemort and comes back from the dead is convoluted and definitely needed a rewrite.  Finally the closing seemed too "cheery" and cut and dried for the rest of the series, like the author didn't know what to do.  I realize that this is a children's book, but the darkness and reality of the series (e.g., the sheer number of people Harry losses) puts it in the league with adult fiction and is what makes it interesting, though a bit depressing.  I would say, read it just because, but in my mind, the series ended with Book 6.
