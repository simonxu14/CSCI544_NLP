I feel like the end of this series is so anti-climactic. I hate where it leaves all of the victors. it j y st feels like Ms. Collins gave up and did what was expected. I'm disappointed in this book and expected more from the characters I've come to know. None of them acted much like the characters they evolved into through the first two books. their actions didn't match up with their growth. so much potential and it just fell flat for me.
