A great start to a forgettable story.  The first book promised a good story with a fantastic blend of happiness, sorrow, triumph and promise.  The second flat-lined and only kept me interested in characters I hoped would grow.  The third? It abandoned all hope of being anything more than a less than mediocre story of teenage loss. Avoid the books and avoid the coming movies.  The first is best, the second carries, the third and final is nothing.  Let it be relegated to the same literary and cinematic hell of Twilight, money earned be damned.
