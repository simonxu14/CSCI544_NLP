Good story but quite poorly written. At times I felt as though I was reading a creative writing assignment from junior high student. I am no novelist so this is reviewed as a theatergoer reviewing a director's film. For such a widely celebrated book I thought the structure any portion of the writing would be more mature. A book for tweens can still be written well and says a lot about the expectations of authors towards their readers or the lack of talent of the writers. Some parts are better than others. At certain points I become unbearably aggravated by the dull sentence structure which makes if difficult to finish the book; one can tell where the author has difficulty. I'd recommend finding the first chapter online before purchasing or just holding out for the movie, I doubt that much detail will be left out. Here's a passage out of the first chapter to give you an idea:<br />"'Hey, Catnip,' says Gale. My real name is Katniss, but when I first told hm, I had barely whispered it. So he thought I'd said Catnip. Then When This crazy lynx started following me around the woods looking for handouts, it became his official nickname for me. I finally had to kill the lynx because he scared off game. I almost regretted it because he wasn't bad company, But I got a decent price for his pelt."<br />That wasn't the worst of it but was the first page I flipped to while writing this review.
