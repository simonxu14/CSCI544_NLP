I was obssed read all 3 books the way Collins let gale out of the picture was just horrible it makes me thing she was told what to do or given a very tight timeline to finish this book. Katniss does not portray her Helf instead she is this numb still living human being. I hope they redo it or come up with a 3rd book not that I expected a fairy tale ending but c'mon
