I did not expect this book to be a bloodbath.  That killing your fellow man for entertainment of others.  Of course, this was done in centuries past, but this seemed to be futuristic, which is scary to think about.  I knew who would win, it was t he how that made me continue to read.  I surly will stop with this book.  No more Hunger Games for me.  Sorry.
