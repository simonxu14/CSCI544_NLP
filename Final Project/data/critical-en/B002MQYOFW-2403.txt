I wasn't liking the book in general, it was going to slow for me at some parts and it was just WAY too depressing for me, seeing Katniss's world through her prospective while everything was crashing down around her. Too many people were dying, too many tears were shed. It's not something I want to read during my stressful life. When I finished the book, I was madder than I ever have been. I hated how the book ended, I hated the story. The first two books were absolutley amazing, but i have to say Suzanne Collins murdered the entire series with that book.
