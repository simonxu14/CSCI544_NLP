I bought this book because some of my 40 something girlfriends were discussing it and how much they liked it and couldn't wait for the movie!<br />I am usually not a fan of this type of story, preferring thriller/crime/suspense.<br />I felt it was written with teenagers in mind, kind of like the recent Twilight series and Harry Potter.<br />I didn't enjoy the story as I felt I needed more of a description of what had gone before to arrive at the point of the story, it felt rushed.<br />I bought the Movie Tie In Edition by mistake and am not sure whether there is a different book, written differently.<br />Needless to say, I have not finished it and probably won't bother.
