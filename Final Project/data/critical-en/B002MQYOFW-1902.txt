I admit it, I officially don't get why this book series is getting such good reviews. All I can think of is that it is one of those books that has become 'trendy' to say you have read and you loved. I have just finished the series and can only say it was ok, certainly not great.<br /><br />I'm glad I got this 3 pack too as the first book was awful! The writing was poor, you could see the plot lines coming from a mile off and to be honest there would have been no way I would have read the second. The second book starts off in much the same manner but does improve towards the end. Even then though the plot is do blindingly obvious, you are reading it really to see if you are right rather than because you want to know what happens!<br /><br />In the last book you can again see the result of the war from a long way off but there are a few surprises that make it worth reading. The writing also improved.<br /><br />I guess as a summary I am disappointed this wasn't so much more. Yes it's worth reading, but don't expect a lot of it. Stick with it to the final book if you want to get it at it's best too. I'm not sure if this means I'm recommending it or not! This isn't a book I'll want to reread or will think about now I've finished it. So I guess I would say find something better, but if you're really struggling then give it a go.
