The action in the book was pretty mediocre. However I felt that there were some profound statements and moments that spoke to man kind in general and that have stuck with me since finishing the book. Initially I was upset but as I reflected upon what had to take place and the manner in which the author brought it together I could appreciate the trilogy as a whole.
