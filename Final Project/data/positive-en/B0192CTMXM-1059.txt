The book & series could have ended without the Epilogue, which tarnishes the abundant creativity in the rest of the books. The only thing missing from it is having all the characters who died, smiling and waving as the scene fades to sappy music. Does Ms. Rowling feel that her true audience are children who cannot understand anything other than a stereotyped fairytale ending?<br /><br />If you haven't yet read this book, skip the Epilogue. You won't miss anything.
