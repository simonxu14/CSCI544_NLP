It is really hard to pick which one of the books is my favorite, it just seems impossible. J.K. Rowling does it again and produces another classic installment of the enchanting harry potter series. The order of pheonix is by far the darkest book in this series, and is in my opinion again by far the funniest!!! yes you will not be able to supress your laughter as it is amazingly funnier than all the previous four books put together.<br />1. The storyline:<br />  the story is wonderous. For the first time in this intreguing series we have a story that depends heavily on previous events from the four books. Rowling gives hints about things somebody said or did in the previous books that have a deep effect in the fifth. She never gives you what it is though, you'll have to go back to the previous books and read that particular chapter in order to find what it was. The twists and turns are simply unpredictable. You can keep guessing through out reading this book but you'll rarely or never get the right answers!!! also you get alot of answers for quetions you've always wanted to ask.<br />2.The charecters:<br /> Rowling's children actually grow up in this book. They're really changing. Harry is angrier, Hermione actually loosens up a bit and Ron's Baby sister Ginney has a bigger role her (more stronger and independent). Ron however is simply the same (which i think is wonderful). You also meet new charecters that are really well presented you'll feel that you actually know them personally. Keep an eye for Luna Lovegood(charming).<br />3. Villains:<br /> Frightening, every one of them had ahd a previous appearance in other harry potter books, but here they're more active and you'll hate them. Well described and set to fit this amazing story.<br />4. The ending is sooooooooo much better than any of the previous endings. You here have real answers and not mere hints. You'll be taken back to before Harry was born and you'll love it!!!<br />I'm 21 and I read alot of books (mainly fiction by Dickens and Austen) yet this book managed to sweep me off my feet!!! I wasn't able to put it down. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
