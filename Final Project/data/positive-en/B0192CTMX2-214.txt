This series is, of course, great! This is the second time I have read them and, this time around, I decided to download the audiobook as well as the ebook.  Sometimes I would simply listen to the story while others I would follow along with the recording. I HIGHLY recommend this, as I felt I comprehended more by doing so.  Beyond that, the gentleman who read it, Jim Dale, has amazing storytelling abilities represented by his multiple voices and calm tone. Great story, even better to listen to.  I will be downloading both the ebook and audiobook for the 6th and 7th books in the series.
