J.K. Rowling once again brings freshness and humor to the Harry Potter series.  Book No. 4 is a gem, and to my mind, even better than the Chamber of Secrets and the Prisoner of Azkeban.  The story is beautifully plotted, uses all kinds of new magical devices (while finding new angles to old  ones) and introduces a slew of wonderfully developed and clever characters  that one hopes will keep cropping up in later books. The 734 pages are  anything but daunting; I could have read twice as much and still not have  gotten enough.  I don't want to give any of the plot away so suffice it to  say, don't miss this one!
