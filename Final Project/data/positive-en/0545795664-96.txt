This is such a great gift to give a child that's into Pokemon, or anyone else that has rediscovered a love for Pokemon (pokemon Go)! The book is a great value, considering all the pages are colored and the book itself is very thick. I got this for my five year old nephew and he LOVES it! He memorized the majority of the names, and even knows what &#34;type&#34; of pokemon they are. Highly recommend
