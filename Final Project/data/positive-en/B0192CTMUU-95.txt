I've just spent the day reading Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire--now how long til Book 4?<br />Harry seems to be growing up, and I thought all the main characters were much more interesting and complicated in this book  than they have been.  I suppose there's quite a lot of difference between  11 and 14.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione are still entirely likeable, and there  are some important changes in their relationships brewing.  Many new  characters are introduced here as well, and obviously many of them will be  recurring characters in Harry's last years at Hogwarts.  I was particularly  interested in what happened with Snape!<br />The book is tightly plotted, and  very intense.  I wouldn't recommend it for young readers--if you thought  the dementors were scary, wait until the end of this book!  But it's  definitely up to the hype, and will have readers waiting for the next  installment.
