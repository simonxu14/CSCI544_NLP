I was worried that with all the success of the series, and the fact that this book was written in less time than the others, that The Goblet Of Fire wouldn't be as good.  Wrong.  The 4th book may be my favorite one!  It's nearly twice as long as the others, with all the favorite characters from  the first, and even more.  The International Quiddich Cup and the Triwizard  Tournomant would seem to be wonderful things for any other young wizard,  but when you're Harry Potter, nothing is ever as it should be.  More of  You-Know-Who's supporters are lurking, but Harry has his friends, Sirius,  and the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor on his side.  Even more  mysteries abound, and once again, who is friend and who is foe will  surprise you.  Don't want to give too much away, but it's difinately a  must-read, for Harry Potter fans and everyone else!
