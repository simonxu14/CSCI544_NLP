Second year of Hogwarts, and we are learning more and more about Harry's back story. Mrs. Weasley was a standout in this novel for me. Making breakfast for her children, and Harry all while scolding her boys and giving Harry extra helpings was so comical to me. Harry learning he knows Parseltongue was an a-ha moment, and going into the chamber to save Ginny was wondeful. I feel like I should watch the movies after I read each book. I am having so much fun being in Potter world.
