This long-awaited fifth installment of the HP story adds additional depth and complexity to many of the main characters, bringing faults and histories to the surface to complement their struggles and virtues.  "Goblet of Fire" (Book 4) had a more direct story line with the linear elements of the Triwizard Tournament, but "Order of the Phoenix" (Book 5) has vivid visual events and new aspects of more involved relationships.  Harry, Dumbledore, Sirius, and other main characters aren't as perfect and the answers aren't as clean.  My only qualm is that there isn't as much complexity in He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's game plan as I would have expected so far...but it does leave me looking forward to Book 6....and to continued debates with my 7 and 9 year olds about their perspectives on the world of HP.  This continues to be a series of books to bring together the whole family. (So I'm glad I bought two copies, or I would be waiting a month to get my turn!)
