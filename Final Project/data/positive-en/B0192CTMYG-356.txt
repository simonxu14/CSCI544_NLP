I have purchased copies of this book for four grandchildren, boys and girls.  They all love it and have read it several times.  They could hardly wait for the other two books to be published.  In this day and age of  computers, tv, videos, etc., it is wonderful to see and hear of the  excitement that this book creates.  There is nothing like your own  imagination that is developed by reading.  I loved the book as well.  We  have been to the authors book signing and I would say she is the premier  author of this century as she has done what no one else could do....bring  kids back to the joy of reading!!
