I've read the first three Potter books and I've seen all of the films, but I have to say that "Prisoner of Azkaban" is the best of the lot.  This book, in my opinion, develops all of the key characters to a degree better than the two previous tales.  The reader also begins to notice how age is beginning to affect young Harry.  He is slowly becoming a moody teenager, and this is most evident in the early portions of the book when he uses magic in the Muggle world.  Hermione and Ron are also developing into more mature young adults.  They bicker and squabble like brother and sister(or is it boyfriend and girlfriend?).<br /><br />We are also introduced to some key characters in Potter lore.  Most important are Sirius Black, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew.  Without giving too much away for those who haven't read the book or viewed the flicks, just know that these three characters are pivotal to this particular book AND future volumes.  We also catch a glimpse of characters like Cedric Diggory, Professor Trelawney, and Cho Chang.<br /><br />Not only are we introduced to some new characters, but we get to catch up with the likes of Draco Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, Seamus Finnigan, Percy, Fred and George, and the clueless Neville Longbottom.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with this book, it tells the story of Harry's third year at Hogwart's.  Naturally, trouble is a-brewing and it is centered around Harry.  It seems that the murderous Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban prison, a first in the wizarding world.  He seems to be intent on finishing what Voldemort started, which is to kill Harry.  As the story unfolds, things become rather interesting and culminate in the best Potter climax that I've read so far.<br /><br />Once again, I have to throw in that all of the Potter books are wonderful for youngsters to read.  They are full of adventure and wonder that any young mind can easily digest.  These stories let kids be kids, and fire their imaginations into creating their own adventures.  Harry ISN'T satanic, nor does he lead children into the world of magic.  As long as parents tend to their children properly, there won't be any problems.  Do be advised that as Harry grows, his adventures become more precarious and deal with young adult themes, so I would try to stay at least one book ahead of my child in reading these stories.  My daughter isn't quite old enough to read these stories, but she has seen all of the films.  However, she is not allowed to watch all of the "Goblet of Fire" film, and if you've seen it, you know why.<br /><br />Highly recommended book for youngsters and oldsters alike.
