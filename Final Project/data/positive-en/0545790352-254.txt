This book feels like one to keep forever and pass down to your children's children.  The illustrations are imaginatively conceived and lushly rendered.  When I received this, I immediately flipped through to see every one.  There are also some delightful additions of substantive content through the illustrations of trolls and dragon eggs.  The best part has been reading it to my 7 year old though.  As the younger sibling of a huge Harry Potter fan (his sister read and re-read the series 6 times in a year), he had seen all the movies by the time he was 6, but expressed no interest in reading or listening the books, despite several attempts.  (This is also a child who does not remember life before the iPad.)  But he is so captivated by the illustrations, he wants me to read to him every night.  He has gone from &#34;why are there so many details?&#34; to &#34;this is so much better than the movies,&#34; and best of all, &#34;Mom, whenever I am sad, please read this book to me.&#34;  What better recommendation could there be?  We can hardly wait for the rest of the series.
