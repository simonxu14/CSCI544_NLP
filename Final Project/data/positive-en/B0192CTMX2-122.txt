Probably the best of the Harry Potter series.  Once again, J.K. Rowling conjures up a very believable world in which magic is commonplace, fantastic creatures, e.g., Buckbeat, the hippogriff, and animagi, have important roles to play, and sheer, delightful inventions such as the Knight Bus enrich the reader's sheer appreciation of what the imaginative mind can bring forth and present for our entertainment.
