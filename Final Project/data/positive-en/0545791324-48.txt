WOW! Just wow! It exceeded my expectations.<br />I didn't know there was an illustrated version being printed of the Harry Potter books and preordered this one not expecting much. I now am itching to order Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Illustrated version, but have to wait til payday. Haha. I can't wait to have this full collection with the original series.<br />The illustrations are amazing! There are so much details, and gives the book so much life. Jim Kay did an amazing job at giving the book another perspective.<br />It's a must have for any Potter fans! You won't regret it.
