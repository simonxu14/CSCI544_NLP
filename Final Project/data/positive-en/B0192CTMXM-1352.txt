I've been waiting to read this ever since I began the series! I absolutely loved this book, & while I believe it to be the best of the series overall, I did have one or two problems with it.<br /><br />First, the pacing at the end was a little rushed. There were several important characters that died at the end & their deaths were hardly mentioned in the book. It was mostly a few brief paragraphs. I thought that the characters deserved more of a mention than a sentence or two. There were also plot points that would have been missed if I hadn't went back to re-read the last few pages.<br /><br />Second, not all of the revelations are as "stunning" as was promised by JK. While most were pretty gasp-worthy, many were just briefly brought up & given a half-hearted explanation. Again, I think that it could be explained by the rushed plot at times.<br /><br />I really wish that JK had made this series into 8 books instead of 7 (for each Hogwarts year). It would have given her more of a chance to expand some of the minor mysteries & storylines of HP. Overall, I loved the book & will make my remaining friends & family members who haven't read the series read it. I still wish that the last book had been fleshed out more.
