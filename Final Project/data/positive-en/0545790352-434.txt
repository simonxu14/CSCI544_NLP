This book was a great pick me up for my Harry Potter fan-boy nerdom. The illustrations are so gorgeous and well done, especially since J.K. Roweling herself commissioner them. And even if she doesn't like my views on life and politics, or we don't see eye to eye on many things. I still respect her and her story more than ever. If you're a true fan of Harry Potter, or just someone who wants to introduce the story to their kids, nephews, nieces, or even adults new to the story. Then, this version of HP will give you all that you need, plus a new way to visit the story of our beloved character. Take a chance, and start adding these amazing books to your collection today, before they run out!
