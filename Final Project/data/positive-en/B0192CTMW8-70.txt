J.K. Rowling continues with this follow-up and its more of the same: rich in story, character and setting, Chamber of Secrets sizzles. The Harry Potter world feels real...almost. I have only a few concerns that stop me from giving it the famed five stars. As in The Sorcerer's Stone, Rowling's world goes to far at times and then not far enough depending on where she wants to go with the story ,for example, magic can repair broken bones and not a broken brooms. And of course there's the flying car and angry tree at the beginning, a lot of fun, but I don't know whether to be scared or thrilled...probably both. Is Harry really ever in any danger? I mean, after all he is the chosen one isn't he?<br /><br />I will say that the movies do the novels absolutely no justice. The movies often seem like only excerpts from these vividly told stories.<br /><br />John Darryl Winston
