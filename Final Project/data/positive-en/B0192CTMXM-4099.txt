I was a little skeptical ordering a book online cause god knows the conditions it might show up in. But i was wrong, of course there were a few little spots i didn't pay much mind too. And like any paper back book after reading it the binding cover is a bit worn but that is to be expected. For the prices for such a popular book i just couldn't pass this one up. As for the story it was great,i wont mention details for those who want to read this. But it was such a wonderful way to end a series.
