J.K. Rowling writes in a way that lets your imagination flow.  Her words take you away, painting pictures in your mind.  Few books provide such satisfaction and it is disappointing that the series isn't continuing.  Her attention to detail completes the experience.  I was not a fan at first and thought that the books were for children but, aside from a few parts, the story appeals to all ages.  There is some teenage angst but we all have those feelings at some point even in our adult lives.  This review is written by a former skeptic, someone who let his guard down and gave the books a chance.  If you enjoy reading and using your imagination, you will enjoy these books.  Read something that you like, don't base all your selections on their literary merit.  These books will become classic, why should you wait until then, enjoy them now.
