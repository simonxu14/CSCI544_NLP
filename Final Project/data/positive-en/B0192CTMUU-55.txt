J.K. Rowling has truly written a gem in the Goblet of Fire.  In this book, Harry must face test after test, in which he not only proves himself to be a formidable wizard, but he learns a lot about his past, present, and future.<br />This book is darker than the first three books.  However, the dark parts do not really start until the last few chapters.  However, death and murder do play some large roles in this book.  I would not recommend this book for young children, since they may not completely understand the significance of death and the true violence of murder.  However, I believe children can read this book, if they understand more about some of the darker themes.<br />I gave this book 5 stars since I believe it to be a great piece of literature.  It is written well enough to keep both children and adults riveted to the book.  I have purchased hardbacks so that the books will last a long time and my children will be able to enjoy them as well.
