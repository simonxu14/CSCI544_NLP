One might think that after 4 books J.J Rowling would run out of ideas to subject her famous creation to. One might think the well has run dry.... you would think wrong.<br />Harrys fifth year is filled with wonderful friendships and terrible secrets. He must fight against the very world that he loves so much, and risk everything for what he believes. A new teacher enters Hogwarts and tests Harrys patience to the breaking point.<br />Despite the weight of the book, I found it to be a light and entertaining read, one which I flew through with no difficulty at all. I would recommend it to any Potter fan.
