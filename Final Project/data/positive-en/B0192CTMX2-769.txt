Thanks JK Rowling!!<br /><br />HARRY LIVES....or maybe not!!! ...inside of us, as do many of the characteristics, thoughts and actions of many of the characters including he who CAN be named...Voldemort! Maybe we can see ourselves better as a result of our journey with Ms Rowling's inescapable world of CONFLICTS AND FRIENDSHIPS.<br /><br />Does this book or the series really matter? that depends on each of us..... will we apply ourselves to risk and win and lose with our own lives? We all identify with Harry and DA members but what about the voldemort days we have? i have  shed tears of joy and sorrow while on this journey as i have in my own life now 54 years in passing.<br /><br />GOOD vs EVIL ...internal and external ....master vs slave....yes, i can relate to this struggle not only for myself but for my 21 nephews and nieces and for the thousands of Americans now serving our country overseas!<br /><br />will we be the same as before HP or apply the healing balm of love to the world we presently live in?<br /><br />DON'T BE OVERCOME WITH EVIL BUT OVERCOME EVIL WITH GOOD.....
