This book enchants with its amazing story every one already knows.  However, included in this edition is a cute hand drawn pic of Harry by J. K. herself!  Myself being a die hard fan loves the fact it's leather bound but still has some of the wonderful artistry of Mary GrandPre showing on the front.  Overall, it's an excellent purchase.
