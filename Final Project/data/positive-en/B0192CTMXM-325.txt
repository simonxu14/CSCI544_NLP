This last Potter book was great, but, at the same time there was something missing.  I have two hypothesis:<br />1. The three year wait and anticipation made us expect more than could be offered.<br />2. There was not as much blunt "action" in the Pheonix book & the description of the Dept. of Mysteries was average and not up to her creative abilities.  It was, no doubt, creative, but predictable creative, imaginings similar (I hate to say it) to my own imaginatio abilities.  And I love J.K. Rowling, so I hate saying all of this.<br />These books are amazing and have created a world I would love to  live in somehow.  Her characters are complex (the movies do them no justice at all) and the scenery is entrancing.<br />I will say, however, that I did have favorite parts: Umbridge was amazing (I hated HER, but she was a great character; I couldn't stop reading whenever she entered the page. Sirius was my favorite.  I had always imagined I was related to him.
