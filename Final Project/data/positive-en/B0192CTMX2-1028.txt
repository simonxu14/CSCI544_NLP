I won't comment on the plot of the story, everybody knows that this book have become favourite for all kids and not only around the world (including me). So that leaves me with the item as an item<br /><br />I live in Greece, but because I was impatient, I couldn't wait six months to be translated to Greece, so I bought it from here, when the book arrived, I never expected such book, it was hardcover and had this nice cover art-like of Harry Potter, I seriously loved the whole book exterior.<br /><br />As about the plot, what can someone say for Harry Potter? (Absolutely fascinating plot)
