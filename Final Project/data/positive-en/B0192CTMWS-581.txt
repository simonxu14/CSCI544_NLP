I couldn't wait to get my hands on the fifth installment of the Harry Potter series. Finally, the Saturday came and I was anxiously waiting for the FedEx feller to come and deliver my package...anywho, when I started reading it, the book immediately seized me into the plot. It felt as if I was actually there. I was seeing everything out of my own perspective. Of course, all the other Harry Potter books did that.<br /><br />I thought it started off rather interesting and the climax of the story was great. the Order of the Phoenix was filled with suspense, teary moment and more humor than in previous books. I have to admit, there were some parts in the book were I had misty eyes. Compared to the other 4 books, I would have to rank this under GoF because the fourth book was definitely my favorite. There were some minor disappointments, only because I had high-expectations when plunging into this book, but like I said, they were just minor setbacks (and i mean microscopical). Ex: there were some holes left unfilled by the end of the book. I think she might've forgotten to explain a few tiny things, but that's ok.<br /><br />Overall this book was great. As i was reading along, I knew I wasn't going to be satisfied until I had completely finished the whole book. However in the end, I felt a tad bit empty...but I still can't wait until she releases the 6th book, which I hope will be very very soon. If you enjoyed this book as much as I did (which is a lot) you can count of wanting to read it more than once. I know I do.<br /> Until Harry turns 16...maybe we don't have to wait a few years for Ms.Rowling to finish...
