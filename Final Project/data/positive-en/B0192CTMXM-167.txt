I've read this book two or three times now.  Depending upon your definition of 'read'.  The first time, I was a little disappointed, but after thinking about the previous books and rereading this book, I got over it.<br /><br />HP and the Deathly Hallows is awesome.  Yes, it plods along, but there is nothing there that can be cut.  And the action is as intense as any I've ever seen.<br /><br />Character development has, in my opinion, always been JKR's strongest suit.  And in this book Harry, Ron, and Hermione grow up.  Especially Harry.  In the beginning of the book he is a boy, but the end he has become a man.  This transformation takes place both gradually, and in leaps and bounds.  I'd give examples and details but I don't want to spoil things for those who have not read this book.<br /><br />I like how JKR handles the love story.  Harry's love for Ginny and Ron and Hermione's love for each other is always there, but there is nothing sappy about it.  Its a subtle thing of glances and actions and descriptions, with just a touch of dialogue.<br /><br />I also liked how JKR handled the life and death struggle.  There are several deaths in this book.  But there is nothing gratitious about them.  Nor is there anything trite.  Each is sad in its own way.  I only saw one of them coming.<br /><br />I do wish that we had seen more of certain characters.  I think the book would have benefitted from the Trio seeking outside help a little more often.  But other than that, I loved this book.
