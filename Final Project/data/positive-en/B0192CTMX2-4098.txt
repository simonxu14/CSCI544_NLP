Lots of action from the get-go; a real page-turner.  Some characters are fleshed out in a more satisfying way; no spoilers here about who that might be.  Let's just say that not everyone is as they appear.<br /><br />Only one negative, really; the story rambles a fair bit before coming to what feels like a rapid and perhaps too neat conclusion.  I would've preferred the great revelations at the end to have been more nuanced and spaced out in the story itself.  But that's a minor quibble.  Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable story from beginning to end.
