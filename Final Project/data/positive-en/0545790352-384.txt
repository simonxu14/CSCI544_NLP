Just received our copy in the mail and I was so happy with my purchase.  First off, it was bigger than I expected which was awesome for viewing the artwork throughout the book.  It was great to see the artist used their imagination for how they thought the characters looked.  While some resemble the cast of the movie, you can tell that that the artist used his own vision.  The book is very well made and just fun to look through even when you're not reading it, especially if you've read it before.  I would highly recommend this item for a gift to any Harry Potter fans out there.  I will definitely get on the waiting list for the second one.
