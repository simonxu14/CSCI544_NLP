Audiobooks are much more convenient for me than books since I work long hours and commute almost 2 hours a day. I love the Harry Potter series and received this audiobook right before I finished &#34; The Prisoner Of Azkeban&#34;, so I was able to transition from one to the next without a gap. I am a happy camper!
