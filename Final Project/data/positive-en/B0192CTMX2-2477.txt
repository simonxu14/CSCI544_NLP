J.K. Rowling did it again!  This has to be my favorite book in the series.  I think she wrapped up her story lines well and there was a great amount of excitement and suspense.  I was very upset to have to put the book down for anything.  I feel that the drama and the scale of the different battles in the book lived up to my hopes for a grand finale. The characters seem to be friends that I will be sad not to read more about!  It doesn't seem possible for the movie to even come close to living up to the book!
