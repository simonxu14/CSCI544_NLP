An absolute inventory of emotions.  Proof that the tragedy of life is part of what makes it so sweet.  This book kept me turning pages deep into the night. JK Rowling is a genious.  If you haven't read the others, don't even try to start here.  Try book one; if it doesn't get you hooked there is no point in moving on... you have no imagination.
