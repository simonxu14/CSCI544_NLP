Actually, my 17 year-old dauughter purchased this as a birthday gift for her 18 year-old friend who had never read any of the Harry Potter books.  Both of my kids have read - and re-read - all of the Harry Potter books and we have all seen ALL of the movies.  I read part of this book (sorry, I just needed to see how it all ends!) and I loved it, too.  My kids say the books are even better and much more detailed than the movies, and when we see the movies, my daughter explains things to me from the books to give me a better understanding of what is going on in the movies, so we highly recommend the books, especially the first one and this last one!
