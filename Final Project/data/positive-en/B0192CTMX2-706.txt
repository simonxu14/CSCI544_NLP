Wonderful, if extremely heavy. I raced through it, finishing in the early morning hours and now am left to wonder when the next installment comes out.<br />Book five in the Harry Potter series well lives up to its predecesors. Harry has grown up as a result of the events in Goblet of Fire and is angry, and quite obviously teenaged throughout this book. Rowling maintains the vivid description and sly sense of humor  that characterize the early books.<br />One caveat, I would definitely reccommend that parents of younger childeren give this one a read through before allowing their children to read it. There is no swearing and nothing remotely sexual in content but the book itself is fairly dark. The ending contains a surprise which may be shocking and highly upsetting for some younger children. I would say that if you have children under 12 you might want to read this with them as a family effort.<br />The book itself is absolutely wonderful. Harry races through his 5th year, facing upcoming OWLS, a Hogwarts community with doubts about his sanity, a wizarding world which doubts the return of Voldemort and the worst Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher yet. A must read.
