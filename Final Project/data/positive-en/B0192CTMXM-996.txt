...and as those of us who have walked that path know, it is sometimes a bit bumpy.  This is a superb book in terms of both evolving Harry (many of the characters, actaully) and the whole series. JKR does a great job of capturing the trials, tribulations, doubts, and passions of growing up in a way that easily moves the plot forward.  And a great plot at that--action, intrugue, heros, villians--there is not a lot of dead space in its 900 pages. The book is also a great "middle book"--answers some questions, set a couple of more hooks and generally keeps things fresh--JKR has done a good job in avoiding the cookie-cutter syndrome.
