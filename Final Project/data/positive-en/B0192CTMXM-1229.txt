OK, I admit it. I love the Harry Potter series. Probably even more than my kids. This is a great conclusion to the series. Great examination of relationships between maturing kids in difficult circumstances. Rowling finishes both the 'coming-of-age' story and the good vs. evil saga that have carried the series forward. Masterful writing.<br /><br />I can't wait for the movie!
