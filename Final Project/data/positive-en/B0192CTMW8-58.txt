This is not the best of the Harry Potter series, but it is certainly a wildly entertaining and fast read. It is a must read to continue on to the Prisoner of Azkaban and the Goblet of Fire, which are both excellent along with the remainder of the series. The movies are also good, but they never do the books full justice.
