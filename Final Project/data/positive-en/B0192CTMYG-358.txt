I've read this for the second time amazed by how much I didn't remember.  This book and the movie are very similar.  The beginning of this book sets up a reader needing to read more of it.  From the start I was a Harry Potter fan.  As Harry is introduced to the wizarding world I found myself wishing I was in Diagon Alley buying my magical school supplies preparing to head off to a whole new world.  Each character is drawn out to the readed nicely.  No reader, any age, would have trouble imagining this world and all the adventures Harry has.  This is defiantly a book I will read more than twice.
