Harry version 5 is a good book but just too long. The book was excellently written but nothing really happens for long stretches and you get the picture early on that Harry is upset etc etc. I waited anxiously to read the book and was not terribly disappointed by any means..it just could have been a bit shorter...<br />That said..I cannot wait for 6....
