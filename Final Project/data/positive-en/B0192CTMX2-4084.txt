What more could one possibly say about Harry Potter and J. K. Rowling?  The books are delightful, pure entertainment for intelligent children and adults.  That alone is remarkable.  If anyone sees evil in Harry Potter, that person has a serious personality flaw in my view.  We read fiction for fun, for the magic of it, no matter how intellectual we may get in describing a work.  If it ain't fun, if it doesn't transport us, then it ain't worth it.  Harry Potter is fun.<br />I hesitate to add that the latest installment is perhaps a bit too long by some 200 pages.  A good editor could have fixed that easily.  It took too long to get to Hogwarts, where I long to be.  I tolerate the other places.  Other than that, I loved it.
