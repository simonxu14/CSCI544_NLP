Well, this is by far the best of the books in the series for me. The last 10 chapters were very difficult to tear myself away from. The entire series was well constructed and all the clues to how things must turn out are there, but you'd have to be pretty crafty to pick up on them. My only complaint is in not knowing what ever became of Luna Lovegood as she was one of my favorite characters.<br />In my opinion formed by over 50 years of reading, Rowling is throughout this series, a competent writer, but not a great one, which is sad, because the story itself is a very good one and could have been an even more amazing read had it been done with more skill. There were many moments that I felt like I was "reading a book" rather than transported to a magical world. Her skill certainly improves with each book, and if I could rewrite history, I'd have her write about 10 novels to improve her craft before setting out on this series. But, we live in the real world. There are no wands, giants, centaurs, witches, wizards and things that exist just because you can't prove that they don't. There is magic in storytelling however, and I'd give Rowling an A+ on her efforts.<br />This series is available in excellently read audiobook format and there are the 8 movies, both of which I intend to consume next. Most interestingly, there is a website (http://hpmor.com/) that teaches philosophy using characters (including Harry) and settings from the Potterverse. It's an ongoing project and when it's done, I plan on reading it; mostly because a vast majority of its readers claim that it's much better written than the J K Rowling series.<br />I give my undying thanks and love to Tara Hale for convincing me to read the entire series when everyone else had failed to overcome my objection to the fact that Harry never farts and laughs anywhere in the saga. He may be the boy who lived, but how he could have done so without ever farting is the greatest magic of all.
