Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is book four in the Harry Potter series.  I consider it one of the best books.  Harry, Hermione and Ron are growing up and the adventure is becoming more intense.<br /><br />For Kids?<br /><br />This is a big debate in the Harry Potter world.  I have an 8 year old daughter who just finished reading this book.  Granted, she is an advanced reader - but she came away with a good grasp on the themes and story line.<br /><br />Have fun reading this great book and feel free to share it with a friend (maybe even a young one!)
