If youre  Harry Potter fans like we are, an audiobook is great for long car trips.  We read the books so fast, an audiobook lets us pause and talk about whats going on in the story.  Now looking back we hear so many clues of things to come.  You get to appreciate JK rowling's brilliance and see how things build to the climatic last book.
