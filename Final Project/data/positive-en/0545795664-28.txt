I bought this book for my 7 year old daughter who is engulfed in the reinvigorated Pokemon phenomena.  She loves it. Its 432 pages of brightly colored, easy to read and fun Pokemon info which keeps here busy and more importantly, READING. I even found her older brother helping her look up and read up on the characters they did not know about or rare versions. All the characters are listed alphabetically for easy reference and the book is manufactured in what seems to be high quality paper and bound nicely. A+++
