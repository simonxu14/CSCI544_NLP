Ok. I read this book in one sitting. I have read all of the Harry Potter books first to myself and then to my 2 kids. I was supposed to not read this by myself, I was supposed to wait and read it to my kids little by little at bedtime, but I couldn't help myself. I had to read it, and actually, I read it twice to myself, and we are now 3/4 of the way through my reading it aloud to my kids.<br /><br />If you have not read any of the Harry Potter books, you should first go back and get book 1 and read all of the books in the series before you read this one, and you should buy every single book in the series because you will want to go back and read them again.<br /><br />J.K. Rowling is an amazing storyteller and she ended the series in an excellent way. I will not give it away, so you will have to read it.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed. Go out and buy it now.
