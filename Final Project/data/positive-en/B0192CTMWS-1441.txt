Giving this 4 stars is fair only when comparing the book against its predecessors.  There is no comparison to what Ms. Rowling is doing with this series.  This book is outstanding, as are all in the series.  I have nits, discussed below, but the series, book by book and as a series, compares favorably with the only other 7-book series of any significance, The Chronicles of Narnia.  Head to head, only The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe and The Voyages of Prince Caspian can stand up to any one of the Potter series.<br />That said, my only complaint is that Harry's mood -- teen angst tempered by outbursts of anger -- needed more modulating to stand out for contrast.  The book took on a kind of tension because Harry was always in a fit, never relaxed.  Granted, he has a lot going against a relaxing life, but it got to the point where I suspected that the plot would reveal that he was being influenced by the herb mentioned in middle of the book that causes people to lose their tempers.<br />Otherwise, the plot was busy but not overly so (I can only imagine, however, what a chore it will be to film this in less than three hours).  An excellent way to spend a weeekend.
