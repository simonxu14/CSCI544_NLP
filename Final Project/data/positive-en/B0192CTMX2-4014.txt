J. K. Rowling has wrapped up her Harry Potter series with a vivid tale of life on the run for a young boy who isn't quite sure what he's supposed to be doing. The story has many moving moments and Harry displays the heart and courage we always suspected him of having. The explanation at the end for why one seeking total power is going to ultimately fail and be miserable is quietly convincing... I must imagine that someone like Stalin, or Hitler would have been paranoid and cruel as Voldemort was... They can't know love and cannot trust anyone. He cannot find any real happiness in their power...<br />Mostly this was just a fun read, however the darker more emotional moments really carry the story... Harry's sacrifice isn't all that convincing in itself but is still well done.<br /><br />I do hope this is the end, because I love this series and would hate to see this piece of work diluted. I also can't wait to see what new territories and stories Rowling may venture into next...<br />to new horizons Miss Rowling and thanks for the wonderful world of Harry Potter.
