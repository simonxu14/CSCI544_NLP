I just realized that I haven't reviewed this book yet.<br /><br />Without reading one other review, I know that there are people who will sum this book up much better than I.<br />But I will say this.<br />I was at the book release in Oak Park for book 7, hosted by Mugglenet.  The looks on the faces of the kids reflected my own, in their hopes for how it might end.<br />We all had amazing expectations.<br />J.K. Rowling's writing somehow exceeded our unworldly dreams.<br />Book 7 contains a few surprises that I won't spoil here.  I will, however, repeat my favorite thing about J.K.'s writing; previous things that seemed unimportant become important.  The complex relationship between the three main characters is rewarded in all of the best ways.<br />There is one scene that makes me weep every time I read it, for its bravery.<br />There are quotes that you will use as wise touchstones for your life.<br />You'll be moved by sorrow, reminded of real life evil, and never want to put down the book.<br />There is humility, love, nobility, sacrifice, humor, and joy.<br /><br />I'm a writer.  I hate most fiction, because I keep thinking: I could write this better.<br />J.K. Rowling had a lot to live up to when she created characters that I fell in love with.<br />She honors them with this book.
