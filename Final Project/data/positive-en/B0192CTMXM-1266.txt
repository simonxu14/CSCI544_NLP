I just finished the book and have to say it was great.  Ms. Rowling keeps making it darker and angrier in tone, but the storyline keeps evolving.  More creative characters were added, the new Dark Arts teacher is hateful, and the reader just keeps getting sucked into the story even more and more.  Just a wonderful addition to the series.
