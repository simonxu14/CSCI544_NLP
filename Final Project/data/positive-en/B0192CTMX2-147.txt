This book was so worth the wait. J.k. Rowling did an amazing job taking us through Harry's final journey. It was a gripping, exciting, happy, and sorrowful story full of so many surprises that it kept you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole tale. I am just so sad that it was the final book in the series but will be anxiously awaiting Rowling's next series of books. Bottom line- an absolutely awesome read!
