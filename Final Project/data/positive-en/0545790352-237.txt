Fantastic edition of this book! I have always loved the Harry Potter books and thought this would be a great way to share this story with my 6 year old nephew. I was right! He is hooked on this story! When we read neither one of us can wait until we get to the next illustration. They are beautiful pictures that suit the book nicely. I can't wait for the next illustrated version to come out!
