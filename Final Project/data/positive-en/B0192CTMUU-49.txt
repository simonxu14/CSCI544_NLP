Ok, so I'm a Harry Potter nut and have collected all seven books in hardcover.  The fourth, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, continues to send you and your children and grandchildren on the wonderful journey.  By now one knows the characters and it is interesting to see J.K. Rowling darken the story. I shopped Amazon used books and found books in wonderful condition and inexpensively too.
