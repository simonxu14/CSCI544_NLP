Oh my gosh!  What a roller coaster ride of emotions!  This has to be the best Harry Potter book of them all!  Have you ever felt such a roller coaster ride of emotions like this?  Excitement, fear, horror, confusion, happiness, sorrow, awe, resentment,and on and on .... so much to feel!  After 22 hours of reading my eyes hurt and I am exhausted... yet I don't want it to end.  I must read it all over again from the very beginning!  I so loved it all!  But so much loss.... so so sad.  But it was so perfect!  It all made such sense.  I wouldn't have had it any other way.  Way to scribe, JK Rowling.  Genius....pure genius!<br />JMHO  //(*_*)\\
