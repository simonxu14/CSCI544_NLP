Fantastic Beasts is really an extension of the Harry Potter books, especially Deathly Hallows. It picks up many of the themes and storylines suggested by that book and grounds them in deep and pertinent backstory. Though he is mentioned only once in the film, this is almost completely a continuation of Dumbledore's story. And it is all the better for that, because we are left with an enigmatic and ambiguous Dumbledore at the end of Deathly Hallows. The sense is that Rowling intends to clear up some of that, which dedicated Harry Potter fans will appreciate. I'm not sure how much the casual fan will appreciate the many subtle references and allusions, but to the true fan it is Mother's Milk.
