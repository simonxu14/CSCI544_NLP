What needs to be said when it comes to an illustrated Harry Potter book?  The quality of the art is terrific and incredibly detailed.  The book is larger than what it appears, which I love.  I've of course read all the books, but it was very enjoyable going back and reading the first book with the illustrations.  I always end up finding something new about each of the books when I go back and read them.  For whatever reason, I found myself reading through this version of the Sorcerer's Stone slower than what I usually do which just increased my level of enjoyment.<br /><br />Also, I can see how this would be a big hit with young children just getting into Harry Potter.  Kids are very visual and would absolutely love this book.  Very much looking forward to the future versions of each of the 6 remaining books.<br /><br />CONS:  Are you serious?!?! There are no cons to an illustrated Harry Potter Book :)<br /><br />OVERALL:  What a terrific item this is to own.  Would buy again a million times.
