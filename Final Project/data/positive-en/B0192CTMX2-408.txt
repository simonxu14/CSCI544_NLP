I am so sad the series is over. I just finished Book seven and am still a little depressed that the Harry Potter series is over. I too started reading them to my children and we all have been avid fans ever since. I had to let my two boys read this one first, so I was last in our family to read it. It is a great book. It was exciting, emotional, a little teary and just plain wonderful. What will we read now that "Harry" is over???
