By now pretty much everyone has heard of Harry Potter and knows what a good series it is. If you're a fan, or you're getting a child their first copy, I would strongly recommend getting this one. Even though I already own copies of the books, I plan on buying the full set of these as they're released because to me the plentiful high quality illustrations are completely worth it.
