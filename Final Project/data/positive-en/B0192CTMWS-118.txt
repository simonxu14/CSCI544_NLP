I tried to be critical.  I really did want to be one of those people that could tear this book apart.  I love Harry Potter, but I'm also something of a literary snob.  After all, this was the last book of the series and therefore must be flawed.<br /><br />Sorry, but I had to give full stars.  This is a great example of writing and storytelling and another fantastic visit into the world of Harry Potter.<br /><br />It is as if Ms. Rowling knew that she had to end her famous series with a bang.  Here she wraps up plotline after plotline, even as she introduces a startling new story that only adds more emotion and characterization.  It was a risky move, but a brave one that paid off as she wove together old and new into a poignant tapestry of story and emotion that keeps itself strong until long after I closed the book.  While everything is not ended in details, the reader will feel a sense of closure in most areas.  As for the exceptions, well, don't we all enjoy a good piece of deserved mystery?<br /><br />It also seems as if Ms. Rowling's writing as improved.  There is a small difference from the perky prose of the earlier books (which I truly did enjoy) but this darker, more poetic style works well for how the story has developed.  Her description and emotion is perfect, subtle, and spot-on as she leads our hero through his final adventures.<br /><br />The characters, to my great enjoyment, remain strong and true even as they have developed and changed.  I know many like to complain about character development that does not allow them to remain comfortable in a one-dimensional character, but I felt that all changes were very believable and appropriate.  Strangely, Ms. Rowling no longer sees a need to dwell on each character, but I feel that is best. Rather, she lets the characters go and do what they need to do.  It shows maturity for everyone.<br /><br />Then there is the plot itself. I know it is September, but I see no reason to reveal the plot. Suffice it to say that it is all that a Harry Potter plot should be--exciting, complex, and emotional.  Sure, there were a few developments that did not surprise me, but that's only because I have had years to debate, think, and obsess.  Fans should only be happy they are as intelligent as Ms. Rowling.  She keeps up the twists, turns, and seemingly unnecessary horrors that had be throwing down the book in fury only to snatch it up again once I had better control of myself--a mark of a great writer is one that can torture me so.<br /><br />I will now end with my own little cheesy testimonial:  Harry Potter has meant a great deal to me ever since I read the original.  I don't care how much hype the books have receive, I love them.  They are creative and fun, and I'm glad that the series ended as it did.<br /><br />Wonderful, wonderful conclusion full of all the emotion and adventure as one could wish.
