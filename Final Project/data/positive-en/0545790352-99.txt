I bought this for my daughter who is going to be a teacher. We are both huge Harry Potter fans and the drawings in this book are phenomenal. She was so excited to get it. She had to wait about two weeks,  but it is totally worth the wait. She took it down to read to the kids she babysit for and the pictures really pulled the younger kids in and held their interests.
