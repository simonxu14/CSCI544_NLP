Don't get me wrong; there were things about this book that I didn't care for; some of the "revelations" struck me as forced at best, downright out of character at worst. And there was enough death and destruction to keep the book from entirely escaping the "depressing" label. But of course, there had to be some of that in order to preserve a modicum of plausibility, so that's a fairly minor quibble.<br /><br />In general, what needs to be asked is, "Have you been following the series from the beginning?" If so, obviously, you MUST read this book; all I can say is, you won't be disappointed. The only possible reason not to would be having been put off by book six, which is certainly the weakest book in the series. Don't be; this one more than makes up for it. Also obviously, if you HAVEN'T read the previous six books, it would be a serious mistake to start with this one; the series as a whole is highly recommended (I'm sure you're aware of how hyped the series is; all I can say is, it is NOT over-rated; it actually deserves all the hype!) but by all means, go back and start with book one (Harry Potter & The Sorcerer's Stone); unless you're somebody who habitually reads the last page of a book first (I'm given to understand that there ARE such people out there) you will definitely NOT want to read this one before reading the others.
