As the mother of four children,  I have fallen in love with these books.  These books are not just about a magical world in which Harry Potter goes  to school, they are magic themselves because my 11 year old that hated to  read was given one as a birthday present from his stepfather and he  discovered the joy of reading!  (Thank you J.K. Rawling)  We own two  complete sets of these books at our house and reread them often, my kids  would rather reread a Harry Potter book than watch T.V.<br />Book four is  great, A little surprising and yes, I cried when the one character died.  Here at our house we are waiting and counting down until number five will  be released!
