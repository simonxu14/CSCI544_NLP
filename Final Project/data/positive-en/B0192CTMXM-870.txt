J.K. Rowling has kept the momentum going since the first book. I cannot express how gifted she is and how wonderfully these books are written. They are pure fantasy, yet, so many day-to-day life experiences can relate to them. Any age can read this, and by this I mean, the older crowd to the younger crowd. This will take you away on an adventure, back to another time. I am almost done reading this book, but wish it would never end. It is a wonderful series, and great read. I would recommend these books to everyone; although, I will say, I have witnessed even the busiest of children,(i.e children than cannot sit still and they are constantly moving...) sit and read her books. I applaud a great mind, and one with such creativity. I only wish there was more...<br />As this is the final book of the series, follow Harry, Ron and Hermione one last time.
