It's that time again! He's back and so is trouble.  Someone has opened up the chamber of secrets and something is turning Mudbloods (people with one unmagical parent and one magical parent) to stone! Great story and  unpredictable ending . Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is one of  the best books I've ever read!
