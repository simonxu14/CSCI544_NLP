What a wonderful world J. K. Rowling weaves. So intricate are the people and places she writes about. I love Hogwarts and Hagrid professor Dumbledore and how magical he is, I also have a big crush on professor Snape. lol this book is such a great escape from the boring 9 to 5 world. I love living in my HP books and this book was just as good as the others and maybe a little more because Harry's growing up and I can relate to the feelings hes having. GOOD GOOD BOOK!!!
