The book arrived as described: first edition hardcover. I have no complaints with the quality of the hardcover. I'm also not a literary critic, so I won't go into the book's content.<br /><br />There is one discrepency with ordering from this seller: they shipped the book in a plastic wrapper instead of a box. This caused the book to sustain dents on the paper cover as well has the actual hard cover. For this disappointment, I rate this product four stars instead of five.
