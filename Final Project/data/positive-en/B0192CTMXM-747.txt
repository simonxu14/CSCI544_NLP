I was itching for the third Harry Potter book to come out in my local book shop. I had already read the first two, so I was full of anticipation for this one. Book number three was my favorite of the series. I thought that I had read the climax of the story about half way through the book so I was quite happy that the last half of the book would be so exciting!! There is a feeling of content that I get from reading the Harry Potter books. This series gives off a feeling of coziness, excitement, adventure, effection, and much much more. I have read each of the series so many times that i know every word of it practically. I would like to thank J.K Rowling for giving me the pleasure of reading such an awesome book! Or books should i say. I read quite alot and I have written some stories for fun of my own, but I must say that the Harry Potter books are the best of all of the stories that I have read. And i must say I have read alot too!! Harry Potter books are the best of the best!! I can never thank the author enough for the joy she has given to me and many many people all over the world!!!
