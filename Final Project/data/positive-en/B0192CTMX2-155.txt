The first Harry Potter book was the hook that assured I'd buy all the rest of the series.  I switched to hardcover because the paperbacks were bulky and hard to read.  By book three Harry Potter has had his close calls and the author is beginning to increase the intensity of the characters.  There are fewer laughs and certainly more drama.  If you enjoyed books one and two you should enjoy the rest.
