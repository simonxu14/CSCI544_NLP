I purchased this book for my sister-in-law as a birthday present. When I received it in the mail, I flipped through it and became immediately jealous that I did not order one for myself. The cover does not do this book justice. Once I opened the book, I was enamored with the beautiful, very detailed illustrations. It was so cute seeing how Hagrid was drawn in this style, and he was probably my favorite illustration in the entire book. If you are a comic book lover, or a Harry Potter lover, you will find this book quite satisfying to read. I definitely can't wait to purchase one that I can keep. I hope they make these for all of the Harry Potter books, because they are amazing. It astounded me how much detail went into these artworks curated around the story. You can tell a lot of time was poured into this book, and I think that alone makes the price worth it. I know that this book is slightly expensive, but I honestly would have paid more for it because the quality is so phenomenal. I love that it is hardcover, because it seems so fitting for such a colorful, artistic book. Now here's to waiting for the next one! I am sure it will be just as wonderful! If I could give this book six stars, I absolutely would. Fantastic book! So glad I purchased it.... but as I said, I wish I would've bought one for myself too!
