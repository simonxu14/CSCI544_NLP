Harry Potter is maturing, and so is the tone of J.K. Rowlings' books.  The fourth book in the Harry Potter series is an excellent read, but it's a bit darker in places than the previous three.<br />It's also a good deal longer --  over 750 pages.<br />The central event of this book is a magcial tournament  that takes place between three rival schools of magic: Hogwarts (of  course), Beauxbatons, and the somewhat sinister Durmstrang.<br />In the  meantime, evil doings are afoot, both within Hogwarts and the Ministry of  Magic.<br />There's really no question that Harry will survive the book and  go on to star in books 5-7, but how you get there is most of the fun.  J.K.  Rowling manages once again to tell a completely engrossing story that is at  once moving, terrifying, and uplifting.
