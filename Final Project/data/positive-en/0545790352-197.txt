This book was so wonderful. I feel like I have been waiting for it to come out for ages. There is way more illustration than I could of even imagined, it's not some of the pages, it's the majority of the pages. It's a large hard cover, like a children's story book, with a paper cover to keep the book free from damage. It does include the entire first book just made more awesome by all the color illustrations. I originally thought I was going to give it to my children, but I honestly just can not bear the thought of it getting damaged. So instead it takes a place of honor on the bookshelf and we look at it together. The smaller children adore the illustrations and do not get bored looking at it. The older kids and myself are just thrilled to have a new Harry Potter item.<br /><br />I paid full price for this item.
