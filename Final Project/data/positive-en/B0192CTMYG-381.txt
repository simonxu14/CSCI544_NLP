I am a 6th grader and I liked this book because there was always something interesting going on and it made me want to keep reading. I would recomend this book for any level of reading and give it five stars.  I thought that  the author used good topics to write this story.  She also developed the  characters in such a way that you could feel empathy with the characters.  It was amazing how the author could get you so absorbed in her writing.
