I'm happy and sad at the same time because I finished reading this book so quickly!  I truly believe books are movies for the mind.  I'm 34-years-old and, when I read these books, I become a member of the school who goes everywhere and sees everything the character's do!  I consider Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid my friends!  In fact, I will probably name my next pet Hagrid!  When I finish reading each book, I don't want to let it go!
