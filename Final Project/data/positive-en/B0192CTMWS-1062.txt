I started to read this after lunch and its ater 11:00 pm. I could not stop until I had read it completly through on all 850 pages. Its a good read. Its worth it all. Can't wait until the next one to see what happens next. Will not spoil it for you, but its got heart, depth, imagination, a more mature Harry, and a more complete tapestry that unites even the earlier books. I have no higher praise than saying, its a good read and worth it all. I preordered my edition in January. Amazon got it to me this weekend on time.  Its worth it.
