I think that the best part of Harry potter and the Deathly Hallows Book on CD is that its unabridge. I have not bought many books on CD before because they were abridged, meaning thay had parts cut out so that it could fit on a smaller number of cds. This cut cost but also cut the heart of the books out. I am so glad that the Harry Potter books didn't go that way.
