The Harry Potter books are some of my favorite of all time. I grew up loving them, and each book has been read many times so the story is excellent of course. I bought this book to work on my Spanish reading comprehension since I know the book so well. I have taken a few years of Spanish but am not fluent. For reading skills this is a nice book but beginner-intermediate spanish readers should keep a Spanish dictionary on hand!
