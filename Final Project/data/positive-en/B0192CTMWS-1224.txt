As sad as it is that this is the end of the Harry Potter saga, this was an excellent read. As a matter of fact, I read it so fast the first time that I had to read it again so I could absorb and enjoy it more.<br /><br />If you're a Harry Potter fan, you'll love this book. It has all the laughter, anger, surprise, disappointment and yes, will bring tears to  your eyes. Enjoy!!!
