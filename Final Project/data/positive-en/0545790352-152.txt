I love this. The artwork is beautiful and it make sharing a story that I love with my 5 year old son easier. He loves pointing out the characters he recognizes and telling me about each picture. I hope they complete the series in this fashion so I can share the whole story with him. I would recommend this to any Potterhead or any child looking to find a bit of magic in the world. This just proves that Hogwarts is always there to welcome you home, always!
