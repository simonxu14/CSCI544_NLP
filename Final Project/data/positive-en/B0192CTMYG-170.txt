I am studying Spanish at the college level. As a native english speaker who has read all of the books in English. I feel like the magic translates wonderfully. Of course it is not a word for word translation, that is not how languages work :) . But I think that the way it is translated is true to the vibes of the original english verision, and is approchable by both Native Spanish and Native English speakers. Haters gonna hate. Buy the book, it is so worth ten bucks.
