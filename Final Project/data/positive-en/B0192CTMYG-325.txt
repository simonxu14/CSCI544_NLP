I bought the book because it's a (pop) cultural phenomenon and because I do like to read juvenile or YA fiction now and then, especially if it has a fantasy theme.  But I dragged my feet at opening it.  After all, I had a  pile of wonderful and worthy books to read, and what could possibly be so  good about the Harry Potter books?  I mean, I'm sure they are just fine for  the kids, but I've been an adult for a VERY long time.  Well--I was  WONDERFULLY surprised when I finally did start reading!  Sure, the  territory wasn't blazingly new--but it still had that quality that puts you  right back into your childhood--with all the fun and fears and terrors and  adventure and MAGIC that goes along with it. I totally devoured this book  and the two sequels and can hardly wait to read the 4th.  I feel like a kid  again, and it's just wonderful!
