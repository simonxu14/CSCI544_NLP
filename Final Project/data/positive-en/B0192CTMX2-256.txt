I've been a fan of HP since quite some time and waiting for this book was not easy, although never an option.<br />In this 5th installment of the series, we see a more deep, dark side of Harry. He's more angsty than before, and although not as noble in some levels, he is still noble and trying to do the right thing.<br />Some reviewers bashed Harry's "arrogance" and angster, I, however see it differently.<br />Harry is 15 now, he is a teenager, asn apparently some of the reviwers forgot what it means to be a teenager. Me, being 22, still remember how full of anger I was, to the point where not even I could stand myself. So for me Harry's behavior is more than understandable. And considering what he has been through, I would dare to say that he took many things rather well.<br />In this book HP notices how things dont always work with what is right. How unfair the world can be, and how short life is. He faces death is a more personal level, and I have to agree with another reviwer that said that a particular death in the book was very much below the belt since Harry has gone through way too much to add a death that is simply heartbreaking.<br />Ron and Hermione are their ususal self, but if they keep fighting I might smack them both in the head.<br />A new character (one of many) is introduced. Her name is Luna "Loony" Lovegood. She is so adorable an so weird, but she is extremely likeable.<br />Hagrid's bits in the book were quite boring, i must painfully admit. But Umbridge makes up for this seldom bits.<br />Dumbledore's character is also more elaborated. We get to see another side of his, and a side that can be viewed as weak, but I only see it as human, which only adds to the list of reasons why Voldemort only fears Dumbledore.<br />Overall the book was fantastic, but more depressive and sad, than any of the other. I have to agree with JK in why did she made it so dark and that is because as we grow older life starts to lose it's fairness and we start seeing things under a different light, just as Harry is learning to.<br />Poor Harry his journey is still not over, and more diffucult than probably anyone I know including myself.
