I did enjoy this book, although it is very long, and much darker than the earlier Harry Potter books.  Ms Rowling continues to "age" her characters in a very believable way.  And like many teenagers, the lead characters are often sad, moody, self-centered and so on.  I have read the book, but really enjoyed it more on audiotape, while commuting to work and back.  Jim Dale is such an excellent reader, and makes all the multiple characters come to life believably.  I "read" many books through the use of tapes in my car, and Jim Dale is the best, by far, reader I have listened to.  A great series of books, for kids and adults---the movies have been a disappointment to me, but the books will stand the test of time, I truly think.
