It is with great regret that I finished the Harry potter series. I have read each bbok with my children and look forward to them even more than they do. I found the final book to be a fabulous ending to a wonderful series. It ended in a way that I'm certain will leave everyone satisfied. I will not spoil the story for anyone, and I know that there will be some tears shed, but I can't believe that anyone will walk away from this series with questions or problems with the ending. Best of all... all my theories were correct!
