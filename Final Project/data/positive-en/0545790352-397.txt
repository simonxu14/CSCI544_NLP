Amazing illustrations. I read the whole series and wanted my daughter to start reading it too. She is afraid of scary and dangerous plot twists, which this book has plenty of. Illustrations help alleviate the tension for young readers and give a face to magical creatures and things, which are otherwise hard to imagine. Even my wife, who is not a fan of any fantasy books/movies, started reading. I can't wait to collect the whole series, even though it will take a couple of years.
