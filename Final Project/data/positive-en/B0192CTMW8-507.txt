I am a Very late comer to Harry Potter!<br />When everyone in the country was reading the series & becoming totally mesmerized, I felt like it was something I'd never sink my teeth into, or even understand it!<br />WoW, was I ever wrong LOL. I TOTALLY have fallen in love w/the whole series, the characters and all their adventures and dangers!<br />It is an excellent read, I see many more years of enjoyment, as I now own the entire series in hard cover and kindle edition.......<br />Happy Reading!!!!
