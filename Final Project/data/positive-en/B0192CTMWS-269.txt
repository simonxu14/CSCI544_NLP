What else can be said? Surely tons of people have jumped onto Amazon.com and other websites to post their thoughts about the book.  Surely people raced to finish to book and post spoilers everywhere.  I cannot imagine where people are waiting to read a review to make a decision on whether to pick up this book.  But if so, know this - this book was impossible to put down.  Harry is growing up, these characters are maturing and changing with the events they are enduring.  It was again a fascinating read, but the character development was beyond expectation.<br />I started reading the Harry Potter books when Chamber of Secrets came out.  I am sure I don't have a new story - friends laughed, it's a kids' story, slowly they got on the band wagon, indeed most of the world is on the band wagon, we all laugh and cry with Harry, religious zealots say the books should be burned, Hollywood makes millions, Lego makes little toys, blah blah blah.<br />But if somewhere someone is jaded, disillusioned, tired of the hype, turned away from the books because they believe they are above them, want to be different, or above the trends and "fads" of normalcy - you're a twit.  This book once again shows Ms. Rowling is a very much talented writer with a very good idea of where she is taking this story.  I thought when I finished the book I would be anxious for the sixth book.  Instead, I am anxious for the sixth and seventh.  I am anxious to see where it all is going now.  I have to know how it ends, even though it'll be the end of a great roller coaster of a ride.
