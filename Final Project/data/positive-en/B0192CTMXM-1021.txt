Full of all the familiar friends and introducing some new ones, this has the page-turning suspense and quirky details that have made the H.P. series a continuing success. Harry is 15 now, and has the concerns and reactions of a teenager. Often angry at adults,interested in yet confused by girls, and dealing with adult issues such as grief and loss, Rowling delivers a novel which is much more complex and adult in tone. An excellent book for an older reader, I would recommend that younger readers grow up with the previous books and read them at approximately the same age as Harry.Happy reading!
