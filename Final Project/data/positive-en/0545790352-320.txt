This is a beautifully illustrated book. The colors are rich and I enjoy how the art is blended together with the text, so you are not always presented with a picture on one page and the words on the other but rather they are put together.<br />I haven't had any problems with pages coming out or the binding pulling away.<br />This is a nice book to have in one's collection especially if you are a Harry Potter fan or want to use the book to read to little children. They should enjoy the art and the print is large so that they can read along easily.<br />I look forward to the next volumes to come. (Hopefully there will be more.)
