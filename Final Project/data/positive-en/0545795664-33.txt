I got this for my 6 year old, and accidentally ordered 2. My 11 year old immediately claimed the extra one, and they both love this book. It is filled with 1/2 page pictures and descriptions of pokemon, including pronunciation guides (which I especially liked). The reading level can be challenging for my 6 year old in places, but he will go for several pages before getting stuck on a new word.
