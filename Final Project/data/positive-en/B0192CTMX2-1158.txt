It is nice to see that Harry shows emotions and how exciting; dates for the first time. Unfortunately his school sweethart is not the right match so he moves on. Harry is quite a complex character which will be more and more exciting in the following books. Who will survive and who will die. I think we are looking forward to some wicked and wonderful experiences in the future.<br />As a muggle, I can not wait!<br />Well done.
