I feel sad about all the muggles who don't get it.  There is no hope for them, so the rest of us shouldn't be too hard on them when they don't like Harry. My very magical 79 yr.old Mom loves him.  My 20 yr. old son loves  him. My very cool 16 yr. old nephew loves him.  I'm 54 and I love him.  And,yes,we all would rather read than eat.  The books are piled high and we  have multiple copies of Tolkeins and Dahls and these books are right up  there with the best of them.
