My son read all the Harry Potter books as they were published, but I did not. As a Muggle, I was working and did not set aside the time to read them. I saw the movies as they came out, though, and I enjoyed them.<br />I asked my son how the movies stood up to the books. He said that they followed the books closely.<br />Recently I got the chance to read the first book on my Kindle for free. I downloaded it. I expected to begin it and get bored. After all, I've seen the movie, right?<br />But I suggest, those of you who have done the same, do give the book a read.<br />There are little details here and there that give you more depth into the story and characters.<br />As a Muggle, though, I don't understand why Rowling made the Dursleys so awful. Perhaps to make them less one dimensional would take up too much space or time in the story....
