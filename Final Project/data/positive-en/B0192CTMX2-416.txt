rowling pulled off the almost impossible by coming around with a suitable conclusion to her series.  well written, well detailed, totally in character, with definite hints as to the political parallells of today and yesterday.<br />  the battle at hogwarts is still one of the all time best moments... i found myself getting teary about a house elf....<br /><br />  overall a suitable ending. it does not disappoint.
