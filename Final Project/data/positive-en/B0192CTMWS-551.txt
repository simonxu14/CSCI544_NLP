In my view, this seventh and final installment of the Harry Potter series was easily the best of the lot, an impressive accomplishment considering how strong the predecessors were.  I am hard pressed to think of another series that not only avoided the trap of simply petering out, but actually ended strongly.  The book demonstrates that, rather than losing her touch in earlier books, Rowling was just biding her time, using some filler, to build up to this last book.  The movie of this book would be best as two movies--Part I and Part II.  There is simply not enough in this 700 pages that can be cut to make it single feature length.<br /><br />Gone are the 200 page sideshow events, such as the Quidditch World Cup or the Triwizard Tournament.  Instead, it is the battle between good and evil, period.  Rowling weaves in all her characters--in that way it is like the last episode of Seinfeld.  Unlike the use of the characters in that fiasco, however, this book amazingly puts them all to good and appropriate use--some big, some small, but never forced.<br /><br />Congratulations to Rowling, and thank you.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: DON'T READ THE NEXT PART UNLESS YOU HAVE FINISHED THE BOOK.<br /><br />I say Mad Eye Moody is still alive.  They never find his body, and what's the point of adding that in, if he is actually dead.  Then, when Hermione is disguised as Bellatrix, a man with a bandage over one eye (remember, they taken his "mad eye" to the ministry) attacks her.  That must be Mad Eye, sans eye.  Otherwise the episode seems entirely gratuitous.  Finally, late in the book, Harry thinks a lot about the deaths of Lupin and Tonks, but not at all about Mad Eye.  I suspect that Rowling had a later scene where Mad Eye comes back, but ended up cutting it and then just left these earlier parts as is.  If you have thoughts on this, please add them in the comment section.
