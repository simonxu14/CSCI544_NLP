Like Oliver, I still wanted more after reading the last of the seven-book Harry Potter series. This book has considerably more reflection than the other previous books, just to wrap up various character motivations. It also carried its own adventurous plot besides winding up the over-all one. I absolutely enjoyed reading this book. JK Rowling gave a fine epilogue for the main children characters, but I would have loved to know more about some of the characters I have become attached to over the course of reading the series.
