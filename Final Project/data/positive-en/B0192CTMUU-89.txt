Make no mistake, this book is bigger, darker and yes, better than the previous three (although I love each one for different reasons). Any HP fan knows that J.K. Rowling would have to take HP to another level in order to  improve upon the incredible first three books. Well, she's done it. We're  brought closer to Voldemort, we learn more about the history of all the  characters, and Harry, Ron and Hermione's friendship is tested. And all of  them are growing up, too.<br />Yes, it's darker, but don't be daunted by that  nor by the size of the book. Remember that Harry is growing up and it makes  sense that he's ready and able to tackle harder problems at 14 than he was  at 11. It's still an incredible book!<br />Sigh. The only problem with this  book is that I've already finished it and I don't know when the next one's  coming out! I thought I was hooked on the HP series before this one came  out, but now I'm dying to know what happens next! I think the only thing to  do is to reread &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot; and keep going from there.
