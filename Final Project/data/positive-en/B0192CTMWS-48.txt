A new professor and another year at Hogwarts. Our friends, Harry, Ron and Hermione, continue their education as two young wizards and a witch as well as their adventures at the Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. A quick and easy read, enjoyable for all ages. I love this series and recommend it for everyone with a desire for adventure and imagination.
