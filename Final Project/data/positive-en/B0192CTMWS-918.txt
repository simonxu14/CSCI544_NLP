WEll here is my two cents on the most anticipated book in my lifetime...I cannot wait until they make the movie.  Is it just me or does anyone else out there think Jo Rowlings is an good writer,not great.  I absoulutley love the storyline and this book is a great continuation of the story.  But,in my opinion the action and characters only come to life when viewed on screen.<br />The story goes that Harry and his order of the phoenix pals are battleing Voldemort to the death but some how Harry returns from the dead to slay the evil one.  I am not sure where he went and how he came back but the author really just kind of states the facts and does not explain the how and whys.<br />Cheers to all who have enjoyed this series and the filling out of the story in movie form.
