We review this book on a daily basis to learn the names of our new favorite Pokemon. We are new to Pokemon - the card game and the show so this book is an essential piece to the puzzle.  My 9 year old and 3 year old will sit together to learn their names.  The illustrations are big and colorful.  I would highly recommend this book if you are new to Pokemon.  Happy reading!!
