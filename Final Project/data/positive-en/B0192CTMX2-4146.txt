Wow!  I just couldn't wait for this book to come out!  After receiving it on it's release day I quickly plunged into it and really haven't put it down since!  The chapters always seem to end in a way that pulls you automatically into the next.  And I must say that the Order of the Phoenix is truely the darkest in the series yet.  But that won't mean that you will want to put it down.  Rowling's detail is supurb and continues to develop her highly complex characters.  You get a taste of the horribly nasty new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Umbridge, and further insight into the history around Professor Snape and Harry's father.  Even though the book is almost 900 pages, you will find each page truely worth it in a race to the end.  So don't delay!  Read Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix because you will surely not to be disappointed!
