The longest of the series. Has a lot of character build up (hatred toward Professor Umbridge), but the action doesn't really pick up until the end. I'd say it kicks the series into another level with Harry Potter now being 15 or 16 and being privy to more information, since you're an adult at 17 in the Wizarding world.
