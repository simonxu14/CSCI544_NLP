I usually don't write reviews, but this book is just amazing! I am do impressed with the quality and SIZE of the book! I thought the book was going to be the same size as the other hard cover books, but I was wrong! This book is HUGE which goes very well with the illustrations! I plan to save this (along with my originals) for my children to read. This is the perfect book to introduce children to Harry Potter! Definitely 5 stars!
