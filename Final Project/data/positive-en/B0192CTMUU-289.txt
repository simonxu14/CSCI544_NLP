Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is one of the greatest books of this century (Don't get me wrong, I like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, too!)  However I like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone better.  Harry  meets many more people in it then in the fourth one.  But I'm supposed to  tell you about this one.  Well, let me put it this way.  In this book there  is much more dark magic,  and intricate spells.  To tell anymore would  spoil the story.
