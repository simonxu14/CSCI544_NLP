Just to start off, yes, I'll admit, I already own all the harry potter books in hardcover, most in paperback, and in Kindle version. That being said, I LOVE the illustrated version!  It's absolutely beautiful, and I love the fact that a lot of the British phrases aren't edited like in the usual American version. I have absolutely no regret buying yet another copy of Sorceror's Stone, and I've already preordered my copy of the illustrated version of Chamber of Secrets. If you love Harry Potter, get this book.
