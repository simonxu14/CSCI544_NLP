J.K. Rowling has written another best-seller with this book!  The book starts off as the other three books: Harry with the Dureleys before going to Hogwarts.  However, this book turns to some more serious issues, such as jealousy and &quot;rights&quot; and even death.  This book definitely is darker than the other three books.  However, the darker parts of the book do not occur until the end, where Harry views the past and comes face-to-face with Voldemort.  I recommend this book to everyone, but I question if some younger children are ready for two dark parts of this book: death and murder.
