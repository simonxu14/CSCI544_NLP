I can't wait to introduce my kids to the Harry Potter series, and what better way than with this beautiful illustrated edition?!  My 8 year old son was intimidated by the size, but as soon as I mentioned it had pictures, he was all in.  His job: read it to his little sister!  It's gorgeous and a great value for the quality!
