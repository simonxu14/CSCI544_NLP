A delightful continuation of the Harry Potter saga.  I was completely surprised by the ending, after having thought I figured out a key plot element early on.  Don't let the length put you off (sales indicate nobody  is letting anything put them off), the book flies by quickly, is very  entertaining and exciting, and is never boring.  And for once they explain  how to pronounce Hermione's name!
