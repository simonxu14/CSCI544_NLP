I wish I had given in to temptation and bought a second copy of Goblet of Fire, to avoid the embarrassing tug of war I had with my 9 year old over whose turn it was to read.  I won't spoil the story, but it's every bit as every bit as wonderful as the last three books, and twice as long.  Plenty  of laughs, and middle school insights (like bubtubers and the Yule Ball)  that will have adults flashing back to 14.  A warning: don't try to read  the last 150 pages as a bedtime story.  It's too scary for kids and the  next good place to stop reading and go to sleep is the end of the book.  Thank you, Ms. Rowling, for a wonderful weekend!
