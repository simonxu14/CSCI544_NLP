Harry has aged 4 years since Sorceror's Stone; it shows in his attitude and the interactions of the other characters.  Since he is older and the story line more complex as the series progresses it becomes less accessible to the younger readers.  Humor continues here, though.  An adult reader can absorb the subtlties.  New fans of Potter may find this book hard to get into.  At 870 pages it is also a significant commitment of time.  During the summer this is possible.<br />Key elements: Harry and his friends face a rift in the wizarding world because of his claim that a dark wizard has returned.  He faces resentment and censure.  At School he also faces new obstacles.  He is no longer the wonderkind of the first book.  The Dumbledore character is enchanting and mysterious as usual although the beginning of the book would have you believe that he is being unfair to Harry.  The Order of the Phoenix does unfold into a captivating yarn once settled in at Hogwarts.  In this book that's about page 200.  It is a fair installment in the Potter series, yet I think that the age appeal is creeping up.
