Harry is growing up, turning 15 is diffiicult for any kid, much less one who has the life drama that Harry does.  Rowling does a wonderful job of storytelling, while never letting us forget Harry is a kid.. a kid who has had a difficult life, who is constantly under attack and who may lose everything he loves.<br /><br />Really wonderful
