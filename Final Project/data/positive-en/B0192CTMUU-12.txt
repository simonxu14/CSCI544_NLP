I'm revisiting all of the Harry Potter books and find them just as entertaining as I did years ago. It's interesting to see how J.K. Rowling's writing improved with each of her books. GOBLET OF FIRE had some very nice sections, especially the scene in the graveyard where Voldemort rises again. This is extremely well written, frightening and enthralling at the same time. The Harry Potter books remain one of the great literary achievements, and J.K. Rowling deserves all of her accolades. Yes, some people call them popcorn books, but they're much more than that. Ms. Rowling has created an amazing world and populated it with brilliant characters. I stand in awe.
