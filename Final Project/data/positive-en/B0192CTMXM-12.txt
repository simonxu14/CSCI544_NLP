Jim Dale is incredible for the entire series, but he does his best work yet for the climax of the 7 audiobooks. I actually get more out of the audiobook than I do out of reading the book, because I tend to read to fast and end up skimming important details. With the audiobook, I'm listening at a nice even pace, and get everything.<br /><br />The combination of J.K. Rowling's descriptive writing, and Jim Dales performance can't be beat! :)
