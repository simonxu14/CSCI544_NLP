Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is an absolutely amazing book.  Afer receiveing it on midnight on June 21, I couldn't not put the book down, and read 700 pages before retiring to bed.  After finishing the book today after work, I can safely say this book does not disappoint!  Huge plot points are everywhere, and the book's ending not only delivers but puts the series back on track for the home stretch!  Rowling can simply do no wrong, and if you had any doubts about picking this up, please reconsider.  You will not be disappointed!
