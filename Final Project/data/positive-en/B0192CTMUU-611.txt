I thought this was a good follow-up to the previous Harry Potter books.  However, it took a lot longer to get into the book.  I mean, Harry doesn't get back to Hogwarts until about pg 150!  The last 200 pages, though, were  well worth the wait.  I really enjoyed the tournament itself and enjoyed  all the twists and turns that occur at the end.  The Ministry politics were  also an interesting aspect of this book.  It is interesting to see that top  Ministry officials and Hogwarts staff do not agree on many issues.  This  book also dealt with some of the darker aspects of the series and had some  moments that will be scary for young children.  Parents might want to read  the book themselves first and decided what chapters or parts their children  should read.  The author's style reminds me a lot of Roald Dahl and his  excellent children's books, including: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,  Matilda, and the B.I.G.  I recommend this and the other Potter books to all  those interested in fantasy and fiction.  If you like the Potter books, you  might like authors like Lloyd Alexander or Dahl.
