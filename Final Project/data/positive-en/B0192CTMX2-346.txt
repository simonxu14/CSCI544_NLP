Who doesn't love Harry Potter and J.K. Rowling? I, as an adult, couldn't wait for each new book, and now my grandson has the fever and is reading it at 7+.  I had loaned out my originals, and am buying the series again, because these are books you cherish and keep and pass on to others. None of the books had the sheer magic of the first one, and they definitely got darker as the series progressed. The Harry Potter books represent literature at its best. It cuts across generational lines and reawakens the magic in all of us.
