I am not a rabid fan of Harry Potter but I did enjoy the books. This edition is stunning, with fantastic illustrations covering almost every page in an extremely satisfying way. I really look forward to reading this edition to my kids. Definitely worth re-buying the book and I'll get the whole set if they publish them.<br /><br />It's worth noting that Amazon's price is nearly 50% off which made this purchase a no-brainer.
