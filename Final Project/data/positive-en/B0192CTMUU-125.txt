Who doesn't love a child prodigy who is put to the test?  The games are a foot... and the goblet of fire is the goal.  The story was definitely necessary I think... and I was left with a wondering mind.  I love it when a story leaves wondering.  It brings you imagination out more.  It forces you to critically think on every character and setting detail.  Amazing book.
