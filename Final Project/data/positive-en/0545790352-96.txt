We love this book! My daughter and I share a love for the series so I was excited when this book was announced. Now I could share my love of Harry Potter with my 5 year old. He loves it! We read it aloud before bed and he loves the pictures. It is richly illustrated and has beautiful pictures. He has even been able to follow the story, which I wasn't sure he could. I highly recommend this for little Harry Potter fan. It definitely has helped spark his love of learning to read.
