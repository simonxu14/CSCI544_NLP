This book was overall very satisfying, but I am sad to see the series end.  I hope Ms. Rowling writes more about our heroes some day.<br /><br />Even though some parts are a little repetitive, and the dream sequence was a little confusing, there is enough action in this book to satisfy anyone.  I laughed, I cried, and at the end, I sighed with satisfaction.<br /><br />I recommend this book to all Harry Potter fans, and I most heartily recommend the entire series to anyone with an imagination.  I have personally seen my grandkids and my students reading these books voluntarily and with great enjoyment, when some of them had previously refused to read anything!  From reading these books, many of them have gone on to explore much more literature with appreciation and enjoyment.<br /><br />I do recommend that any Harry Potter newcomer begin by reading the first book, and read them all in order, as they all mesh perfectly together chronologically, and if not read in order, the reader will miss many subtle nuances that become important later.
