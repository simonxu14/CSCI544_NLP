BRAVO, J.K. Rowling!  Book 5 was definitely worth the wait � Ms. Rowling took the time to write a well-crafted, suspenseful and entertaining piece of fiction that I can honestly say that was one of her best!  While I felt that HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE was too long (Dickensian, in many parts) and contained too much extraneous information, I felt that all 800+ pages of Book 5 were fascinating and essential.<br />Ms. Rowling continues to express her genius through the remarkable fantasy world of wizards and witches, while making her characters both human and believable.  Harry and his friends experience all the growing pains of adolescence � from the growing interaction between the sexes to bouts of insecurity and  the questioning of authority�the adults deal with painful memories from their pasts while coping with the pressures and responsibilities of the present, and so forth.  She is also careful to avoid the black/white stereotyping of characters � those who we love are not always 100% loveable and those who we find despicable are not always evil.<br />The story is suspenseful,scary and sad in some parts yet still exciting and magical...simply wonderful (and all this from an adult reader who reads constantly)! A MUST READ FOR HARRY POTTER FANS OF ALL AGES!
