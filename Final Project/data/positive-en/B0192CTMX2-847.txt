I have already read this final book 3 times, marvelling each time that I discover new subtle details of the story. I am amazed at how well JK has woven together so many of the threads of the story from the 6 earlier books.  The series is so well integrated that she must have made a master plan 10 years ago in order for revelations in the final book to be so carefully hinted at in much earlier books. I believe that the Harry Potter saga will be unrivaled for at least a hundred years for inventiveness and craftmanship.  Many of JK's creations are already entering the English language. To those that scoff that the writing is inferior to the classics, I reply that either they are intellectual biggots or they have not read the books at their deepest level. I have read all the prior books at least 5 times each. Critics need to do the same before they are qualified to give an informed opinion.
