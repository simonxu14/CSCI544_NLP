The price is great at 23.99 for a beautifully illustrated hardback version. It's perfect for reading to my 7 year old who absolutely enjoys the first Harry Potter story. The only thing I found odd is that the protective paper cover is illustrated, but the actual hardback cover is red without any pictures or writing on it.
