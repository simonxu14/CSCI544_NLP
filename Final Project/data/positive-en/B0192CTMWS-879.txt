It was really great.  I'm a 34 year old married male, and so not exactly the target audience.  What do I care?  It was a terrific story that kept me up very, very late the last few nights.<br />It's not a criticism of the book, but I found this book less cheerful than the others.  It's simply a tough period in Harry's life, and he's at that age (15) where every boy is struggling to be a man.  He's grouchy, irritable, rash...  All the things most 15 year olds are.  There are certainly plenty of laughs, don't get me wrong, but it's just not a "happy" story.<br />Everyone who has read the first 4 will certainly read this, so I'll spare you the, "you should read this...", but I will say, no matter your age or gender, if you've not read any of the Harry Potter books, get to it!!  You'll be swept into the wizarding world, I promise!
