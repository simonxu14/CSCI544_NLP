I love the Harry Potter series and I love this book. Nearly everyone knows the story of the Boy under the cupboard, and this is the fifth book in the series. Harry is preparing for his first bout of standardized testing that determines the course of his career, or at least the classes that will finish out his schooling. The return of Lord Voldemort hovers over Harry as the overbearing Ministry of Magic publicly slanders our hero. Harry must face not only the painful reminders of his foes' growing strength as well as the formidable and cutesy Dolores Umbridge.
