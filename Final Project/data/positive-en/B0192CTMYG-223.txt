So the book came really fast, which is good since I lost this one from the set. The sad thing, though, was opening the box and finding a mashed corner. Two books were tossed in the box and absolutely nothing in there with them. It looks more like the book got crunched in the upper left hand corner of the front before it was even in the box. I was dismayed but it's not enough to bother sending back a paperback. Just a bit disappointing.
