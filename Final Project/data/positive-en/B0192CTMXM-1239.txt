I now have all the Harry Potter books on CD as well as in print. I love listening to them. The narrator is wonderful with the different voices for the characters. I admit I am quite familiar with the stories, to the point I can use them to focus on and let myself be read to sleep. I plan to share them with my grandchildren as they get old enough to enjoy them.
