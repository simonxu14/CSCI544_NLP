I write this review not in hopes that people will read it and be suddenly inspired to read Deathly Hallows, for all those who are Harry Potter fans will read his epic final tale regardless of what I have to say. I write this review as a sort of closure for myself, a true potter fan since the beginning.<br />This last tale, like its predecessors, was enthralling, witty, suspenseful and to say the least, magical.<br />Despite that just about every single Potter fan had a theory on the series' ending, I payed attention to only what I believed would result in the final chapters. While I won't be revealing any details about what that final outcome was, (just in case there is someone reading this who hasn't already read the book) I would like to say that Rowling left us with something incredibly true to the book's story line and its characters.<br />Just like 2 million other Harry Potter fans, I pre-ordered the book and immediately ripped it open after recieving the package. Throughout the following four hours it took me to read, I have to admit I did spend a lot of time in tears. Because I have grown up with these books, every time a character died I felt as if someone close to me was gone. The overall vibe I got from the novel was that of sorrow that the series was finally over.<br />Just by reading each book in the series a ridiculous amount of times, I feel like I know each and every character, just as I am sure many of the Harry Potter fans do. However, that makes me wonder as to just how difficult this finalization has been for Rowling, the creator of not only each individual character, but of the entire wizarding communtity and world.<br />Even though I consider Rowling to be a fantasy-writing genious, I doubt she nor anyone will be able to top these novels for years to come.<br />I am left with a bittersweet taste in my mouth. I love these books, but I don't think that I will be able to revisit the world of Harry Potter for quite some time.
