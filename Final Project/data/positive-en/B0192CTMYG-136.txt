After hearing so many recommendations on a Georgette Heyer listserv I belong to, I tried out HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE. I was quickly drawn into Harry's world, and I just had to read the others in the  series.<br />J. K. Rowling has created a very detailed world that people of  all ages will find enchanting. Harry quickly earns our sympathy when we  meet his horrible family, the Dursleys. We share Harry's joy when he  escapes their clutches to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and  Wizardry, where he is appreciated for the first time he can remember.  Hurrah for Harry Potter and J. K. Rowling!
