Great book for any age. Definitely a must read for anyone, especially readers who are ready for the next step up in chapter books. Harry's story and the people in it plus the scenarios flourish off the pages and come to life. Please read them; the movies are great, but the story is not justified until you open the book and read it for yourself!
