Once again, Jim Dale delivers an excellent adventure! Complete with all the voices, Jim does a superb job of bring the world of wizards and muggles to life. The tape set, longer then the first three Harry Potter  Books-on-Tape set, due to the length of the novel, is an enchanting way to  introduce a younger audience to the world of Harry Potter. I find, after  listening to all four stories on tape with my students, that when I sit to  re-read the adventures, I hear his voice in my head. His voice has the  ability to really bring the story to life, and along with J.K.'s ability to  write such colorful imagery into her stories, you can really picture all  the places and characters in these stories as real. What a gift these two  creative people have given to the imaginations of children and adults  everywhere. Buy it quick!
