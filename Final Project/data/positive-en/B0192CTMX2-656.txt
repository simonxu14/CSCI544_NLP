This book is wonderful!  I went through the whole process of pre-ordering this book, standing in line for my copy at midnight, etc.  I foolishly thought when I got home that I would browse the book for a half hour or so, but not start reading it until the following morning.  Once I began reading, I was hooked. Eating and sleeping became secondary.  The process of getting this book was well worth it.  I was worried that after anticipating The Order of the Phoenix for 3 years, I might feel less than satisfied after reading it.  Nothing could have been further from the truth.  The story was everything I could have hoped for and more.<br />One of the best things about the Harry Potter series has been that Harry and the other students have been allowed to realistically age.  In The Order of the Phoenix, Harry - as well as several of the students:  Ron, Neville, and Ginny - get to develop more as characters and are start to show signs of thinking more for themselves, rather than always reacting to everything (Hermione was 35 years old from the time we first "met" her so didn't have as much maturing to do as the rest).<br />I realize that book only came out today, but the main question I was left asking as soon as I finished reading The Order of the Phoenix was "When is Book 6 coming out?" (can I pre-order it yet?)  :-)
