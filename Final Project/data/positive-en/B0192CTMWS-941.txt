Of course, had to read this straight through and now I am so sorry that it is all over.  Why a four and not a five -- well, it is hard to wind-up a long-standing series and perhaps I reacted to the wind-up and the fact that it felt just a bit like a screenplay.<br /><br />The book keeps you in suspense with layers of plots and subplots, questionable motives and all of the frailties of good and evil.  The characters stay pretty much in character even as they have clearly matured.  Harry still has his lovability, strengths and insecurities that wind with him through the pages.  And there is a fitting scene for the ending (I was a bit unhappy that we did not get to spend too much time at Hogwartz this year).<br /><br />Enjoy the book.
