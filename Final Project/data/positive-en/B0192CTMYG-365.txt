I am a 63-year old grandma.  I sent the book to my 9 and 10 year old grandsons in Tacoma about a month ago.  Today, I called, and they are upset  because they have read the book three times already and want me to hurry up  and buy the next book - which I did, of course.  When they got the book,  they said they didn't think they would like it, but instead can't put it  down.  It has made the rounds through their school.  I bought it just to  see what all the fuss was about, and was delighted at the way the story  developed.  Can't wait myself to read the next one.
