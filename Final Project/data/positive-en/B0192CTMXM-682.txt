First things first--if you're a Harry Potter fan, which means if you enjoyed any of the other Harry Potter books--go ahead and rush your order, you won't be disappointed.<br />I read the whole thing in one great mass and I'm grateful for every minute of it--and ever so jealous of JK Rowlings. How does she keep doing it? This book was as good as the first four; if I had to choose, I'd put it better than 1, 3, and 4, and almost as good as number 2. I read it in six solid hours (wonderful hours!) today and am ready to start over again first thing in the morning.<br />Harry has grown. He's not an 11 year old anymore. He's 15 and everything he does makes that clear. He's angry and passionate and troubled; he's a teenager with every breath he takes. But for the fourth book in a series to stir so many questions is really quite amazing: I want to know more about Tonks, more about Neville, more about the centaurs, more about Luna. The one thing this book makes clear is that another one is coming and is absolutely required--believe me, you'll want to read the next as soon as you've finished this one. But at the same time, this is a thoroughly satisfying read. Every page was worthwhile. It's not often I finish a 870 page book and wish there were more to go!
