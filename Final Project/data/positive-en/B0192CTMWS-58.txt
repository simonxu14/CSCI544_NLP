I am over 40 and I have truly enjoyed reading this book as well as the other 4.  This one truely tore at my heart. To read and then feel Harry's hardships and how he felt about all the secrets kept from him, kept me so in touch with Harry and wondering about the rest of his world. These novels are show that humility, love, caring and determination can over come adversity. J. K. Rowlings has truly allowed the novels to grow up with the children/adults who are reading them. From the smaller novels to this one which was long, you are captivated by everything that happens.  You truly come to hate the "villians" in the story. I can not wait until Book 6 comes out. Oh, to be Harry and slip away to his world.
