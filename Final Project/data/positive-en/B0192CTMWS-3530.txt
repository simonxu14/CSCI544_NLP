Great book, but be prepared, it's significantly longer than any of the other books and will take some time to get through, more bang for your buck I guess.  It's a bit more mature and dark than the other titles as well, which is reasonable considering many children that grew up with the series are becoming more mature as well.  J.K. Rowling has proven to be an excellent writer and makes the books accessible to younger readers but interesting for older readers (like myself) as well.  Can't recommend it enough.
