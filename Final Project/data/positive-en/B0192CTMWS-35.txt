Been a fan of Harry Potter since I first got my claws on the books and so I decided to start reading them to my daughter at bed time. Now while I had a few moments of where I thought that this book was a bit dark and scary for her, due to the dementors, overall I think that she really liked it. The thrill of Harry Potter returning to Hogwarts, continuing to learn and meeting new teachers and having to face that he is the focus of a &#34;deadly&#34; criminal's focus.<br />Harry has a lot of growing up to do and much to learn but it's always great to be able to follow along and experience it with hi.
