Thanks so much to Ms. Rowling for bringing us this series. Her remarkable talent for invention, humor, pacing, dialogue, character, language, imagery - everything - is showcased best of all of in this last installment. I love these books, own each one, and plan to read them all again and again. I look forward to reading them to my children some day. (Though this last one will have to wait until they're older.)
