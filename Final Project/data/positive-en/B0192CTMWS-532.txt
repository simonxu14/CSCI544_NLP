I've read few series as intriguing as the Harry Potter series.  A year and a half ago I was sick and tired of hearing Harry Potter this and Harry Potter that without knowing what it was.  So I grudgingly went to the library to find out if the craziness had merit.  I picked up the first four books, checked them out, and opened the Sorcerer's Stone.....and was swept entirely away.  I quickly blew money I really did not have at the time on the whole series (but it was worth it!) and preordered this book, the fifth one, the Order of the Phoenix.<br />Out of all of them, this one is the longest, the most intriguing, and has some amazing changes, in not only Harry but his friends and those around him.<br />Harry is different in this one.  He's starting to grow older, and though it isn't directly said, let me just say his hormones, including his temper, is kicking in.  After four, and by the end, five, years of fighting Voldemort in one form or other, you can really tell it's starting to take it's toll on the Boy Who Lived.  A human can only handle so much, and the author J K Rowling realized this well.  We also see more of Snape and his history, as well as the death of a very beloved character.  Harry has gone from beloved celebrity to a sort of pirah with everyone thinking he's gone crazy--that Voldemort could not have returned!  He, Dumbledore, and others are facing a lot of trouble ahead because nobody believes them, except for those who know them best.<br />This book contains many adventures, and it's hard to keep mum on it, but telling much more will give away too many hints.  Just trust me, though, Rowling may have made us wait three years for this book, but the wait was more than worth it!  Go ahead, blow your money on the book--you'll be glad you did.
