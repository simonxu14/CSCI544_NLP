*SPOILERS*<br /><br />I love all the Harry Potter books and this one is no exception. There are so many twists and turns in this book and they keep you guessing until the end. The first time I read it, I had no clue how Hermione was getting to all her classes until the end. I loved being introduced to the Marauder's Map and Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. The funniest thing was when the Snape got a hold of the Map and it called him names. :) I feel bad for Snape sometimes because things just never go his way (a la the end of the book when he doesn't get the title of Order of Merlin because Sirius Black gets away). He just can't win. I wish that Lupin was able to continue on as DADA teacher. He was a lot of fun since he had practical classes. He's a great mentor for Harry during the school year. Another favorite part of the book - well, two actually - (1) when Malfoy is made to look a fool in Hogsmeade. Harry, under the invisibility cloak, throws muck at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle; (2) When Hermione gets so fed up with Malfoy that she hits him. Overall, just a fun book.
