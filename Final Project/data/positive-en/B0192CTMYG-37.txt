I am obsessed with these Audiobooks. Jim Dale is so great to listen to and he really makes the stories come alive with all of the voices he uses for the different characters. I purchased the cassette tape version of the books (I still have a walkman!), and the quality is great for how outdated that technology is. I have never had an issue with any of the tapes in the 1+ years I have been listening to them.
