The quest is finally complete. Having just finished Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, I can say that if nothing else, I'm satisfied.<br /><br />Did things go exactly as I expected them to go or even the way that I truly wanted to go? In some cases yes and in others no, but that's why we read, right? J.K. Rowling has done a very nice job wrapping up loose ends and explaining the previously unexplained in this culmination of her much heralded series.<br /><br />Of all of the books, this one is by far the most complete; leaving the reader feeling sad over the fact that there are no more Potter books to come, but at least a little fulfilled and with a lot less questions than before. Yes, there are tear-jerker moments in the book and things that Harry and his friends could have done much quicker if only they would use their brains. But, overall it is a grand story and the pacing from beginning to end is fairly fast and furious.<br /><br />I give Rowling an A+ on her efforts and look forward to whatever worlds she decides to take us to next.
