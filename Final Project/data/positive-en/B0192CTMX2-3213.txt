It's really interesting to see what has happened to the Harry Potter series.  It started out as a classic children's adventure story, and 7 books later it has essentially morphed into a marvelous adult horror story.  The first couple of books mostly focused on being "cute" and here at the end we have one of the most suspenseful books I've ever read.  This is certainly not a criticism mind you.  Each book has become more and more ambitious and also widened their appeal proportionally.<br /><br />While I started off as a very reluctant Harry Potter reader, I can say that I am now a huge fan.  I can honestly say that the Deathly Hollows is by far my favorite of the series and one of my all time favorites.  What I regret though is that it's all over.  The Hogwarts world has become such a rich and engrossing world that it is difficult to accept that there won't be more stories.<br /><br />And for those concerned that you'll hate the ending, don't be.  Rowling did a great job with that.  No Sopranos-esque debacles here.  Here we have a writer that really knows how to finish off an epic story.
