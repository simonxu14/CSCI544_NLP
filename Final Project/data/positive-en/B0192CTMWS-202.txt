Bought this book for my son who just recently got into Harry Potter.  He is in 3rd grade and is a great reader so these books are more of a challenge than most material geared towards his age.  He loves the characters, their development and interactions along with the twists and turns in the story line.  The Harry Potter series spans so many ages and is a great read for pretty much anyone.  He can hardly wait to get the next couple of books in the series.
