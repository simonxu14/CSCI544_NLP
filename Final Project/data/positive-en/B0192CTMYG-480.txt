I haven't read all of the reviews on Harry Potter audio books at Amazon but the ones I found refer to the &quot;paper&quot; books. Then I feel I must pay a special tribute to Jim Dale, the narrator of the audio books. I've read (well, listened) hundreds of audio books and the Harry Potter books are definitely the best. There is no doubt that has a lot to do with the books themselves but Jim Dale's reading adds rich colors to so many characters that they become alive and &quot;jump out of the paper&quot;, as a Chinese saying goes. Out of all the media (paper, audio and movie) of Harry Potter books I personally enjoy the audio the most. I never read any Harry Potter until I started listening to book 3(!) by chance. Within 1/2 hour I was hooked. Try it!
