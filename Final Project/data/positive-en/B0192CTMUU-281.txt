i enjoyed reading this story, and am happy that Rowling made it longer. the characters are enjoyable to follow and a longer story just made it even better. i am a fast reader, and were it short, i would have finished it too quickly.<br />i give it only four stars because it does feel like she has already used up her imaginative stuff in the first three and now is beginning to repeat her stuff. it may be that she was rushed into finishing this book. we'll see if a pattern holds up once we get the fifth book out.
