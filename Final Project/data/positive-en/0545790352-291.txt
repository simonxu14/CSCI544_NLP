Extraordinary illustration and superb story (if you haven't already read it before ;) Each page is detailed in some way, whether it's a full picture or just a few stray blots of ink. This book is a must have for any Harry Potter fan. Even the outer cover and binding is in rich detail that well represents the 'feel' of the wizarding world of Harry Potter. I look forward to the next illustrated installment.
