A look at the Acknowledgment section reveals that this book is dedicated to us, the mudblood readers of Harry Potter, all 9 million of us, and to those "who have stuck with Harry until the very end."  After reading Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, there can be no doubt this book, in J. K. Rowling's series of seven, covering the seven years Harry Potter has attended the Hogwarts School of Magic, is the last.<br /><br />Hard to imagine why anyone would read this book without reading the other six first.  The books do build naturally upon one another.  Now that it's over, one could conceivably buy the seven volumes and set out to read them all straight through.  That would be fun.  On the other hand, I have enjoyed, as millions of readers have, anticipating the publishing of each volume, the lines at the bookstore, the hype.  For me I've read, except for this one, the paperback edition.  But now I find that no way am I waiting a year for this paperback to come out.  Like Harry, I'm ready to finish this thing now.<br /><br />I envy the reader who has just discovered Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Year One at Hogwarts.  But now that I've read them all, I'm starting over.  And I would recommend, start at the beginning of this journey.  What can I say though to the reader who has read Book Six and like me, trying not to listen to the spoilers, waiting for the much more economical paperback to come out in a year's time?  What if you can't wait another day, much less a year, to find out what really happened to Dumbledore?  Can you wait to find out who wins, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named or Harry Potter?  I didn't think so.  The books are a circle and this one connects them all.  And why wait when Amazon has the book on sale?
