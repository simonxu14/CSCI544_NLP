The worst thing about this series was waitng so long between books. The writing was good, and "British" enough that Amazon probably sold more than a few English/English dictionaries- no one cared because the stories are that good.<br /><br />Don't start reading the series with this book, go back to the beginning so you'll better understand what's going on. I find all of the books good enough that I really don't (while reading) notice that they've gotten to be 700+ pages long.<br /><br />This book might have been the most "British" of all in the American edition of the series, I'd heard that the American and British editions were becoming more alike as time went on, with more "blimey" and "bloke" than the earlier books. I thinnk there might be a little more mild swearing than in previous books but the average 12 year old has heard as much or worse even at that. There's a little alcohol drinking here but then a wizard/ witch comes of age at 17, not the muggle 18.<br /><br />The biggest suprise for me was in the dating given in the text. Harry's parents died 16 years before, in 1981, which would make the bulk of the story set in 1997 the year the first Potter book came out in the UK.
