The 5th edition of the Harry Potter series The Order of the Phoenix has all the makings of a classic thriller. Each chapter characteristically ends with intrigue and leaves one unable to put the book down. ...I highly recommend this book, but note that it is a more personal tale than the others, where we more of Harry's personality and not just his persona. It is also darker than the others at least in the end.<br />Some pieces of it are so well-written you will find yourself repeating them again and again. I will not tel how it ends, but it will leave you wanting more as is characteristic of all Rowling's books.
