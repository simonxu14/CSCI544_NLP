As expected, this Harry Potter was the best yet.  It is sad to think the series is over, but this book ties up all the loose ends and makes you happy that you were part of such a wonderful saga.  JK Rowling hits a home run with this final chapter. I only hope that she can find a new character to entice us with in the coming years.
