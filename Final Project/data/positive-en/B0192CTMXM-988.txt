There is only one negative thing you can say about this book - as long as it is it still has to end sometime!  Rowling does not dissapoint - it was worth the wait.  I'm already looking forward to reading it again - the plot is so compelling that I couldn't read it quickly enough the first pass, so now I intend to read it again and savor all of the little details. Be prepared to spend some time with your heart in your throat - Rowling's hint that someone important dies is no lie - but so many of your favorite characters are in mortal peril at one time or another that you'll be worried about one or more of them at many points during the story.
