First, the Harry Potter series is wonderful.  Thank you, J.K. Rowling.  Second, Jim Dale who does the audio books is fantastic.  I first bought these books when my son was young and we listened to them together.  I am now replacing some of the cassette versions I had.  I'm re-reading this one for about the 10th time.
