The Prisoner of Azkaban was full of action and magic. Unexpected twists and turns. I could not stop reading it. I sat down to read a couple of chapters this morning and just finished it tonight. I loved the ending! I recommend this book to anyone. Harry discovers the truth about the servant of Voldemort and the truth about Sirus Black. As Harry is getting older he is starting to face things that scare even the reader!! Spectacular!!!
