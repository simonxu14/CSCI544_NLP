So upon looking through every single Pokemon, we noticed that where a picture of Spearow should have been, they put a picture of Fearow!  So I went back to see what picture was in place of Fearow to see if they accidentally switched the photos, but alas, they just apparently hate Spearow and put a picture of Fearow in place of both pictures.  But that's apparently all that's wrong with it.  Good thing I'm not a huge fan of either of those Pokemon.
