After a three year wait that seemed like ten times that, receiving<br />this book at my door one June afternoon was a long-awaited<br />pleasure.<br />The obvious question is, "was it worth the wait?"<br />Well...not entirely. Without a doubt, its an entertaining<br />novel. But there are plot holes large enough to stuff the<br />whole of Hogwarts. And the plot, annoyingly, depends on<br />keeping Harry, and with him, the readers, completely in<br />the dark. Unfortunately, (I'm trying to avoid spoilers<br />here, so forgive the non-specificness of this) his being<br />kept in the dark is out of character for the characters<br />who are responsible for it.<br />It's still fun, though. And, keeping in mind that this<br />is ultimately children's literature, I find plot holes<br />more forgivable than in, say, a heavy duty spy novel.<br />The characters are still as vibrant as ever. The new<br />antagonist of Professor Umbridge (I *love* that name)<br />is a great character, even if she is highly dislikable.<br />And her "cat-fight" with McGonagall is scathingly<br />funny.<br />THis may not be up to the quality of the earlier books<br />in the series, but it only disappoints mildly.
