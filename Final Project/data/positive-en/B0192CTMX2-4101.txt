JKR did a magnificent job of writing a satisfying ending to a wonderful series.  The book has great pacing, continued to show the development of the characters and does a nice job of tying up all the plot elements.  As another  reviewer pointed out, the nice thing is nothing is forced--the finale comes together naturally.<br /><br />Yes, it is dark and we lose some favorite characters, but nothing is gratuitous and the losses provide the perfect backdrop for some of the deeper themes of the story.
