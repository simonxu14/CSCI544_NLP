JK Rowling did a very good job linking past books into this one. As always the book was a bit too wordy and most certainly could have been cut in half. I'm 52 and have been a fan of the Potter series since its inception. My only disappointment in the way the series ended is that the author did not say what the original group (except Neville) was doing with their lives 19 years later after the defeat of Valdemort. Other than that I'd say the explanation of Snapes' dislike of Potter from the beginning was believable and plausible, the defeat of Valdemort was brilliant, and the lessons learned applicable to any generation. Life is about love and hope and the Potter series truly delivers.
