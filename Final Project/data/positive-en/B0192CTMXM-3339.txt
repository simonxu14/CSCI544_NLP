The final installment in the Harry Potter series does not disappoint; in fact, it's wonderful.  All the loose ends are tied up and we even have an epilogue that brings us years into the future.<br /><br />Harry is continuing the horcrux search he began in Book 6 and he also looks for three deadly "hallows" (magical objects that make one master over Death.)  True-blue pals (and sometimes-snoggers) Ron and Hermione accompany Harry on his quest, which finally brings him  back to Hogwarts for the big showdown with the Dark Lord.  When Harry and Voldemort finally face-off in the end, it is a scene that truly rewards our patience and leaves one exhausted and satisfied.<br /><br />I felt the length was just right and it's a quick read, even though some scenes in the middle do go on longer than necessary. The themes of friendship and courage remain constant in "Hallows" - Harry, Ron, and Hermione maintain their loyalty to each other and steadfast belief in Good over Evil.  This is, for me, a perfect ending to a great series.
