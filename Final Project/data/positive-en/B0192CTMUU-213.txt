Yes, it's over 700 pages...but I still finished it in one night. You won't find yourself counting pages left, I promise.<br />Yes, it's up to par. Rowling continues with some threads she'd started in earlier books (we do  get to see more of Sirius Black) and starts some interesting new ones (I'm  especially curious about Hermione and the house-elf liberation front).<br />If  there's anyone left who hasn't read the earlier books, it's best to start  at the beginning and work your way through, but Goblet of Fire does have  plenty of reminders and explanations of what happened in the earlier books,  in case you've forgotten anything.  Goblet of Fire is a little darker than  the earlier books (the death Rowling warned us of is not who you thought it  would be), but I still found myself laughing out loud in several spots.  You won't be disappointed.
