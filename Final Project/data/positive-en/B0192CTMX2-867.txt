I received this book on the day of release but didn't open it until I had a day off. I suspected that I wouldn't want to put down until I'd finished reading the whole story. I was right. Ms. Rowling is very gifted at helping us to feel what Harry feels so the beginning of the book leaves the reader feeling a bit unsettled and not entirely happy. The story is one of uncertainly and conflict, one that will probably not be resolved until the last book of the series arrives at it's final page. As with the stories preceding this one, the current piece of the larger conflict between Lord Voldemort and his followers and the rest of the wizarding world is carefully built until the confrontation at the climax of this installment of the story. It's a great story and a satisfying read. I find myself impatient now for the publication of Book 6 in the series.
