If you're contemplating reading this book, then you've obviously read the other books in the series so I don't have to tell you what a great writer Rowling is. This book is a memorable, exceptional conclusion to the series. I was concerned the book would become confusing with the deathly hallows layered over the search for the horcruxes, but everything comes together beautifully. Rowling is amazing.  A must read.
