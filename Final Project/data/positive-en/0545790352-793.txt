This is such a stunningly beautiful edition. I had been on the fence before purchasing, but I'm so happy I did. This is especially great because I got into the series too late to collect the original hardbacks, so my collection is a hodgepodge of hardcover and paperbacks which are all beginning to show their age. This will be so great to share with children who are new to the wizarding world! (Sorry for the shadows in my pic, I'm outdoors!)
