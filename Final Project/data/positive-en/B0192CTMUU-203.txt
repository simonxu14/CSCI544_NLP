Rowling has topped herself. I'm very impressed and looking forward with great anticipation to book Five.  The Goblet of fire continues Harry's quest to become a full fledged wizard. In this, the pivotal fourth book,  Rowling succesfully ups the anti for Harry--and lord Voldmort and every one  else--as we are introduced to a wider globe of magical creatures and  peoples and places as two historicaly international events (The Quidditch  World Cup and the Triinternatonail Wizard tournament) open both harry's and  the readers horizens. As usual Rowling's great gift of character keeps the  plot sparkling as we never know until the end exactly who is who in the  battle for good vs evil and we are introduced to a spell that blurs the  lines of responsiblity and culpablity even further. Highly recomend I  stayed up until five in the morning to finish my only regret is that I now  have a LONG WAIT for book five.
