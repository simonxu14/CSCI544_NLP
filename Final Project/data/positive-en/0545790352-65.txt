We are a HP family, but my niece isn't the biggest fan of reading, so she's never read the Harry Potter books. She has seen and loves the movies and decided that for her 10th birthday she wanted to have a HP party, so when this book was released I KNEW it would be the perfect gift. I wasn't wrong, she loves it and has been reading it, slowly but surely. The pictures are gorgeous and the book is a really high quality. She loves the ribbon book mark (its the little things!) and we all can't stop smelling the book.
