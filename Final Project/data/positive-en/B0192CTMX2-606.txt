I waited a long time for a book that took me all of four days to read, so now I am back to waiting again.  Feels sorta like S. King's Dark Tower series.  Plenty of folks will go on and on about the book's finer points and the books not so fine points.  I could do the same, but why bother?  If you are a Harry Potter fan, you will read this book.  If not, this is not the ideal starting point.<br />The book is long, the book is good, the book is dark.  The feel good moments in this novel are scarcely there, if there at all.  I think that JK Rowling has stopped focusing on the younger folks with her writing and has realized that she can really strike a cord with the older crowd who have already been through what our young hero is experiencing.  If the book were a movie, it would be a definite PG-13 for all but the most mature kids who are reading out there.  That said, the fifteen year old angst that Rowling captures is quite powerful and moving.  Some characters develop quite nicely, while others move in somewhat unexpected directions(that is a good thing, people).<br />My only real gripe is that the death of an important character was handled rather badly.  It didn't get the build up it deserved; however, it leaves room for much Harry development in the future.  I know some have complained about the length, but I hope the following two editions maintain the 800 page range.  Longer would be too much, but when waiting three years between publications, anything else is too little.
