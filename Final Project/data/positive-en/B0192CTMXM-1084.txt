The book is definitely great. I used to own it, but I don't know what happened to it. I replaced all of the books that went missing, and bought the ones I never owned. I purchased the third book, and when it came... it was still the book, but with a completely different cover than was advertised. I thought it might have been the UK version, but it turns out it's the "children's version", or so my sister told me. Either way, the book is still the same. That's why I'm giving this rating a 4 star instead of 5.
