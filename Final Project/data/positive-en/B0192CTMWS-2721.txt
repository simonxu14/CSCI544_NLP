Being a huge fan of the entire series, I fount this book to be the perfect ending to 7 years of struggles and triumphs. It had a little bit of everything in it with regards to emotions. I could see where some might not appreciate the ending, but for me, it was well-written and cathartic. Great, great book (and series)!
