The literally millions of us who have had the opportunity to follow Harry as his adventures played out were truly privileged . The Potter series is a rare literary feat and looking back, one can only marvel at its brilliance and looking sadly forward, wonder what will fill the void.<br /><br />True, the movies, if done well will help, but ultimately, the Potter series will be irreplaceable.<br /><br />Thank you Ms Rowling!!!!!!!!
