I finally got around to purchasing the last Harry Potter book and that gave me a good reason to sit and reread all the rest of them.  I don't know if it is because of reading all 7 books in a row or not, but there were parts of this last book that seemed to drag a bit.  However, I absolutely love the entire series and still feel as I did when I read the first book:  They are totally delightful -- and I'm a senior citizen. I certainly do not see why these books were ever classed as children's literature, although kids enjoy them also.
