Ok, so I'm a Harry Potter nut and have collected all seven books in hardcopy. Paperbacks are fine but you almost break the binding trying to read the books. The second book, Chamber of Secrets, continues to send you, your children and grandchildren on a wonderful journey.  I shopped Amazon used books and found books in wonderful condition and inexpensively too.
