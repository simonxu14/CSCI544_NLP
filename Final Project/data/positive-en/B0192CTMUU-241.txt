Rowling's 4th book is a great adventure and can be appreciated on many levels.  This story however is about 200 pages too long.  As both an  English teacher and a reading specialist I found myself wondering if she  was being paid by the page as the plot really drags at times. Otherwise,  the characters are developed well and the plot is clever and nicely woven  back to the previous books.  (I would suggest that Ms. Rowling request her  publisher's, Scholastic, hire a qualified, experienced proofreader with a  background in grammar as the errors become downright annoying at times!)  The climax was excellent and the resolution was handled beautifully.  Looking forward to #5.
