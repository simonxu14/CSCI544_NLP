RE-READ THE MAGIC!<br />Being that I am an adult and was also an adult when I read this story the first time it was published  I kind of surprised myself when I knew I had to own this copy. So glad that I listened to my enter Hermione and brought it. What a wonderful copy this is. It really brings the world of Harry Potter to life once more. The artwork is the real star to this book as well as the size. If you are a fan of HP this is a must have, If you have a child who has never read HP, this is a must have. What a great Christmas gift this will make. I am thinking of buying copies to donate to my local library and children's hospital. The movies are great but nothing is better than opening the book and getting lost in the pages. Thank You again, JKR.
