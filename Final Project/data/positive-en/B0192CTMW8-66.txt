The second year at Hogwarts gets better and better, and as one who has read the entire series several times, I appreciate Rowling's foreshadowing and literary ability while keeping the series (so far) a great one for children as well as adults. Interestingly, in order to complete the task set for Harry in the first book, he needed friends Ron and Hermione almost to the end of the quest, when he needed Dumbledore's direct help. In this second book, Ron accompanies Harry to a point and then he is on his own, until he needs Dumbledore's indirect help. The development of the plot and characters are brilliant. I love these books.
