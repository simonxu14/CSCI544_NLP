I pre-ordered this months ago, and have been waiting impatiently for it to arrive. It finally arrived today!! Nearly everyone knows the story, and anyone who ordered the first in the series that was illustrated by Jim Kay already know they are in for a real treat! The images in this book are much darker than the first. Since the story is significantly darker, it makes perfect sense. The cover is stunning, and the book has high quality paper that suits the beautiful art work. I've included just a few of the images from the over 100 exceptional illustrations in the book so you can judge for yourself. Extremely pleased with this latest installment and proud to have it in my collection - now I just have to impatiently have to wait a year for Prisoner of Azkaban!
