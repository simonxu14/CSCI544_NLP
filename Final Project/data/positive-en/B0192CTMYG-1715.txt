My son LOVES Harry Potter books & movies. The books have so much more detail than the movies, that for such a great price I couldn't pass this deal up. My son is now wanting ALL of the Harry Potter books.<br /><br />This is a great book to get those kids who aren't that interested in reading, REALLY interested. The son who I purchased this book for almost NEVER likes to read, but this is one book he LOVES to read.<br /><br />As an aside, reading Harrp Potter, or Fantasy books will not give your son or daughter "demon issues". If books with Wizards and magicians did that I and all of my friends who read "The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe" would have "demon issues" as well. LOL!
