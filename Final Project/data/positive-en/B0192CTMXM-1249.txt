I loved this book!  I think it was well worth the wait.  I'm so glad to have all the questions finally answered and be able to understand the motives of Dumbledore and Snape.  We were even able to finally understand Petunia!  I'm really going to miss this series.  I think it will be a very long time before we run upon something that even slightly compares.
