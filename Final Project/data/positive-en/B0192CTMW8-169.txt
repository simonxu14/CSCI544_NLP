I am a middle school librarian.  I can't wait to get back to school to share Harry Potter's latest adventure with the children!  Ms. Rowling has the gift of storytelling.  Her imagination never ceased to amaze me.  I  truly hope she never lets Harry graduate and we can read of his wizard  school adventures for years to come.  I can't think of any 12 year old that  wouldn't enjoy this book.  It's marvelous.
