Fortunately, I was able to read this title without having many of the spoilers available online. This was a fine ending to the Potter series and many of the loose ends were tied up well while a few new "loose ends" were not. There were some disappointing moments and some wonderful surprises which is why I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars-if 4.5 were possible, I'd have given it that. It's clear that anyone who loves Harry has already bought this book and those who haven't fallen under his spell will probably not be inclined to start here. If you're sitting on the fence, read the first Harry Potter and then see if you want to continue. I think you will.
