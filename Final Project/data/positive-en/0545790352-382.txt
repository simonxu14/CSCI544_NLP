I am apart of the generation that grew up reading the Harry Potter books. You know that series you where just dying for the next one to come out well this was that series for me! But the funny thing is that I do not own a single edition of any of the series but when I heard that they where coming out with an illustrated edition I couldn't help but preorder. BOY was I not disappointed! This is the most beautiful edition of this series that I have ever seen and am so excited to share both the illustrations and story with my two children. I will continue to collect these editions and share them!
