Excellent writing except... The Harry Potter series is so imaginative and well written it is really hard to find fault with any of the books. The author's creativity dazzles me (as an adult) and keeps me moving through  the pages. As Principal of an elementary school, I try to keep abreast of  the most popular books our children are reading. These books are certainly  popular. There is one tendency, however, the author seems to prefer to get  Harry out of trouble after he has been caught breaking the rules at home or  at Hogswart- the adults excuse (rescue)him from the consequences. The only  time Harry has been held accountable for a transgression was when professor  Snapes(I believe) gave him detention in book 1. In all three books there  are examples of the adults playing rescuing roles feeling sorry for Harry  perhaps because of his background or the current problem is which he is a  party( by choice most times). While I understand compassion, still here is  an area that perhaps needs a look if Ms. Rowling writes the fourth book.  Maybe Harry needs to get out of his own predicaments which may mean  suffering some consequences and the adults seen by the readers as  consistent in enforcing the rules, while still offering compassion, help  and encouragement. Again, all of the books are sooooooooo well written.  Fine pieces of literary work.
