On the whole I'm very pleased with the way the series ended. A lot of things were different than I'd guessed but hey, no problem there. I'm not going to write any spoilers in this review, unless saying that I wish the epilogue could have been less exculsive counts. That was my only standout complaint at any rate. Many people have torn this book apart, some a bit viciously, but having the internet, I see that sort of thing all the time. My opinion still remains intact and will endure. I loved this book as much as I have the others.<br /><br />Thanks for such an enjoyable journey, JKR!
