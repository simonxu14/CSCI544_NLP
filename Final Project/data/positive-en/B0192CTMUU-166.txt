I pre-ordered this book from Amazon as soon as I knew I could. I was so happy to receive the free saturday delivery from them that I had to put aside everything else that I was working on that day and just begin to  read. This is definately the longest and most involved Harry Potter book  yet, but also one of the best Harry Potter's book yet! If you have read any  of the previous 3 then you will have to pick this book up...<br />I don't want  to give away the plot for anybody, but I will say that this book is just as  chilling and thrilling as the previous ones. If you have just recently read  or re-read for that matter, Book 3 then you will enjoy Book 4 even more. It  picks up right off where Book 3 left off. What is Sirius Black up to these  days? Who really is going to be Harry's new girlfriend? And the one close  to Harry who dies, well, I won't give it away, but I will say that you will  be thinking one thing, and then totally surprised by who it really is!<br />I  commend J.K. Rawling on her best book yet, and can't wait for the movie in  2001 or Book 5 to see where Harry Potter ends up next!<br />So whether your an  adult who is hiding their love for the series or a child who has gotten a  real thrill for reading recently, then you should order this book ASAP!
