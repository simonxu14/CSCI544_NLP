Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix picks up where Goblet of Fire left off:  Voldemort has returned and those in the wizarding world are divided among those who believe He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back, and those who don't. Most of the nearly 900 pages revolve around this plot and they fly by as the reader is brought into a world of magic, muggles, secret orders (good and evil), and friendship.<br />The action, as in the other books, is fast paced and entertaining. Harry and company get into one adventure after another and all the old characters return. The intrigue builds gradually to the exciting climax that is the last 100 pages. The book is not as dark as Goblet was (the graveyard scene) but has an overall more tense, urgent feeling. Harry has seen death and has lost much of his innocence. The lightness of the previous books is all but gone.  And yes, as Rowling has revealed in interviews, Book 5 sees the death of a major character.<br />The reader is given a lot of answers to pressing questions from previous books. (Dont' worry: I won't include any spoilers in this review.)  Why do some people become ghosts? Just how much does Snape hate Harry's father?  Why don't the Dursleys kick Harry out if they hate him so much?  And perhaps most pressing: WHY did Voldemort want baby Harry dead?<br />We are left feeling that the final two books will be dark and intense: The last chapter is entitled, "The Second War Begins," and it gives an ominous prophecy about Harry's destiny. But we are also left anxiously awaiting books 6 and 7 to find out the fate of everyone's favorite Boy Who Lived....
