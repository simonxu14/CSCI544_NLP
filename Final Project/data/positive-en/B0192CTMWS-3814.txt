An absolutely wonderful book. About 85% of what JK wrote I knew would occur after following the other books (ie - Snape - Dumbledore's no dummy!) I loved the epilogue and expect more books about the next generation in the future (I hope).  I like how she also through in the part about Teddy Lupin and Victoire (you know that Bill and Fleur had a girl) I notice in Book 7 that Scholastic did not "Americanize" this book as much as the others - which I am very thankful for.
