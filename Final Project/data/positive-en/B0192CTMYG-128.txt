After hearing nothing but "Harry Potter" from my nine-year-old grandson,I decided to read the first book in the series so I would be reasonably informed as to the definition of "Muggles" and "Mudbloods".Thus being able to hold a somewhat intelligent "Harry Potter" related conversation with him.  I must say that I was pleasantly surprised that a book so designed for children could be equally entertaining to adults. Ms.Rowling weaves an imaginative tale that virtually comes to life in your mind's eye.  Her writing style is smooth and easy to read and the pages seem to turn themselves.  Upon reading the series I found many new frontiers to explore with my grandson and found him to be a pleasure in book review discussions.  The Harry Potter series is highly recommended and I implore you to turn your imagination loose and see where it takes you!
