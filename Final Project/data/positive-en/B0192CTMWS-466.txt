The final book in the Harry Potter series ties up a lot of loose ends and shows how Harry finally defeats Lord Voldemort.  But first, Harry must die!  J. K. Rowling has created characters that are easily identified with and how people need to stand up to evils even when it's not popular or they are under duress.  A perfect ending to the saga.
