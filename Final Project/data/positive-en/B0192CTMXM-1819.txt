It seems almost ridiculous to be writing this review.  There are over 1,700 others ahead of me and if you are already a Harry Potter fan, then you know how wonderful this book is going to be; and if you are one of those who believe that the series is evil, then that's exactly what you are going to assume this book will be, without even reading it!  As with the previous two books, I loved every single page - I still can't believe how totally wrapped up I can be in what is essentially a childrens' series.  It's magical, it's mystical, it's fun - hey, it's Harry!
