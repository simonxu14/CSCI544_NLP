&quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; lives up to all the hype of the media and expectations readers have after reading the first three books. It is still very well written and very exciting. This episode of the Harry Potter saga  is much longer than the previous tales (743 pages), so we get experience a  much more detailed idea of what it is like to live as a wizard or a witch.  Harry even spends the first several chapters at the Quidditch World Cup  with the Weasleys, so not all of the book (or the plot) revolves around  life at Hogwarts.<br />The characters are growing up, and as such are getting  much more mature. While the development of the characters leads us into the  typical realm of adolescence (ie: boys &amp; girls, dances, etc.), it also  marks a point where we realise our fictional friends are stronger, so  expect a more powerful battle between the forces of good and the forces of  evil. Expect &quot;The Goblet of Fire&quot; to be much darker then your  previous journeys into Harry's world. Don't expect to find only magic  flavored jellybeans and practical jokes, also expect fear, mutilation, and  death. &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; has a much more realistic and heart felt  ending than what you will be expecting, just keep in mind that this is all  pivital to the overall plot of the seven book series.<br />In case I have you  completely down about the dark side of the new book, I might as well  mention that we do get to see Sirius and the loveable little Dobby, as well  as some of Dobby's new elf friends.
