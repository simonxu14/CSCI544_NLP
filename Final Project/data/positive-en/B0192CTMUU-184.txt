Usually, when a sequel is promoted as heavily as the 4th Harry Potter novel, it cannot possibly live up to the hype.  But by including some new characters and challenges, and leaving others out,  J.K.Rowling has managed  to keep the 4th (and longest) book in the series feeling fresh.  The  Goblet of Fire puts Harry and his friends into deeper danger then ever  before.  The number of challenges put in front of Harry in this book makes  the dangers he faced in the first three seem pale in comparison.  In this  installment, more questions are answered about the rise of You-Know-Who's  power.  A clearer picture emerges as to why everyone is so terrified of  ever seeing  his powers return.  Harry Potter remains the humble hero, and  he has matured at 14, but in a way that children of all ages can still  relate to.  Just as with the first three, this book was impossible to put  down.  The ending to Goblet of Fire leaves you with a sense that the  next book will bring even more danger to Harry and his companions.  I am  already looking forward to it!
