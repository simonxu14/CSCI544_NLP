I will always love Harry Potter. I will pass it on when I die. Harry is a classic no matter what haters say. I read a poor review about how the ending was horrible because it relied on Snape explaining missing pieces. That was that part of the review in a nutshell; I thought it was a work of genious on Rowling's part. You haters only write on here because you know how we feel about the books. O'Reilly thought that Rowling is a provacateur; I think most of you haters are provacateurs. Provacative words are not bad in themselves; however, you persoanlly assault me in this case. Harry is the Boy Who Lived, Jo is the Woman Who Lived, and the stories are the Books that Lived. They--the books and the characters--lived. All of the deaths were personal to me as if family or friends died. My friends. Millions of people shared these friendships.
