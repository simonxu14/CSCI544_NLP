Simply stated, this 5th installment of the notable Harry Potter series is the darkest, most gothic, and yet most humourous one yet. Once again, the author, J. K. Rowling balances "scariness" with her wonderful sprinklings of mirth.  This book shows just how clever a writer Rowling can be.<br />One thing though :  the beginning is a bit lengthy, but very informative, and by the end of this voluminous novel, the reader is simply screaming for more!  Perfectly delightful.  Lots of hidden nooks-and-crannies are revealed to the reader.<br />As a final word, I thought the 'Hogwarts Queue' who were waiting for Harry at King's Cross Station [in the final chapter] was positively smashing.  David Beckham could not handle a football better than the way Rowling portrayed the closing scene.  She has scored a brilliant and decisive win!
