Okay, I just like to say that to tick off those who haven't read the book yet.<br />The final book has wrapped things up nicely. Thoroughly enjoyed 9/10's of the book. Kind of dragged in parts, but Rowling mostly kept me glued to the book into the wee hours of the night. Blurrey eyed and sleepy for the three days of plowing through the book were worth it. The last 200 pages were thrilling. Rowling did not disappoint.<br />Spoiler: Potter dies...
