I grew up reading Harry Potter and i will gladly admit to anyone that i am very much a potterhead. So when i got pregnant about 6 years ago i was already so excited about when my daughter got to 6 that i would be able to read these books to her. When i found out that they were coming out with the illustrated version i was so excited. I finally had the chance to order it and when it got here i was so amazed by the artwork. The fact that there is artwork every few pages makes it easier to keep my daughters attention. I think i'm probably enjoying it more but the quality of the pages and the artwork is just mind blowing and worth every penny.
