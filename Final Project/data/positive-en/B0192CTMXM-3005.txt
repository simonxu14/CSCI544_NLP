Harry Potter's 5th book was a long awaited event for most of all his fans, but this book was... well.. not as good as espected. I won't say it hasn't anything going for it, as a matter of fact, I read it in one week. It's long though, but you keep glued to it. The new characters that Rowling introduces to us in this book are some what lame, except for Dolores Umbridge, a really nauseating and horrible person, who at some times, you even want to get inside Hogwarts and jinx her BAD! The writing style is a little weary, some times it goes on too long with out any excitement and it seems a bit dull, but some times it has too much excitement, I think that a mid point would've been better. Overall it's a good book, but some of it's highlignts (like the personality of Cho and her realtionship with Harry, the rude attitudes of Harry, and the uneventful death at the end) leave the reader much to be desired, I think that Rowling could've done better. Well... let's hope that the folowing books get better, 'cause the way the stroy is unfolding, I think that she has a lot of future material to write about, let's hope it doesn't turn out as average as this one. It's a good book, read it, you'll enjoy it, but don't espect too much. I still liked the other four books better. Anyway... at the end you keep wondering (as in all previous books) how are things going to turn out next, as now everyone in the wisarding world knows that Voldemort's back and strong as ever. Well I think we'll have to wait for book six and see...
