The writing is in the spare style of a script, not the lush with details style of the Harry Potter novels. Perhaps at some later point there may be a novelization of Fantastic Beasts, but this isn't that animal. So if you liked the movie, you may like this copy of the script. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, however.
