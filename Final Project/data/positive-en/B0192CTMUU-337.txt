"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire", the fourth Harry Potter book, begins a change in the mood of the series.<br /><br />For the first time, we see a larger picture of the world of the wizards-- we see both good and evil portrayed, and we see the actions of the evil and how it effects the innocent.  The story turns significantly darker, and such topics as torture, terror, and murder are all prevelent in the book.  In short, it's not quite as innocent and unassuming as the first three books.<br /><br />What it is though is fantastically well written, with the characters developing far more depth and developing the first real stirrings of romantic feelings, as naive and innocent as they may be.  J.K. Rowling again manages to construct a page-turner-- keeping the pace fast, the prose reasonably light, and the story quite interesting.  I dinged this one a star because it feels a bit disjoint and there are elements of the story that seem to be a bit less focused and essential than others-- everything felt critical in the first three books, but parts of this don't.<br /><br />Nonetheless, it's a superb book, but it's the first one in the Harry Potter series I'd think that parents should definitely read before their children to make sure they feel it's altogether appropriate-- it is significantly darker and may be harder to deal with for younger children.
