While I would have preferred to be able to purchase this as a digital download (a format the other books in the series are available in), this CD set meets the need.  Fantastically narrated, this is a great way for couples/families to read a book together.  And, of course, anyone looking at the last book in this series already knows this is an excellent series and story.
