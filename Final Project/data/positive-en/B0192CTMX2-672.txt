I have read every single one of J.K. Rowling's books in the Harry Potter series and the last one is by far, the best of the 7 books.  To see the battle between good and evil, Harry and Voldemort come to a conclusion was very exciting and satisfying.  Spending the last twelve years with these characters, I was sad to see it end but what an ending.  J.K. Rowling did not disappoint.
