Harry Potter's amazing journey comes to an end in this book, and JKR has done the series justice in a splendid conclusion.  Good does triumph over evil, though not without cost, and Harry triumphs over his doubts and fears. (No spoilers here!  Read the book.)  The plot takes some unexpected twists and turns, though I was sorry not to see more of certain much-loved characters who do not appear until the last chapters.  The core coming-of-age story of a hero who is willing to die to protect his friends is brilliantly told and extremely satisfying.<br /><br />Bravo!
