It is a rarity in our world that a single event (like the release of the first book in this series)creates an instant of such monumental clarity that all generations are touched by that event. Harry Potter has done just  that in my family. I hope he's done that in yours as well.<br />The Goblet of  Fire is longer and more darkly crafted than the earlier three Harry Potter  books. J.K Rowling takes Harry and crew through a quest that encompasses  every major life passage associated with adolescence.<br />Harry Potter, his  friends, his boarding school--Hogwarts, the awful Dursley family that  provided food &amp; shelter &amp; little else during Harry's first  decade--all have returned in the fourth installment of this seven books  series.<br />Harry is joined by a few new characters.These characters are as  richly drawn as the old familiar ones. My family is anxiously awaiting the  return of several of these.Of the old friends, Hermione is as usual  maturing a step or two ahead of her two best friends, Harry &amp; Ron. Ron  struggles with his own awkward acknowledgement of some unpleasant emotions  and the Weasley family begins taking a more active part in nurturing  Harry's yearning for &quot;family&quot;. Hagrid is faced with some complex  and unexpected challenges of his own. His courage and honesty expressed  while faced with an unpredictable new relationship makes him all the more  endearing.<br />My family loved the fuller development of shy &amp; clumsy  Neville and the strength of character displayed by Sirius Black.<br />I won't  be surprised  by backlash from families that might be disturbed by the  presence of death, evil &amp; violence. It will be unfortunate if readers'  expectations hold Harry &amp; all to a more simplified &amp; politically  correct story line. Bottom line here--like it or not--Harry's world is  often a reflection of our own &amp; we live in a world of violence. We're  surrounded by dysfunctional families--(we might even &lt;horrors&gt; be  part of a dysfunctional family!)<br />The Goblet of Fire spans 734 pages and  it aptly traces the roots, branches &amp; yes even some stagnant, rotting  stumps on several family trees.<br />The theme of the Goblet of Fire centers  around just such breakdowns in family units &amp; the Hope for the future  when characters (and real people) break the chains of destruction, inertia,  denial &amp; apathy &amp; they boldly create new family structures that DO  function.<br />In the fourth installment Harry is called to face the most  difficult challenge in his young life, when an unknown entity enters his  name in a dangerous global competition that spans the school year and is  open to participants aged 17 &amp; older. Although Harry is much younger  than the other contestants he must participate--although the consequesences  might very well be deadly.<br />Harry's strongest character traits;  compassion, self-confidence, nobility and fairness are becoming traits he  more firmly relies on when faced with insurmountable odds. It is with these  traits, his friends and the family he's fashioned that Harry must confront  and triumph against his most evil enemy.
