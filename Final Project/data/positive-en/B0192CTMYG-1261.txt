I never imagined as a then 23 year old woman that I would enjoy Harry Potter.  I thought the book was just a fad, and I've never been one to follow fads.  But then, one day, I saw the Harry Potter movie when I was coherced into going by my sister-in-laws, and I actually thought it was great!  And so, I went and got the book to see if the book measured up to the movie.  I was blown away.<br />The plot is intricate and the characters are loveable, once you get to know them.  It seems that there is at least one character in the world of Harry Potter you can relate to.  Hermione who is the geek and not very popular child who comes from a classic suburban lifestyle, Ron who is the friendly but poor kid who comes from a very loving family, and then there is Harry who is your typical child from a completely disfunctional family (even if he is an orphan).  All three kids are alienated to one degree or another from their fellow children and I think all people, children and grown-ups alike can relate to not fitting in at one time or the other.<br />I would recommend getting these books and reading them all.  They get better as the books go on, but the first one still holds a special place in my heart because it is the start of the entire series and contains, in my opinion, the most magic and innocence of youth (which is a fun read).  If you get these books I do not think you'll ever be disappointed.
