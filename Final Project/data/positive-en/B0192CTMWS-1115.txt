It was long-awaited and  anticipated by millions of people around the globe, and it was amazing. I sobbed throughout the chapter 32, and I'm not ashamed because the book was exquisite. J.K.R. rounded down everything she previously mentioned in the other books, and Harry himself is somewhat different, he striked me as someone who suddenly grew up in a very positive kind of way. To all those who haven't yet read this final piece of the most magical book ever, I envy you.
