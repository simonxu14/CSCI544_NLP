I have seen and read all the books and movies. Unless a movie is 7 hours there will always be scenes and particular items left out of movies in order to carry the movie along. But with the entire HP series I feel most of the heart is captured on screen. This particular book wasn't the most action packed or world shaking but it did its job in setting up the feeling of being alone and lost in order to mature young Harry for the next book and what happens to Dumbledore.
