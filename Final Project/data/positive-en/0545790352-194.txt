Granted I am one of those crazy fans who collects anything HP. I ordered this book and was so happy I did. The characters have been brought to life. I was amazed at the attention of detail. I had heard it was coffee table size...not really thinking about it the book is huge. I had to clerk off a special shelf to keep it on. Needless to say I will be getting all of them. I highly recommend whether you are a crazy fan like me or you are introducing the series to a grandchild/child. It's good for adults too.
