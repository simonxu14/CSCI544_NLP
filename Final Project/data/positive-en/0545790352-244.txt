Though I own all of the HP books already, I just had to have this version. The paper is of superb quality, and you can feel its density as you turn its page. The art stayed pretty true to the aesthetic the movie adopted, but had just enough original portrayal to give the book a whole new experience. The drawings are whimsical and pleasing, not childish, making it perfect for adult readers. My only complaint is that I would have liked even more drawings instead of one every few pages.
