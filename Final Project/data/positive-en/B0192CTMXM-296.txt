At the time of this review many have not yet finished reading the book, and no one wants the plot given away. Therefore I will comment only generally.<br /><br />As one of those readers who has followed Harry Potter from the beginning to the very end, I am very satisfied with this conclusion to the Harry Potter saga. The reader has watched Harry mature through each of the books until he reaches a point at which he has matured beyond the level usually achieved by a seventeen year old. While there are a few touches of the humor of the first book, each of the books has become progressively more serious, and this culmination of the Harry Potter approaches the epic nature of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />J.K. Rowling is a great storyteller, and she has tried very hard to wind up all of the loose ends of the Harry Potter saga in this book. I like this the best of all her books, and I hope that she will continue to write, although it is clear that she doesn't want to write more about Harry. Rowling has deepened the meaning of her story and she has achieved a more resonant work in this book than in all of the past books.<br /><br />Thumbs up on this book!
