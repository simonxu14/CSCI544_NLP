This book arrived Saturday afternoon and I finished reading it early Sunday morning.  I would have to say that this book is the best yet in an excellent series.  The writing has become significantly more sophisticated to parallel Harry's maturation.  The issues (love, death, etc.) have also become more sophisticated as well.  If you liked the first four books, you'll love this one.
