I was SO impressed with this story!! After having read the entire series, I was very pleased at how Rowling tied all the stories together so neatly. I also thought it was clever of her to leave just a teensie bit of leeway in terms of an opening for future related works. Although, I have a suspicion that nothing she will do after this phenominal modern classic. I highly recommend this book to all Potter fans. You won't be disappointed.
