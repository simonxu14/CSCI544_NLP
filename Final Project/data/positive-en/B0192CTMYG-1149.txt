I started working in the daycare system when I was seventeen years old. When I was nineteen, I started working with elementary age children on a daily basis. I get them off their buses and entertain them, while they entertain me. When you're around kids this much, you learn what they like, and they scream Harry Potter quite loudly. Late in 2002, I ordered "The Sorcerer's Stone" off Amazon just to see what all the buzz was about.<br /><br />I had a broken foot at the time, so I had some free time on my hands. I literally read this book cover to cover in nine hours. I could NOT put it down. This book is so well written, that the young and young at heart will enjoy it emmencely. JK Rowling can write in the voice of a child and the voices of adults. She captures the essence of a child in the voices of her main characters, Harry, Hermione and Ron but can still write menacing characters like Professor Snape and Voldemort with the same pen... or perhaps it's a quill.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to all elementary school children and all adults who love good literature. Parents should read this book with their kids... it just might give them something to talk about at the dinner table.
