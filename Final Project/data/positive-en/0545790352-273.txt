I don't know how you could not give this book 5 stars. It has beautiful drawings. It makes me want to read the book over and over again. There is not a single white page... everything has either ink drops or drawings or something. These would be perfect for reading to your children, or letting them read to you (as the case may be). I have already preordered Chamber of Secrets, and I can guarantee you that every other book will be in my collection as they come out. The pages are a nice weight and have a gloss, but not too high of a sheen. This is the full text. The book isn't that thick (but I can't imagine what some of the later books are going to look like since they are so thick anyway). This is the original version. So please keep in mind that though it has been changed from Philosopher to Sorcerer, you may see some other words that are a little more British.
