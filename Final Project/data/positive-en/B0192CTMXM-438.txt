I was so excited to get the book, and yet fearful that every character I loved was at risk with the rumors circulating.  I feel that Rowling did an excellent job in wrapping up the series in a sensitive, yet suspenseful way that stayed true to her themes.  Yes, there are always losses in the battle between good and evil, but good should and does prevail.
