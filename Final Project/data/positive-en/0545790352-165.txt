I cannot write a good enough review for this piece of ART. I'm already a huge Harry Potter fan with JK Rowling being my hero. But to pair with an artist such as Jim Kay? His work is inspiring. You are once again transported, not only through the masterwork of JK Rowling's words, but through the magical images that Jim brings to the book. Each page is carefully drawn and you take each word slowly as if tasting each syllable.<br /><br />This is a pair that won't be beat. Eagerly awaiting the next!
