ahhh well, it feels good to read a 700+ book in like 3 1/2 days....but that's how all harry potter books read, right? just can't seem to put it down?<br />and man i sure did love the book, all the way right to the end. but then, big drop off right at the last chapter. why? because i felt like there ought to be a whole extra chapter in there. or at least a prolonged ending. i mean we spent pages and pages and pages just collecting items, and one thing i really like about rowling's books is that whole roll-out at the end where everything that can be wrapped up will be. but i didn't get that here. there was a big buildup to what i thought was a rather swiftly wrapped up ending, leaving me with the whole "hey did someone rip out some pages in my book?" feeling. okay, we finally know who kicks the bucket and who doesn't, but where is the getting back to normal chapter? that whole, this is what we do to pick up the pieces after all our losses chapter... i mean yea, we get an epilogue, which hey is great, but even THAT felt rushed. it's like rowling finally got to the end of it all, finally gave us the epic battle, then just shrugged and said that's good enough, you fill in the rest (which is just not like her other books!).<br />maybe i'm just in mourning to see the end, i don't know...or maybe she did just get tired, i know i would be...however, i would have happily waited a couple of more months for just a few more pages. that's just me.
