I was so excited when I heard they were coming out with illustrated versions of my absolute favorite book series.  Illustrations are gorgeous and lush (though there were a few missed opportunities, imo) and I love the portraits scattered throughout (more of Draco, please!).  I can't imagine how big the later novels are going to be, considering the length of the text-only books, but I can't wait!
