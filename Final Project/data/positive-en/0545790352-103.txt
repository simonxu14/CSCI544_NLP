This book is excellent! I love the Harry Potter books, and really wanted my daughter to get into them. She has been reading chapter books, but only interested in the ones that have some sort of pictures. So far, she loves it as much as I do!<br />  The pictures in this boo are very colorful, and even the pages with just writing have some interesting blotches and such. The characters that are drawn here are more like how I pictured them than the movie. All in all I'd say this was a great buy, and I can't wait for them to do the rest!!
