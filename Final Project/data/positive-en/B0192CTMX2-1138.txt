OK, here we go:  Unlike the four previous harry potter books, the first three especially, there is a lot of action right at the start, even before hogwarts.  This is by far the longest and best book, as there is a lot of action, a lot of plotting, a lot of laughs, and a lot of mystery.  You might think that the book is trying to be too many things at once, but it's not.  It has a perfect blend of all good aspects of a book.  You'll love it!
