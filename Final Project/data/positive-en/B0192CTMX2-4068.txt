I have read every book, seen every movie and am still in awe.  I finished the entire book within hours of receiving it, I was gripped in the land of magical people, back with friends, enemies and classmates.  I was in a world where some things were not as they seemed, but then some things were exactly as they seem.<br />I will not give out any plot points but to say, as many others have said, that Ms Rowling ties up all loose ends, answers all questions and ends the series in the only way that made any sense to people who have stuck with the series.  I agree with others that this book is darker than the others, but anybody who has read the series knows that each book gets progressively darker and more violent.  At the end of book 6 a war was starting, at the start of book 7 the war has begun.<br />I think it would be a good idea for anybody to reread the series from beginning to end, put aside a block of time and just reread it.  I think that this is one of the most amazing series ever.  I think you will too.  Anybody who gave this less than 4 - 5 stars just, probably doesn't understand.
