The order is a great group of characters i most enjoyed reading about.  I think i can relate to the schools turmoil by remembering my time in high school.  My high school felt like prison... only hogwarts was worse... a nightmare i think.  I found the cat lady very annoying and enjoyed her end in the forest.  My favorite part was when Fred and George set off one of their Swamp traps in one of the corridors and no one knew how to clean it up.  Classic juvenile delinquincy.  Lol...
