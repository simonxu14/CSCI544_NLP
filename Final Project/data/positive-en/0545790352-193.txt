I had high expectations for this and they were absolutely met. This book is gorgeous and high quality. The paper is thick and glossy, the book as a whole is heavy in weight - just picking it up you can feel the quality. I am so impressed with this and just truly hope the rest of the books follow this format and remain this beautiful. I love the illustrations and having yet another way to imagine the Wizarding World. The only illustration I feel is missing, is a Christmas one. There are only pictures of the chess pieces and I was really hoping to see the Great Hall or common room all decorated. That is simply something to hope for in the future installments!<br />If you're on the fence, buy it! If you have never read the series this is a beautiful way to be introduced. It also makes a lovely coffee table book.
