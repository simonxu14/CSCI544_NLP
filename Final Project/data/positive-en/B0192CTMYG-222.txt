This book definitely lives up to all the movie and media hype. J.K. Rowling is brilliant and Stephen Fry is thrilling. We decided to listen to these on audio-book while driving, cleaning and working, watching the first movie afterwards. The storyline is engaging and enthralling from the beginning. Magic begins almost immediately, quickly pulling the audience into the mysterious life of Harry Potter. Stephen Fry is capable of a wide range of voices; just when you think he can't possibly read as another new character, he excitingly does it. We worried we might be too old to enjoy this series, but Rowling is such a genius author that she writes at a level enjoyable to all ages. Bravo! Read this book and then watch the coinciding film. The movies never please every fan, especially the hardcore ones, but it's always great to see the characters come to life in cinema.
