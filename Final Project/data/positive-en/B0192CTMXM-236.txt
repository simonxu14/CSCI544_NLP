AWESOME!!!<br /><br />As far as final books go, Rowling has outdone herself. Mind you I would have liked more after story of the gang, but, isn't that what Fan Fic is for? Now the fanfic writers can take off from where J.K. left off. Just a sheer delight to read, I could not put it down till I was done. A must read for any Potter fan!
