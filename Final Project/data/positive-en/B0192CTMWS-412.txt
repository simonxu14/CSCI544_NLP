I was given a lot of slack for reading this by my Christian friends.  But all in all, Harry Potter and friends are much more respectable than kids are today.  They have manners they are taught.  I enjoyed all six books.  I wish I had the tablet to read them on back when I read them all.  I miss Harry Potter stories.  I wish they had continued on and on.  It is the books that got me back into reading.
