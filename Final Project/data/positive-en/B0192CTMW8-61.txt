Harry Potter and Chamber of secrets is a great follow-up to ...Sorcerer's Stone. My granddaughters and I are enjoying reading the series together. However, I would not want to purchase the &#34;...School Library&#34; editions for future HP books, It's more like a paperback with a thicker cover. Pages loosen, and the feel of the book is less that I expected.
