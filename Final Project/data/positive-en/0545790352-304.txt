This book is amazing. The illustrations are wonderful and perfect, and somehow managed to capture the characters and places exactly how I imagined them when I first read the book 18 years ago. (Ok, that is ridiculous and how is it even possible it has been that long?) They don't seemed to be influenced by the movies, and that is part of what makes it so so wonderful. Everyone who is a fan of Harry Potter should own a copy. I cannot wait until the later books come out.
