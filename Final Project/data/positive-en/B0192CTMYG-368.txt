You don't have to be in the 9-12 age group to enjoy HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE. I read it in one day in between meal preparation and clean-up and dragging the sprinkler around the garden. I had to see what  happened next. I'm an avid reader of books by Robert B. Parker, Sue  Grafton, Nevada Barr, Doug Allyn, Maeve Binchy, and tons of other fiction  and non-fiction adult writers. J. K. Rowling has now been added to my list  of favorites and I'm more than 4 times 12! Can't imagine anyone being  disappointed by this book no matter what their age.
