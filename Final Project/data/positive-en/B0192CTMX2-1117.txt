Although I had already read the book, when my daughters were listening to these tapes I found myself listening in.  Once again these tapes are beautifully done and really capture J.K. Rowling's story, and characters.  Many hours of listening pleasure, great for long car rides, if played at night my children wouldn't sleep until they were done.  Just be careful if you are listening and driving, you'll start paying more attention to the tapes than the road.  A great set.
