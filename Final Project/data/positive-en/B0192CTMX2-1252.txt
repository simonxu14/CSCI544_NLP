These books engage me. They are morality tales for our age and yet remain hugely entertaining. This fifth installment does not fail to reel in the reader's mind and heart on a variety of levels. In the end, it is not about wizards and magic, but about the very hard decisions we all make (or don't make) in life. Rowling has done a great service to us all.
