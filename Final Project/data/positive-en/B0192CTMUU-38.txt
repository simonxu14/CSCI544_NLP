When you realize the Wizarding World isn't Neverland...<br /><br />The Goblet of Fire introduces the Quidditch World Cup and Death Eaters are the WORST party crashers, the TriWizard Tournament, we get to learn about a Penseive which is an awesome concept. If you watched the movie you can picture The Doctor as a baddie, and Hufflepuff's Cedric Diggory as that Twilight guy whose vampire name I genuinely can't remember and I'm actually laughing out loud about it.<br /><br />Oh and for Potterheads: The password is still Lemon Drop. (Sherbet Lemon for the Brits).
