From the first few pages I knew we were in for a treat and that Rowling would truly amaze us with this her last effort in the Harry Potter series.  I was not disappointed.  Where the first 6 books showed some action and hinted at a ton more, this 7th book packed the action in virtually every chapter.  I will not reveal any of the plot, although virtually everyone probably knows it by now, but I will say that the raw emotions and feelings that this book evoke are just amazing.<br /><br />Some authors drag on their series and end up writing horribly by the end, having used up their stock of scenes.  Rowling certainly finished her series with a bang and a flourish and showed us really and truly why her series have sold so many books.  Not only did she write well but the plot and storylines present through all the books came through and tied up perfectly.  For this I am grateful, not only for her writing, but for what she was able to do in creating something so powerful that millions of people, people that would otherwise not read, would read, talk and become excited.<br /><br />The Deathly Hallows is her best book by far.  You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />5 stars
