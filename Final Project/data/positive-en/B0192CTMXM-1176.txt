My husband does not like to read so we ventured into audio books as an alternative.  This audio book (and all in the Harry Potter series) is THE BEST! We truly enjoy the Harry Potter audio books because the narrator Jim Dale is so fantastic.  He does all the different character voices so well and really makes the story come to life.  These books are good for the whole family- especially on a long car ride!
