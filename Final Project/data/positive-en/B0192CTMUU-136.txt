I love all of the Harry Potter books. If you haven't read them give it try. These are very engaging, wonderfully descriptive books. Created by the brilliant words displayed upon each page you are allowed to travel into the wizarding world alongside Harry.  Pick up one of these books for a good read and stay for the amazing adventure. Thank you J.K. Rowling.
