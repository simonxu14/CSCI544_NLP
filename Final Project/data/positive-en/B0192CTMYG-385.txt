Although I have read the books many times, as a sewing crafter I spend hours at my sewing machine and thoroughly enjoy listening to books. The narrator of this series is fantastic!! You can take an excellent book and totally changed or corrupt the characters with a bad narrator, but that is not at all the case in this series. So if you've got too much to do to sit and read, take the time to listen. You will truly enjoy it!!  Kathy
