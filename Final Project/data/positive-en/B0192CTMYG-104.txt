If you haven't heard of Harry Potter-you've been under a rock-read these books! A defining series of my generation-and obviously I love it! This is just the beginning of Harry's story, so it is very light hearted writing (although as an adult you can see more mature content you didn't see as a kid i.e. prejudice, child abuse, etc.), but as the story continues in the following books, the writing gets heavier. I have re-read the story multiple times in my youth and adult life, and I am always happy that I did. I purchased the kindle version so I could carry the series with me anywhere I go! Fun and easy read for adults, great underlying ideas for children (friendship, family, love, respect...) all wrapped up in a fun story about a boy wizard! Again, seriously, read this series if you haven't!
