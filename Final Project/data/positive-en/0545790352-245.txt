I was writing why I considered giving this a three star review when my Crookshank tailed cat attackd my phone.  My gosh. Is doing it again!<br /><br />So quickly. Dinged a star because is printed in two column format ( like a Bible or textbook). Do not like reading that way.<br /> Perhaps if you are a long time HP fan another one or two stars off because illustrations won't go with pictures already formed in your brain.  Did not deduct because a first time reader would love<br /><br />Almost did not preorder next book because of two column format.<br /><br />Off before Crookshank relative kills this review again!
