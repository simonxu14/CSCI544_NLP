Well, who could argue with the 2000 reviews before me. However, when one reads this they will know exactly how perfect this story is. Harry Potter and his unknown past abot his parents and his &quot;evil&quot; aunt and  uncle who raise him. Well told in an easy format for anyone to enjoy, kids  and adults alike. Potter being the most likeable character to come around  in some time. From start to finish, this book is one to be treasured for  quite some time. Reccommended for Everyone!
