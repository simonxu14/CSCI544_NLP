First off, let me say I loved this series.  I started reading it aloud to my children after becoming aware of "Harry Potter" after publication of the 2nd book.  My kids bailed on the series after book #4 but alas I was hooked and pre-ordered them as soon as it was possible to do so.  I felt the book got off to a good start - then pretty much came to a standstill - but did finally get back on track and then what a sweet ride to the end.  I would give the book 3.5 stars if possible but was closer to a 4 than a 3 - and the overall series I give a 5.  J.K. Rowling managed to capture adults as well as children in this series - she made us laugh, she made us cry - and most of all she introduced us to some characters we will never forget.
