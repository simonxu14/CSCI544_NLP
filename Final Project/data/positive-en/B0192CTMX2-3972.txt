With all the hype and hysteria surrounding this book, I really expected it to be a disappointment.  It wasn't.  I'm a fan of the books and movies (although I'm not a freaky, dress up in character, kind of fan), and I've enjoyed most of them.  The darker the story got, however, the less I enjoyed it.  I expected this one to be pretty dark, and it was in spots, but it certainly redeemed itself.  I enjoyed it tremendously.
