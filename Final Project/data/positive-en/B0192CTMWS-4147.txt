The final installment of the Harry Potter series is finally here and although at fist I didn't like the book and I was upset it was the end I came to my senses. The book was fantastic, from the very beginning when I was confused as to what was going on, till the final battle at Hogwarts where I bawled hysterically. I will admit the Epilogue was not my favorite but overall this book cleaned up a lot of the loose ends and I was more then happy to read about Snape and Dumbledore's amazing pasts.
