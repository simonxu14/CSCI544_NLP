After some 1100 reviews, I was loath to add my contribution, thinking it would be like bringing coals to Newcastle. Having read some of the reviews, however, I am somewhat heartened to read that not every review is a five-star love letter either to The Hallows, to author Rowling or to the series as a whole.<br /><br />As to the observation Rowling needed a stricter editor for this final (some say, bloated) novel in the Harry Potter saga, it's debatable.  However, I take strong exception to one review that labeled Dumbledore a "fraud" with the demand that Dumbledore "be the same as he was throughout the series," or words to that effect.<br /><br />The key aspect that comes from "HP and the Deathly Hallows" is the human fallibility of all the characters. I suppose it's easy to forget -- considering readers are submerged into the wizarding world -- that Harry and all the other characters (save the fantastic giants, centaurs, and such) are still HUMAN, magical but human. As such, Dumbledore, Harry, even Professor Snape are prone to human weakness, petty jealousies, and even acts of extraordinary courage. Readers are treated to the fact that a young, callow Dumbledore was elitist, selfish, and power-hungry. A young Snape seems to have loved only one woman -- the woman he couldn't have -- all his life. Who'd have suspected that the dour Snape had such a romantic nature?<br /><br />Yet the adult Dumbledore is so easy to love, to trust. The adult Snape is so easy to hate, to hold in suspicion. In "Deathly Hallows" Rowling points out that all is never as it seems on the surface - a lesson we might apply in our real daily lives.<br /><br />For this reader, the charm of the novel is finally revealing the feet of clay that all the principal characters possess. More than a tale of wizardry and the eternal battle of good vs. evil, Rowling has painted vivid portraits of the vagaries of human nature, by turns magnanimous then niggardly, cowardly then courageous.
