We have just received our Harry Potter tapes and CDs for the third book, Prisoner of Azkaban.  Though it would hardly seem possible, each one gets better and better.  I was delighted tonight to read that the first Harry  Potter audiobook has been nominated for a Grammy award--it is always  gratifying to see a nomination for something that actually deserves an  award.  The voices and the expression of Jim Dale, the reader, are  priceless, and add new dimensions to the book, even if you have already  read it more than once. We listen as a family, and all of the neighbors  clamor to drive everywhere with us!  This activity brings back the joys of  reading together that we used to have when I was a little girl. There is  nothing as wonderful on the market today as the Harry Potter books, and the  audio versions are spectacular.  I look forward to each and every one of  them as eagerly as my daughter--aand we depend upon Amazon to bring them to  us first!
