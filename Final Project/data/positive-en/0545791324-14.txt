It really really is. I am purchasing each of these as they come out so my daughter will be interested in them in a few years. I have to say, they are so beautiful I am considering ordering a second set (one for me and one for her!). If you are a Potter fan, you will LOVE the illustrated editions. Jim Kay really brings the books to life with his beautiful illustrations.
