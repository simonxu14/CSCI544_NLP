It's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  Illustrated.<br /><br />That should be enough by itself.  But I feel like I should add more to the review.  I won't speak to the text, since that is so well known already.<br /><br />The book is larger - much bigger than either the paperbacks or hardbacks of the HP books.  Think more coffee table sized books.  Almost every page has some sort of &#34;decorative&#34; image, and at least every 2-3 pages has an illustration.  Some are small, just sketches in the corner.  Some are full page (or full two pages), gorgeously done illustrations.<br /><br />The illustrator was influenced slightly by previous art and the movies, but also is able to put his own spin on it.  The result is a book of unique yet utterly faithful and instantly recognizable illustration of beloved characters and stories.  The book also comes with a fabric bookmark.<br /><br />I already have 2-3 copies of the HP books, yet I had to get this when it came out. I will probably buy another copy to read with my son when he is a few years older.
