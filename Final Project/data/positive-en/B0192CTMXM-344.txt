The Harry Potter series breaks down into two trilogies. It starts with a 3-part children's story about a wizard defeating Voldemort and Voldemort's legacy, and it keeps a strictly fairy-tale tone. The final 3 books tell a young-adult story about a teenager trapped in the middle of a wizarding war. Then, in between, we have the clunky bridge of book 4, but Order of the Phoenix is where Rowling starts to succeed with the ambitious task she really mapped out in the previous installment. It's definitely a tone shift, it features a protagonist who acts more like an adult than a child, and it's much more evenly paced than Goblet of Fire. That said, it's still a bit over-written and I take some issues with the ending.<br /><br />The first time I read it, I was struck (as were we all) by Harry's temper and how it undermined him as a sympathetic character. This time through it bothered me less. Harry's main personal conflict is that he has to finally see that the world is larger than himself and that the conflicts are more complicated than "who's right and who's wrong". That is, there's politics to contend with. And that's where I start to take issue with the ending, and here's why:<br /><br />[SPOILERS]<br /><br />Harry's unwillingness to listen to his superiors, his brash need to be the hero, leads him to go charging into the Ministry of Magic blindly and ultimately results in the death of his godfather. But he doesn't learn from this. He's angry at himself, but as soon as he gets back to the school, Dumbledore sits him down and apologizes to him for not keeping him well-enough informed. Harry was just starting to grow, to learn that actions have consequences. But then he settles back into righteous anger.<br /><br />[END SPOILERS]<br /><br />All that said, it's better than I remember. It's fairly exciting, it features a great villain in Dolores Umbridge, and it's definitely an improvement over book 4. But while the scope has widened, the temperament has not. In a wizarding war with the fate of the world at stake, we're still devoting a lot of page-inches to the Quidditch House Cup. The main plot muscles on, but the subplots meander greatly and don't really contribute to the characters or the story all that much (what purpose did Grawp serve, seriously?) and despite being 5 books in, we're still spending a good chunk of time setting up for sequels.
