This book is absolutely beautiful! I loved the Harry Potter series when I first read it (admittedly as a college student!), and I've been trying to get my 9 year old into it - I just knew this would be a series he would love. We got the illustrated version yesterday and I read the first chapter aloud to my kids. Then I found my son later reading the book on his own with no prompting whatsoever. I knew he would love the book, and the illustrations have really helped him get into it. A bunch of words on the page in a thick book can be daunting for a kid his age, and this just made it s much more accessible to him. I think he will have no problem with the other books now.
