What can I say... J.K. has put her heart and soul into keeping the Harry Potter stories intriguing, thrilling, and personal, and has outdone herself in this anxiously-awaited final segment of this unparalleled series.  I loved it, was more than moved throughout the story of the Deathly Hallows, and feel fully satiated and complete.  Thank you, J.K.... you are truly a master for all ages.
