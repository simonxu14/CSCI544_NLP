my daughter's first novel series. she's completely hooked, of course. She is a bit on the sensitive side, so before we started reading it to her (age 6), we explained there were going to be some scary parts, but that Harry would be ok. That helped a lot, as she hasn't complained about it being too scary.  After finishing a book, we let her watch the movie version.
