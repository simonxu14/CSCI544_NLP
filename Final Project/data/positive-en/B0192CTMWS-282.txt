So I've not actually read this yet, I wanted the last two books before I started reading the series (I already had the first five). I have finally started reading the series, I'm on "Year 3" and I'm loving them! I'm reading the book, then my daughter and I are watching that movie, then she reads that book while I start the next one. We are having a blast doing this!! The books just keep getting better and better!!! I highly recommend them.
