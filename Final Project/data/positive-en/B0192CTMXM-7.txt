It is easy to get lured into a false sense of security about the Harry Potter books, as other Amazon reviewers seem to have been lured. While the books share a certain structural similarity, the series is not about a boy going to a magical school to become a wizard. Instead, the series is about the second coming of the dark lord Voldemort, and the destiny of one boy -- Harry Potter -- to one day stop him, or die trying.<br />Nowhere is this more clear than in "The Order of the Phoenix," the fifth book in the series and the darkest to date. Fresh on the heels of a death of a supporting character at the end of the fourth book, the heroes are circling the wagons, operating with a great deal of caution and suspicion as they wait to see what the newly risen Voldemort will do next.<br />But of course, life goes on, especially in a wizarding world where most members of the community refuse to believe that Voldemort has returned and, indeed, the unofficial government line is that Harry is crazy or lying in order to get attention. The presence of a powerful wizard at Hogwarts who believes Harry (headmaster Professor Dumbledore) means that the government intervenes even there, changing the character of the school in order to suppress panic, and as a result, give Voldemort's supporters, the Death Eaters, cover for their clandestine efforts.<br />As always, the series tackles more and more mature and complex issues in each subsequent volume. In "Order of the Phoenix," Harry grapples with the fact that his idealized vision of what his parents were like is just a childish fantasy and, more importantly, that the battle he's been involved in almost since birth is marked by deep shades of gray.<br />"The world is not divided into good people and Death Eaters," his god father, Sirius Black, tells Harry at one point. And so it is that Harry has to battle an antagonist (one of the most cruel and vivid in modern literature) who is bad without being evil, and not a friend while not being an actual enemy.<br />And all the while, Voldemort is waiting in the wings. How he's linked to Harry's mysterious visions and what he wants and why are the central mysteries in this volume, which is much closer to the kids-solving-a-mystery structure of the first three books than "Goblet of Fire" was, and the payoff is immense: Not only do readers finally get to see just why every other character in the series are so impressed with Voldemort and Dumbledore, but the lies and deceptions readers have noticed Harry being fed since the first series are (mostly) torn away at the end, exposing the frightening and tragic shape of things to come.<br />Because the tragedies are not done: It's war, and more beloved figures are going to die. Who, why and how are the questions, but the shadow of death looms over "The Order of the Phoenix," and casts an ominous pall over future volumes. But like the bird for which the group is named, there is a hope at the center of the story, that perhaps, no matter how dark things get, that good will prevail and the light will be reborn, even from the darkness.<br />But darkness is still gathering, and readers who found "Goblet of Fire" too dark be warned: It's going to get a lot darker before the dawn.<br />Strongly recommended for Harry Potter fans, especially those enjoying the battle between good and evil at the heart of the series.
