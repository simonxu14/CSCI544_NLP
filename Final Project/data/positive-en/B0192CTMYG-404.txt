The Harry Potter series is a must read for any age.  I was talked into reading this book by a family member who is a teacher.  Of course, believing this book to be a child's fantasy book, I had no interest in ever reading the series.  However, I finally bought the first, and a month later, I had read all 7 books in the Harry Potter series.  I couldn't put it down.
