As a professional adult I thought that it was crazy when someone recommended this series to me. I thought these books/movie was for children and would in no way captivate an adult. How wrong I was! I love these books and find it hard to put one down! I would tell anyone who is as skeptical as I was to go for it - you won't regret it!
