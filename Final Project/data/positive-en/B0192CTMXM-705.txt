The ending sucked!  I know this review will be lost under the Everest of glowing, five-star positive reviews.  Nevertheless, I thought Rowling did a great job of closing the series, leading up to the final confrontation between Voldemort and Harry.  However, Harry should have died.  Without a doubt, the conversation between himself and Dumbledore could have been the great sorrowful ending I wished for.  Maybe I like Greek trajedy a little too much, but the end of such a terrible evil should be paid for with the lives of some important innocents.  Fred, Tonks, Lupin - they're minor characters.  I wanted Ron or Hermione or at least Harry dead, but Rowling lost her nerve.  She fell under Potter's sway, and he is quite charismatic (just like his dad) but I still have to blame her for that.  For what it's worth, I'll read the next book Rowling puts out because she has a wonderful tone that the reader falls in love with, that will drive someone watching tv to pick up the book and say nothing for hours, rapt in attention to the travails of Harry.  And Snape's memories was a terrific chapter, without it this would be a 3-star review.
