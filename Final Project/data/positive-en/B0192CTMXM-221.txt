I your a Harry Potter Fan I definetley recommend this product. Especially if you plan on taking any cross country trips, kills time like you wouldn't believe. Listened to it from Miami, FL to Portland,OR (3500 miles-6 days). 23 dics total, some of which at the end you can't wait to put the next disc in. Narrorator does a great job on all 140 different voices by himself. Made it easier to listen to than just a simple 1 monatone voice. Definetly recommend this product.
