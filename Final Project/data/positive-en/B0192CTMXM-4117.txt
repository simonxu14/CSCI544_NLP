It would of been so easy for J.K. Rowlings to tie this series end up into a pretty little package. But, she didn't.  She took the hard way, never fearing killing off important side characters to make this book above and beyond the others.  Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone was my first experience with SCI/FI fantasy and with a marketed childerens series.  I was hooked from the first.  What has always intreged me was that she never shied away from making the transition into a more teen/adult novel.  She has let Harry grow up with the kids who started the series at the same age as he.<br />I have read many series type novels and most authors let a stinker or two into the mix.  J.k. Rowling has led her readers from point A to point B with extreme talent.  Not a stinker in the bunch.<br />There is so much in this book that satisfys the reader.  All questions and half assumtions are answered with total respect for the reader. I will be sorry to see Harry go but I will let him go knowing full well were he has gone and some of what his future holds.
