THIS BOOK IS AMAZING! I have been trying for several years to get my young son interested in the HP books, and though I try to read them to him, he gets bored easily and has a hard time getting into them. This book has changed that. We read it every evening at bedtime and he is so excited to read it! The quality is just outstanding! Beautiful colors, very detailed illustrations on almost every page, nice thick paper, very heavy hard cover, beautiful jacket, stamped gold print on the binding of the cover. This is a STEAL for this price! I can't wait for the next one to come out! I will definitely have the entire set!
