When you order this book order it with something else! Anything else! This book is the exact size to fit in Amazons single book shipping box, but its such &#34;perfect&#34; fit that if it gets dropped anywhere along the process (likely) you will get dented book corners and torn dust jacket like I did. I returned mine and had it replaced because why pay full price for something if you get used quality? I had my replacement shipped with another item and it came in a large box perfectly fine!
