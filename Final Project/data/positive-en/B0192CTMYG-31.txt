Possibly the best book of the last 20 years for people of all ages, read by Jim Dale, who was voted best narrator of the year more than once. How could it get any better? J.K. Rowling is nothing short of spectacular. The story is a must read for everyone, and a must listen to twice (it just gets better) Highly entertaining. Amazing. Will teach children and adults many life lessons and make life better while entertaining. Possible one of the very few books that will still be read a thousand years from now (or listened to) Jim Dale is highly talented narrator and he only gets better with books 2 and on. If you only buy one audio book this year , this is the one to buy, even if you've seen the movie.
