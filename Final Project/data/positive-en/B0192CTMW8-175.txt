Ms. Rowling doesn't disappoint!  The key to reading this fantasy series is suspending disbelief.  If, as a reader, you do not, the story becomes predictable and ridiculous.  If you can master that skill, you will be drawn into a magical world of exciting characters and events!  I've never looked forward to anything more!
