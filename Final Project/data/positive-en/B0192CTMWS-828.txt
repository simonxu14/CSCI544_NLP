I'll try to avoid any spoilers.<br /> The book suffers from the same thing that Attack of the Clones did.  It gets off to a slow start, but once it gets going hold onto your hats.<br /> It is really dark in the beginning and everyone was miserable and fighting.  We all knew it was going to be a dark book, but I think it was overdone.  With the next two supposed to get even darker, I can't help but wonder if Rowling is about to alienate her audience who don't want their children reading it.  Is there a PG-13 or R rating coming up for future movies?<br /> The "Final battle" is absolutely amazing.  I couldn't put it down for the last 150 pages or so.  Rowling out did herself with that.  Her writing, from the start of the book just keeps getting better and better.  There are a lot of plot twists that you never would have guessed.<br /> I just wish the first half of the book was as intriguing (and interesting) as the last.
