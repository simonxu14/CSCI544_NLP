This book is really wonderful! I've already had all seven books of Harry Potter series in Russian.  I wanted to have the full series in English. I was looking for the edition I would love the most and found this one. I was impressed and right now I am, because it's really pretty and finally illustrated! The sheets are of glossy paper. The main cover is hard and of really good quality. It's wrapped in a beautiful dust-cover with an illustration. And also there is a red tissue bookmark. I love it! And thank you for such New Year present! (such a fast delivery and very good quality of attitude towards this valuable for me stuff!) And, of course, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! Be happy all the time and everywhere!
