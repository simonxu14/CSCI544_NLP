The first two books in the Harry Potter series are both fantastic and I love them immensely, but this book is where the series really comes into its own and sets the stage for the epic four books that follow. The first two are pretty much self-contained mystery stories that stand on their own just fine, but at the end of The Prisoner of Azkaban, the scope has expanded in a thrilling and exciting way. The last one hundred and fifty pages of this book are among the most gripping I have ever read; I still don't know how Rowling pulled this off.<br /><br />If you have read the first and/or second book in the Harry Potter series and aren't sold on it yet, just read this one and I'll be shocked if this one does not convince you to continue the epic journey ahead of you.
