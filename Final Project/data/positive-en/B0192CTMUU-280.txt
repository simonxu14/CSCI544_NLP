Wow! Took me a little less than 2 days to read the whole bookas the only time I put it down was to fall asleep. I don't want togive anything away but I have to say Ms. Rowling continues to weave a great story about Harry, his friends, and their adventures. True to form the plot is wonderful and has all of the big and little surprises at the end that ties everything together which I believe is her trademark.<br />The only bummer about the book was finishing it and realizing I have to wait till next year for the 5th book.
