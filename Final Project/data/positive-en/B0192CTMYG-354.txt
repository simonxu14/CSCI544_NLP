I am a 47 year old professional and a very avid reader.  What makes the Harry Potter books so remarkable and enjoyable is that they capture the imagination of all ages.  I have read all three books and two of my  daughters are currently fighting over who gets to read &quot;The  Prisoner&quot; next.  We have two copies of each book so everyone can have  a chance at reading them.  And we thoroughly enjoy discussing our favorite  scenes, characters, names and places.  It is a rare experience when you can  be reading a book that you know will be a classic for decades to come.  Everyone who enjoys reading will LOVE these books
