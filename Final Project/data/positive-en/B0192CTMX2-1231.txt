The exploits of Harry Potter is now over and I will admit that I'm going to miss him and his friends. For Harry fan's this is a must read. If you're not a fan yet, try the first of the seven books and then come back for more. Although the finale looks like a lot of reading I found it amazingly easy to get into the story and very hard to put it down. Get started now.
