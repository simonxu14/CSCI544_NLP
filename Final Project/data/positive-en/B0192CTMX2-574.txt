Hype aside, I expected a lot of this book.  I did not expect my expectations to be exceeded so spectacularly.  I expected, and planned, to spend a full day reading the book cover to cover.  I did not expect to spend that day so completely riveted that taking a break was not even an option.  The fifth Harry Potter book is deeper, richer and more complex than its four predecessors, but it  also flows from and expands on the Potter history in an entirely natural way, growing as Harry and his friends grow in knowledge and experience, as Lord Voldemort's menace grows, and as author J. K. Rowling slowly unfolds the mysteries surrounding Harry and the peril in the wizarding world.  Plot and pacing aside, however, the greatest strength of the book is its honest and unflinching portrayal of the feelings and motives of its characters, including the less than noble, but very human, feelings and motivations that make the denizens of the wizarding world seem recognizable and real.  More than ever before, you step into the shoes of the main characters and feel what they feel.  This is especially true of Harry, who's every emotion reverberates in your heart, and gets thoroughly under your skin.  A major subtext in all of the Harry Potter series to date is the importance of not underestimating the ability of children to accept and deal with the truth, and their intolerance of deception even in the interests of their own protection.  J. K. Rowling does not fall into this trap.  She does not lie to kids--or to the rest of us.  Thank you for the pain and the joy, Ms. Rowling.  And now, if you will excuse me, I need to go read it again....
