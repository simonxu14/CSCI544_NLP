Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a marvelous edition to J.K. Rowling's library, and well worth the long, long wait and the number of pages.  Although the book is the darkest novel yet in the Harry Potter saga, it reads like one of the earlier editions, happy and light with plenty of humor thrown in compensate for the overall dark tone of the novel.  The plot is complex and involved, but never difficult as Rowling takes time and trouble to make certain everyone understands the mystery before moving to the next part.<br /><br />Many characters in this book become more well-rounded, and their actions are better justified.  Professor McGonagall becomes a much more likable character, and we get more insight into the reason behind Professor Snape's hatred of Harry.  We also see Harry's love life blossom somewhat as he ages, and he goes through typical teenage strife with his friends, Ron and Hermione.<br /><br />The ending is an exciting, heart-in-your-throat adventure that is sure to delight Harry Potter fans old and new.  My only advice for reading this book:  Don't make this your first Potter foray.  Read the other books first.  Rowling doesn't explain every detail from the first ones; she just assumes you've read them and doesn't bog you down with details you already remember (if you've read the first four).<br /><br />Basically, this is a very exciting book that well lives up to the Harry Potter saga and is sure to delight the many legions of fans who have waiting with bated breath for the newest edition.
