I am a middle aged closet Harry Potter fan.  I have now been totally spoiled by Jim Dale and his fabulous storytelling of Harry Potter. Of all the Harry Potter books, Goblet of Fire was my least favorite until I listened to this audio version.  Now, I love it just as much as the others.  I am afraid I have been spoiled by Jim Dale and any other reader will pale in comparison.  I highly recommend the entire collection and I am sure you will become a fan too!!!
