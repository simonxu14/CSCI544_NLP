Think of this as a suspense novel filled with wizards, magic, and all sorts of strange, intriguing creatures.<br />Rowling is incredible. Her writing is better than ever with this third installment. There is no &quot;factory&quot; atmosphere here. Her work just keeps getting better and better. The characters are maturing nicely and the story lines, although simple, are suspenseful and riveting! She has a knack for great endings full of surprises, confrontation, and second guessing.<br />This is her best yet. I was up until 3:30 am with this book and when it was all over, I was wanting Harry to stay at MY house for the summer!<br />My favorite chapter -- Hermione's secret.<br />Make time to read this one for sure!<br />Cris
