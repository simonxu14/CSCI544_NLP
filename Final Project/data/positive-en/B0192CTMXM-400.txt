I purchased this book to complete my Harry Potter series. I found a used copy of this book for 0.01 + $3.99 shipping. Although I was originally hesitant about the quality of this book for such a cheap price, I found that I neeedn't have worried. The book shipped to my house on time, and when I opened it up and inspected it, I was VERY impressed with the quality. The book looks almost brand new! This is an excellent addition to my Harry Potter series. I am so glad I bought it here! Great product, great seller, fast shipping. :)
