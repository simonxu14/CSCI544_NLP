This fifth installment of the Harry Potter series finds Harry an often angry, sullen teen facing his most excrutiatingly difficult year yet as his integrity and sanity are questioned and many close to him, discredited.  His friends remain steadfast and strength is found in unexpected places while some of Harry's views of his family are seen in a different light. Many questions submitted in the previous books are answered but more remain for the future books.  This book did not tie up the main storyline in as nice and tidy a package as did the previous four editions and Harry did not emerge as victorious from his trials, but the book was a very enjoyable and satisfying read I could hardly stand to put down - well worth the wait and the investment of time to read it.  I only hope the sixth book is already in the works as I can hardly wait!
