This CD was just as mesmerizing as the book except I could do other things while I listened! I didn't want to put stop listening! Jim Dale is great with the voices for the characters. I could picture the frail Olivander talking about the Hallows and feel Harry's pain as he manually dug the grave by the sea.  This is the end of the Happy Potter series but you will definately want to start from the beginning of the series to know what other trials Harry faced and how he got to this point.
