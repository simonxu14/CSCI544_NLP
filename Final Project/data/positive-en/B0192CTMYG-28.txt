I just finished reading this book for the first time ever and I am really very impressed and totally taken with the Potter universe!<br />I actually watched all eight movies before starting the books and I am glad I decided to do this.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about this series was how creative it is. The world that J.K. Rowling has created is so incredibly imaginative and fun. It really draws you in.<br /><br />Harry Potter, who is around eleven years old, is living with relatives who really don't like him or want him around. His parents died when he was a baby and he does not know anything about them other than that they supposedly died in a car crash. His life changes when he gets a letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He has been accepted into this school even though he has no idea that he possesses any kind of special powers. Other than a few &#34;coincidental&#34; odd things happening to his adopted family, he has not shown much of magical ability. Off he goes to Hogwarts, where he encounters an entire world which he did not know existed. At first he is afraid he will be behind all the other students, but when he begins classes and training he finds his place and begins to show many talents.<br /><br />This book is not as &#34;dark&#34; as some of the later books, which is nice. The characters are so lovable and the book is a very quick and easy read.<br /><br />Fantastic story! I will likely not be able to help measuring future fantasy/sci-fi books that I read up against this because it is just so incredible!
