This book was another masterpiece by J.K. Rowling. It was also very unique for a young adult fiction piece in that a death occurs. The book also allows the characters to grow up along with the reader base as they begin to experience innocent romance and jealousy.<br /><br />Rowling demonstrates why she is the master of young adult fiction and is responsible for a resurgence in the genre. Without the Harry Potter books, there would be no Hunger Games, Twilight, Divergence, etc.<br /><br />Rowling sets the standard.
