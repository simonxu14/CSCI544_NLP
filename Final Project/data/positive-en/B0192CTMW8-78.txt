I bought this book for my father for Christmas as his old &#34;Chamber Of Secrets&#34; was literally falling apart. I do wish that they had kept the back cover picture design but the book was in great condition. As for this series, there are no amount of words to describe how much I love the Harry Potter books. They will change your world! :)
