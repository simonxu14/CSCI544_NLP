Jim Kay does an excellent job capturing moments from the book. His illustrations of Harry are perfect. Dumbledore and Hagrid look amazing as well. Amazon has an amazing price for it! If you're a Harry Potter geek like me, you need this. I will say it is not as illustrated as I thought it was going to be but the illustrations are amazing! Definitely worth the buy!
