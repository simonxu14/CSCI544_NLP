My Early Birthday Present!!  My Favorite Book Series!  This is The First Fully Illustrated Edition Of Harry Potter.  Drawn by Artist Jim Kay.  This is a Big Heavy Coffee Table Sized Book.  I can't Express Enough how Beautiful the Few Illustrations that I have Glanced at are!  Truly an Artwork!  I can't wait to see the Rest of The Book After my Hands stop Sweating! ''<br />And it was packed with shine bubble packs on the back cover.  Would have preferred the front cover protected.  But all is well!  Only slightly tacked together on the page where the bookmark was and that was at the very top of page.  No big deal.  If this is a preclude to the other books; then my friends, we are in for a Truly special Treat!
