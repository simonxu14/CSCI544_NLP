What can I say?  I am also an adult fan.  My kids got me hooked! I loved all three previous books, and I love this one as well.  I think this one is  aimed at older kids, probably 9 and up.  My advice is for parents to read  it first to see if it fits their child's maturity level.  This book is  definitely different than the others in many ways.  It is a little darker  and is the beginning to a bigger story.  We can start to see the evilness  that everyone lived with when Voldemort and his followers were taking over.  I do not want to give any of the story away, so I am a little vague.  Ms.  Rowling really shows what a caring, honorable person Harry is.  Harry is a  very good example for our children, and one of my new heroes!  This book  stayed in my mind for a few day after I finished reading it. It was a great  book. I tried to read it slowly, to savor the story.  However, I could not  resist and finished it too fast!  As far as I am concerned, it could have  been 2734 pages and I would still be longing for more.  Ms. Rowling can  write a story like no other author can, at least in my opinion.  She is  truly an artist!  I cannot wait until the next!  BRAVO, JO ROWLING!
