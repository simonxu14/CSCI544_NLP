My ten year old listens to this audiobook every day. The cassette format is perfect for a young person carrying around a tape recorder that may be sturdier than an mp3 player or CD player. Our family has almost every book on tape and have been listening to the series over and over and over again for more than three years. The tapes have somewhat outlived three tape recorders that quit before they did. There's nothing like listening to a story with a top-notch storyteller (Jim Dale and J.K. Rowling).
