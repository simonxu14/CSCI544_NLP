This chapter in the Potter book might not be the best in the series, but overall it is a very fun read. One of the biggest knocks about this book is that Harry is so angry all the time, but that is how 15 year old teenagers act.<br />The major villian in this book (Unlike the other novels in this series) can mirror someone in your life at any given time. It is not the magic with this character is scary, but the need to control what you think and do.<br />This book also feels more of a setup to six and seven. Book five is much better the second time.
