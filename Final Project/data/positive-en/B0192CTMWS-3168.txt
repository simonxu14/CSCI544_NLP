let me start by saying i am very late with jumping on the harry potter band-wagon. i'm a college student and a few of my friends have been reading the series since the first book came out in 1998. whenever a new book or movie came out they would press upon me the idea that i HAVE to read these books. my friend even went as far as explaining the whole basic plotline to me right before this book came out in the summer of 2005. but i still didn't catch on. finally i caught the first harry potter movie on tv. i watched the second one with a friend the next week. then i went out and rented the 3rd and 4th movies. finally, i decided maybe i should read the books. i bought the first two and finished them in 4 days. well i couldn't stop there could i? so i bought the rest. And even though i had seen the movies, i couldn't put the first 4 books  down! now i am almost done with the 6th book (Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, which i also couldn't put down) and this particular book (Order of the Pheonix) is one of the best because it shows them all growing up and harry is in that difficult angsty-phase of adolenscence. very good book series no matter how old you are! ;)
