I must say the Harry Potter series of books is at the top of my favorites list. I have read everything from the WINGMAN series to all of Robert ludlums books, clancy to barker, even every single star wars book out there, and there are a LOT of those, but it just doesnt seem to matter than im in my 30's and these are childrens books, they are still as exciting to read as anything else i have ever read. I eagerly anticipate each new book as it comes out..., these just let you remember all of the hilarious antics you did in school at Harry's age. While the series is getting deeper and darker, the humor seems to have picked up in this last book. Can we all imagine how many pranks we could have played if we could use magic in school? HeHeHe Its interesting that a semi major character dies in The order of the Pheonix, i think it was a good thing since there is a huge fan base of adults readin the series now, so it adds to the real world feel you get from the world. Overall id have to say this is by far the best book of the series to date. Regardless as to the books size and page count, it is a serious page turner, whether its action or humor you are looking forward too, there is pretty much something for everyone in this series. Outstanding job J.K.R..
