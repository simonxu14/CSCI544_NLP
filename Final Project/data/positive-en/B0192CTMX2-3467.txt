What hold comes over me when I pick up J.K. Rowling's books, even as a 23 year-old, is unexplainable, but "Deathly Hallows" is no exception. I savoured the experience of reading it, especially because it is chock-full of both action and the details that us fantasy-lovers need to have.  J.K. emphasizes the point that nothing is black-and-white, as shown by her handling of Severus' and Albus' role in the book. Relationships are seen in a new light, secrets revealed, suspense built up, everything that keeps you turning page and page and fills you with grief, joy, and wonder - what you expect from Harry Potter. I really can't believe the journey has come to an end!
