I think this was the best, most action packed Harry Potter book out of the series. It's too bad that we had to wait till the last book to see it. I'm not going to discuss the plot because most who will read this will not have read the book yet. But when Rowling said she tied up everything, with the exception of a few missing details that I would have liked to have, she was not kidding. The last chapter really brought everything to close, answered most questions and the epilogue finished the rest in a neat little package. I almost did not want to finish it because I knew that once I did, there would be no more books to look forward to. A spin off series with the next generation of Hogwarts students would be interesting, but it is probably best to leave well enough alone. But I would recommend this book to anyone, Harry Fans and non. However, if you haven't read at least Book 6 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, then I don't suggest you read this just yet. Without reading at least Book 6 you may get confused. Harry Potter is one of those series where you miss alot if you read it out of order.
