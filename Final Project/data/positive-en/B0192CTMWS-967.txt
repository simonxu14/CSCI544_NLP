The first two Harry Potter books were so very good that I didn't imagine they could be topped.  I would have been happy with a book of the same calibre, but the Prisoner of Azkaban is even better!  I don't know how J.K.  Rowlings does it, her imagination is unbelievable.  I read AmazonUK.com's  interview with her and one of the questions was, &quot;Will you ever write  books for adults?&quot;  Well, who ever came up with that question has  never read her books.  Harry Potter is as much for adults as for children.  The wonderful thing about them is that they appeal to and can be enjoyed by  all ages.  What a treat for parents and children to be able to share a book  together!
