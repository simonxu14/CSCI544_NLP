Wow, finishing this book only an hour ago, I have to say that the days of Lockhart and other wild antics seem to be long gone. Everything, including Dobby and Hagrid has turned much darker and more foreboding. I love the Harry Potter series, but I wish this book had more lighter moments to balance out the ominous tone in this book.
