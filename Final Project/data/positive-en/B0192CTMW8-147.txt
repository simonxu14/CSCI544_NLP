Amazon has the cheapest prices I've found for the unabridged audiobook CDs narrated by Jim Dale.  That being said, they are still rather expensive.  Buy with caution because this is a well-written series, narrated by a more-than-able voice artist, and it will almost certainly lead to an addiction.  Affording one of these audiobooks isn't too much of a financial stretch, but starting a collection, however, can leave you searching for loose change.  Overall, I would recommend this product to any fan of the HP series.  They are great for long trips and for people who lack the time to sit down and read the books.  5-star product / 3 star-price.
