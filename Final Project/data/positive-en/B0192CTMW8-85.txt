I am reading all of the Harry Potter books from start to finish and have enjoyed them so far. Despite having seen all except the last movie (I am planning on reading the last book then seeing it) the reading the books offers a fun and diverse experience. You can pick up on imagery and details that are left out in the movies. I wish I had read these without seeing the movies first but either way you cannot go wrong with Harry Potter. Some of the most charming, heart-warming, and magical tales written in the last century.
