Considering all of the hype associated with this book, I was a little apprehensive when first reading it. I'm pleased to say that this book was nothing short of a masterpiece. I read the whole thing in one sitting! I couldn't put it down.<br /><br /> I applaud Ms. Rowling for her magnificent writing in tying up all the loose ends of the Harry Potter story and coming up with a beautiful ending.
