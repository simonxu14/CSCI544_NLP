While this is meant to be a childrens book. It like all the others in the Harry Potter series are for all ages. I haven't be a kid in many years but this book and all the rest bring out the child in me. I got my book on  Saturday afternoon and couldn't put it down. I would have to say that it is  one of my favorites in the series. It has all the wonderful suspense the  makes books fun to read.
