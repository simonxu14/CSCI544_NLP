This illustrated version of the book is great, all the pictures are well done. Although the sorting hat is my least favorite, not that it is bad, just not how I envisioned it..  Just wish we could have seen an illustration of Firenze, and more of Snape.  I can't wait for the illustrated version of COS to come out.
