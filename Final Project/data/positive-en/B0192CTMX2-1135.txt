I was very concerned after a 3 year wait that this book was going to be a disappointment, but it definitely was not! It was very interesting to see Harry becoming a teenager, although I was surprised he was so angry all the time. I was also sad to see one of my fave character's die, although I suspected this individual whenever I first heard that someone was going to die. Now I want to know when the 6th book will be out!!! This one was great!
