There are a lot of reviews here, so I'll keep mine brief. There are a few things I'd like to mention that stayed with me after I finished the book:<br /><br />In this book Harry reaches his 17th birthday, which basically means the protectve charm that has kept him safe for 16 years will break. He is now fair game for Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Therein lies the premise for the entire book. This is all about how he, Ron and Hermoine plan to track down the Dark Lord and defeat him. Other characters (some we have met before and a few new ones) are drawn into the plan, and yes, a few of them die. As shocking as the deaths were, I was moved by the characters strength and allegiance to Harry. Contrary to what some have to say here, overall I found Rowling's writing to be superb. No one can weave a story the way she does. There is so much emotion in this book. You are put right in the midst of the action, and it really doesn't let up until the very end. Yes, there were some editing blunders, but so what? I am not a nitpicker, I just want a good story and I feel I got my money's worth here. There are some explosive revelations in this book as well...wait until you here about Dumbledore's past, and Snape's true nature, and the truth behind Harry's past. I loved it -- if you're a Potter fan, or if you want to know what the hoopla is all about, check it out (although I would not recommending starting with this book - you can start with Book 3 and catch up).<br /><br />Enjoy...
