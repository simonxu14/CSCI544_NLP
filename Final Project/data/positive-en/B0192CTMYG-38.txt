I just read all the Harry Potter books again (in my 40s now) and for some reason I was missing this first one in the series.  It is very simple and sweet and short in comparison to the rest of the books.  They progressively get better in my opinion.  I prefer the British versions for their authenticity, but altogether it is a very enjoyable series. My very religious brother did not want his kids to read them until I informed him that it is the same story at &#34;Star Wars&#34; (which he loves), just with 'magic' instead of the 'Force'.
