You won't be disappointed by any of the Potter books. Just get all of them. It is hard to put down once you open the first page. I have a friend who asked me whether he still needs to read the books since he has seen the movies (5 movies so far), but the joy of Harry Potter lies not just in the motion pictures. You will experience much more inside the books: the language Joanna Rowling uses, richer characters and more twists, a world full of imagination. I felt strong resonance while I was reading Harry Potter; the enchanted world is really a reflection of our current society.
