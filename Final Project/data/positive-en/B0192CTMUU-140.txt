This product was excactly what I wanted. I owned all of the books in the Harry Potter series except for The Goblet of Fire and now my collection is complete. If you want this book note that it is not a hard cover but when it is delivered it is in perfect condition there are no rips and neither the cover nor the pages were bent. I ordered standard shipping and it came with in 3 days which I was very happy about because I was so anxious to actually read the fourth Harry Potter at last. If you are looking to complete your Harry Potter book collection or you just want a good read (I suggest the entire series though) then this is the perfect book for you. BUY IT!!!!!
