I would highly recommend this book. I don't know if you ever get migraine headaches but I've had one all weekend from summer school yet I still couldn't put this book down. The mystery is so enthralling, the adventure  so exciting, and the fantasy so spelllbinding that it makes a very easy yet  enjoyable read.  The reader cannot help but relate to Harry's problems even  though they're a world apart. That's probably what is so unique about the  book: Although it very obviously happens in an alternate reality where  magic happens, the people could easily be real.  Coming of age,  prejudice,  power hungriness, and hate are all the same issues in Harry's world as in  ours.  Anyways, the only thing I was disappointed about was that the ending  was less than emotionally fulfilling.  Yet being the turning point in the  series, I cannot think of anything else that could have made sense.  Hence  5 stars, hence read the book.
