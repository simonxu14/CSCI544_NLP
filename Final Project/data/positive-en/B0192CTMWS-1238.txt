After you've read the first 6, it'd be pretty dumb not to get the last installment of one of the best series ever. I'm sad to see it end.<br /><br />I thought the book was very good. I got lost a few times but that might be because I was reading it at 2 or 3 in the morning. I cannot wait for the movie to come out.<br /><br />Very good. I couldn't put it down. Highly recommended.
