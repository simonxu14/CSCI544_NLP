You are not sacrificing anything by listening to the audiobook rather than reading the book.  The tone and delivery of Deathly Hallows is superb.  You can tell which character is which before the name is even said.  For me and other people who are obsessive HP readers, you'll appreciate not having the strain on your eyes after a car trip of HP.  It is a very gripping story, and after this most recent movie release, I'm looking forward to sitting down and listening to the story one more time before the next movie comes out.
