I enjoyed it. However you should keep in mind that it is a screenplay, not a full HP novel. Plus, it is not about Harry Potter at all. Pros: 1) nice edition with fantastic graphic drawings; 2) easy to read; 3) the story itself is much more interesting than the most recent play about HP; 4) it has a wonder of introducing a magical world to a non-magic person (remember the very 1st HP book?) - the idea itself is winning. Cons: 1) too short - I finished it in a few hours; 2) it seems to be a stamped story - as any other comics and really reminded me &#34;Ghostbusters&#34; movie 1984, it could have been about any other world, not only HP; 3) it lacks the description of beasts - sometimes none at all, and you need at least something to put your imagination into - one has to see the movie to know what they are<br />meant to be look like; 4) there is really not enough of a story to make a full novel. It's too movie genre-like - if you know what I mean - like first-met-30-minutes-ago-heroes passionately kissing in front of a ruining world - happy &#34;end&#34;.<br />Overall as I said I enjoyed it much better compared to a disaster named &#34;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&#34;. I'd love to see the movie.
