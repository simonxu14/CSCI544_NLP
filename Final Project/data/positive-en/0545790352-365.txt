Must own for fans of the book series!  This book is beautiful from cover to cover! I can't stop looking at the pictures! The pages that do not have illustrations have subtle background color. No page is left white! The pictures really bring the story to life, and are fantastically done!  My 7 year old who wasn't really interested in reading the series is now reading this copy! I can't say enough good things.  Even if you own a previous copy of the book, this one is a must own!!!
