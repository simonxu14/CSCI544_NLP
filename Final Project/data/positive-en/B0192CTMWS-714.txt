After three years of anticipation, I'm not sure that any book could have pleased anyone. OoP moves the central plot forward, and develops some of the characters much more, while still giving a few tantalizing glimpses of the wizarding world.<br />I had one complaint - Harry spends a great deal of the book whining and acting generally younger than he did in the previous books. Far from a young man, made an adult before his time, he doesn't even act like a conventional 15-16 year old. For those that have been following the series, this probably won't make a difference, but the series' success is built on the likability of Harry, the boy who didn't choose his fate.<br />The book's ending is darker than the previous books - a trend that has continued, which probably won't disappoint those that have been following the series from the beginning. However, parents of young children may not want to buy them the entire series just yet - remember, those that were young when they read book one are now young adults, and have grown up with the books. Those that seem like the right age for book one now may not be able to understand some of the events of the book.
