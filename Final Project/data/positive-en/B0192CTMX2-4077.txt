Valley Gay Press Book Reviewer: Liz Bradbury<br />I was all set to read this book for a review in time for the Aug-Sept VGP. I especially ordered it to be delivered right to our house on the day it was released. And it came right on time. The trouble was that we had two ten-year-old boys visiting us for four days. I read them the first two chapters,  and I was looking forward to reading the rest of the book. Here's the glitch though. One of the kids, the one who had already read the first six Potter books snagged my copy and wouldn't give it back! He read 200 pages that day and I realized I wasn't going to get to read it unless we bought him his own copy. So we did and he'd nearly reached the end of the 759 page book 2 1/2 days later when he left for home. I finished my copy the next day. In a nut shell, it was a great read.
