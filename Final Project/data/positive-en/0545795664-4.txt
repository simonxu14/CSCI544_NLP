My son loves this book.  It contains all sorts of bits and pieces about the Pokemon characters.  I don't think it really helps in anyway with actually playing the game, but it's a nice addition to any Pokemon fan's collection.<br /><br />I should read this book myself and increase my knowledge of Pokemon, that way when my son is talking to me about it I won't think he's speaking Greek (which wouldn't be a problem if I'm Greek, but I'm not).  Hmmm, do you think citizens of Greece have a similar saying, like &#34;That guy was talking to me about rocket science but it all sounded like &#60;insert some other language than Greek here&#62; to me&#34;?  If you're Greek, please leave a comment, I'd really like to know.<br /><br />And if you are Greek, you'll be happy to know that your child will love this book if you get it for them.<br /><br />I've read other reviews saying the book will start to fall apart quickly, but my son hasn't abused his enough yet.  I'm sure after a few trips in his backpack time will tell.  I'll post a follow-up review and let you know.<br /><br />***UPDATE 2/26/2016***<br />I'm happy to report that after hauling this thing around in his backpack since Christmas, this book is still holding together very well.  No pages have fallen out, the spine isn't broken, the cover is still intact, etc...  This book still gets frequent use, because my son tries to convince me daily that reading this should count toward his 30 minutes-of-reading-at-home requirement.
