Book #145 Read in 2015<br />Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by JK Rowling (illustrated)<br /><br />This is a beautiful book.  This is the first of the Harry Potter series and the illustrations are lush and beautiful.  Harry discovers he is a wizard and heads to the Hogwart's school of magic to learn how to use his magical powers.  This is my all-time favorite series, with wonderful characters, interesting plots and magical reading.  This series is a must-read for both children and adults.<br /><br />http://melissasbookpicks.blogspot.com
