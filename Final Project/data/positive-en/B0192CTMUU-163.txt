I liked the product, it was cheap which was good for my wallet but the bad thing about it, was that the cover was kind of bleached but if you remove it the paper cover the actaul cover of the book is in very good conditions but the other problem I had was that the paper cover was (just one tiny part) was glued in the main cover, but from there, I think the product is okay.
