Harry Potter fans will not be disappointed at the latest installment in the Rowling series. I read the 870 page book in less than two days time, as it is such a pageturner one will find it hard to put down. (There is a dent in my couch to prove it). The author's vivid imagery brings you into the story, and you will laugh, cry, and expunge shocked gasps as the twists and turns are revealed. I will not spoil the plot by going into detail, but prepare to gain knowledge that finally details Harry's connection to Voldemort. Brava to the esteemed author, for another brilliant piece. Now, the hardest part is waiting for the next two... Enjoy!!
