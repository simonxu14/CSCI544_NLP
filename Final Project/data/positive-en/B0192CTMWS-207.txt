The last Harry Potter is in many ways the best of the lot, showing what a great craftsman Rowling is. She has drawn together all the threads of the various subplots of the prior six books in a graceful, never forced way. The epilogue feels a bit much, unfortunately, and it is not of the same caliber as the prior pages, but this is a small quibble. Overall, I'd recommend it highly. I had to ration my reading to 100 pages a day, otherwise, I would have read it straight through in one sitting - rather like eating a whole box of Godiva chocialtes in one sitting. Savor this book, and enjoy wondering what Rowling will write next!
