As a long-term fan of Harry Potter, I was EXTREMELY excited to hear about an illustrated edition being published.  I kept checking my order, waiting for notification of shipment, and then waiting eagerly for the postman to drop it on my front porch.  It arrived today, a mere day after being shipped out!  I was ecstatic, and I cannot stop staring at it!  Just admiring it!<br /><br />This book is absolutely beautiful!  A childhood favorite that I will one day read to children of my own.  The illustrations are colorful, and add even more life to this already fantastic story.  Mr. Kay did an AMAZING job.  I hope that this book is successful (though I'm sure it will be!), and that Rowling and Kay decide &#34;Hey! Maybe it's a good idea to do Chamber of Secrets Illustrated!&#34;  And then Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire, all the way up to Deathly Hallows!  I would buy all of those in a heartbeat.<br /><br />A truly fabulous addition to a truly fabulous series.  Highly recommended to any Harry Potter fan!
