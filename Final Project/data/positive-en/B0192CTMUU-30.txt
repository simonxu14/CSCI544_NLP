Love all the Harry Potter series of books. Read them to my youngest daughter when she was 6. She's 21 now & still loves the books & is also an avid reader.<br />I'm now reading them to my twin grandsons, age 9. They love them. This particular book starts to change the story line a bit. It shows a little of the darker side to come. First character death happens in this book.<br />Thanks to J. K. Rowling for creating a beautiful world that has captured the imagination of millions of young minds & got them interested in reading again.
