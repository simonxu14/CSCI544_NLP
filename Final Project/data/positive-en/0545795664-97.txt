Very pleased with this book. I bought it for my 4 year old son as he loves Pokemon and always wants to know their names. The pictures are great and he loves to look through the book and search for new Pokemon. He enjoys to hear all the information that is listed for each Pokemon. Pokemon are listed in alphabetical order and the description includes the name, how to say it, height and weight, possible moves, description, evolution, mega evolution, type, and region. His favorite part is looking at the evolution part of the Pokemon and seeing how they evolve. 432 pages. Great beginning book for Pokemon hunters!
