I am sure many people have either read these books or seen these movies. Which to do first? Well, the books are great. They allow you, in great detail, to imagine everything that is going on. They take you away from life and put you in a fantasy world, albeit, for a little while. Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire is a great book, just like all the others. My suggestion is read the book before watching the movie. The movie really fills it all in, but the book leaves it to the imagination. Rowling is a great author and these books should not be missed. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, just like all the others, will transcend time and kids and adults 50 years from now will still be reading these.
