I bought this audio book for my mom (though I am addicted to the series so I will probably be borrowing it now and again) and she absolutely loves it.  She can listen to them in the car or at home when she is doing chores or just relaxing (not that my mother really knows how to sit still).  But it is an excellent price (it's hard to find them any cheaper and they cost a lot more at other sellers) and I get another book every year for her for Christmas/B-Day/Mother's Day.  If you are looking for a good gift for a book lover then this series is a really good choice.
