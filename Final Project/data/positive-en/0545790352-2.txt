The book itself and illustrations are absolutely, incredibly extraordinary.  In that way, this is 100% a 10-STAR book and is absolutely to die for for Harry Potter fans. I was ravenous to get my hands on my copy as soon as it was delivered this morning, but was quickly disappointed.<br /><br />First, Amazon's packaging was utterly and despicably inadequate. (See Photo)  My book was shipped in a box, with *no packing material* of any kind.  At first glance, it seemed OK.  But when I took a close look at my dust jacket, I was extremely upset to find that the gold foil lettering for &#34;Harry Potter&#34; had been rubbed away and destroyed completely in some places leaving ugly, black matte in its place-- pock marking the otherwise handsome gold lettering.  Also, the matte-finish of the dust jacket had been rubbed so badly due to the bad packaging that it left scars and shiny markings where the matte finish was worn off.  For an obvious gift/collectors item, this is absolutely unacceptable.  I called Amazon and they didn't seem to &#34;get&#34; what my fuss was all about and just offered to ship a replacement which, undoubtedly, will be shipped in exactly the same way.<br /><br />Second, after I got over my initial outrage over the shipping/packaging.  I sat down to enjoy the actual book itself, which as I said is absolutely extraordinary! I was extremely cautious handling the book and binding, being unsure how tolerant the binding is of weight.  I carefully opened both the right and left sides of the binding and supported the weight of the opened cover using a small pillow.  By the time I reached the back 3/4th of the book (on Professor McGonagall's full page illustration) the binding separated from the spine the very first time I turned the page.  In other words, the binding fell apart during my very first pass through the book.  (See Photo).  Another thing that really drove me crazy was the way that the stitched in book mark was carelessly folded into the book.  It left dents all over my pages (See Photo), which of course had to be on a full page illustration of Hagrid!<br /><br />Needless to say I'm in awe how Bloomsbury has managed to put together such an incredible project, with JK Rowling's remarkable literature and Jim Kay's otherworldly illustrations-- and allowed it to be put together in a low quality binding!  I noticed that all of the previous Harry Potter books were printed and bound in USA (some in Mexico) but this book was printed and bound in China.  I would like to hope that they would quality check a thing like this, but perhaps not.  Either way, I am extremely disappointed in the quality/binding of my book.  I would be interested to know if others are seeing the same thing. And please, Amazon, pack these books in bubble wrap and packing material! Not all alone in a box...<br /><br />Update (October 9th): I have finally received my new book and it was in much, much better condition.  The cover and spine were tight, intact and falling apart from the binding like my original copy.  Addtl photos to follow...
