I read some of the reviews about this book and still feel it was a good book.  I wouldn't have noticed the use of ellipsis had it not been for other reviews.  Also, I actually enjoyed the pages devoted to talking about house cleaning and other trivialties.  The point of this kind of literature is to suck you into the world, not just create a thesis.  Being a little sidetracked was nice.  It is, after all, written for adolescents and not for adults.  I realize some will find it tedious but I personally didn't.
