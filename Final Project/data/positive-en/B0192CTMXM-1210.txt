This was a fantastic ending to an amazing story. Yet, Jim Dale still manages to elevate this story with uncanny knack for voices and incredible skill at telling a story. I have listened to other Audiobooks and there is no comparison to Jim Dale. Over the course of the 7 books, his voices for the kids in the books have aged along with the kids. Cannot praise his work enough.
