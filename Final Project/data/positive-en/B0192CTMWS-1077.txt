I really, really enjoyed the book. I feel it moved at a good pace, had good plot development, and she definitely went on killing spree. Definitely a great coming of age book though. I feel Rowling really did a great job finishing the series, and tying up a lot of the loose ends. I feel she answered a lot questions I had about the series too. Also I think it really shows how much she had planned from the beginning as well. It was just very entertaining, and I definitely didn't really want to put the book down.
