Finally the seventh book!!  It's a great book. I'll try to be careful not to give out any details of the story. There is quite a bit of rambling in the middle of the book, it appears that JKR might have had some writer's block or didn't know how to make the story progress.  A lot of back and forth and waiting around for the characters.  JKR could have used these pages to explain more and answer Potter fan questions about the septology.  A lot of questions and mysteries have been answered but there is a bunch more information that has been left out, I guess this way she can keep it alive and write an after Harry Potter book and make even more money.
