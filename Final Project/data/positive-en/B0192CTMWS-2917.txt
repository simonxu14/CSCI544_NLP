JRR Tolkien, CS Lewis, Roald Dahl and now JK Rowling.  A series of books the likes of this - passionate, exciting, popular, culturally changing, critically acclaimed - comes along once in one or two generations. I am proud to be a part of this generation's 'read' of these books (I am 42! LOL)...There is no comparison. Words cannot describe this book(s)...So many of you have said so many things wonderfully and on target in your reviews so there is littlemroe I can add. DH is by far the best and brings the series to a circular close of sorts, but leaves you knowing the strength of life and (cliche) power of love as it 'begins' again (you'll see when you read the epilogue...)<br /><br />These books will be on the shelves of children, adults and families for generations to come. Very few authors have this ability to span generations and Joanne Rowling has accomplished that. I look forward to her future books and will always have a special fondness and affection for Harry Potter as will millions of parents, their children as will THEIR children.
