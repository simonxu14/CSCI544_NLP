Awesome book. Amazing art.  Great combo.  I do have this book as orginalky written but took a chance in ordering the illustrated to get my o year old interested in reading the series and it worked..the original book can be intimidating to some in size but this book is juist so much fun with the art and magic it adds to it..we have watched the movies multiple times but my daughter still got this book and read it all and took it all in.. I got her the second book chamber of secrets for christmas she doesnt know but she has been asking for it constantly wants to hold the big illustrated books and read them all. I did internet search and it eill be hard to wait a year for the third illustrated book to be released.  This is a great book to have in any home library and any Potter fan would love to have this.
