This is my favorite of the HARRY POTTER books and I think that it is one of the best fantasies that I ever read.  Why?<br /><br />(1) More complexity to the characters (although this is partly because many of them were flat in previous books).  On the evildoers' side, Dudley has the nerve to side with Harry against his parents for once.  Draco saves Hermione's life by pretending not to recognize her when the DeathEaters are present.  On the good guys' side, we learn of a tragic mistake in Dumbledore's side.  Harry has to cast some taboo curses, and all three heroes do some unpleasant things like insulting Lupin and making an insincere promise to Griphook.  Rowling doesn't justify them; she just reminds us that they have been demoralized by years of fighting Voldamort.<br /><br />(2) The way the three heros are pushed to the extreme.  In all the previous books they at least had the partial protection of being at Hogwarts with some support from well-meaning adults.  For most of this book they are strictly on their own, living by their wits.  At the central point Harry is physically and symbolically naked, at the low point of his career, and from this point he finally rises to the point where he can defeat Voldamort.<br /><br />(3) Oddly enough, the sheer messiness.  It takes the heroes months of futility and going in circles to get things done.  I don't think this is just to pad out the book, or to stretch it out to fit the school year.  It is how problems get handled in the real world, unlike a TV episode where everything gets solved in an hour.<br /><br />Two or three irritating omissions.  We never learn exactly how Voldamort takes over.  Are wizard politics so primitive that his minions can take over simply by occupying the Ministry building?  If not, what did they do?  Another problem is that Rowling, conscious of the fact that little kids are reading her book, has to gloss over sexual complications.  Put three hormonal and bored teenagers in close quarters for months and they're bound to feel some temptation, yet she only addresses the issue once, and treats it as a temptation from Voldamort.  And Umbridge disappears after a couple of early chapters as a villainess.  She is last seen falling and banging her head; did she get too brain-damaged to function for the rest of the book?  It would have been interesting to know.  But the omissions don't ruin a great story.
