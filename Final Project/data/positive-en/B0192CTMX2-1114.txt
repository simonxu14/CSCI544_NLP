As a mature fan of the Harry Potter series, I'd been looking forward to the final book of the series.  It was well work waiting for.  Ms. Rowlings's imagination and use of the language make the Potter books wonderful reads for any age.  The last one certainly is on of the best of the series and I do hope this doesn't mean she'll stop writing.  I'll be looking forward to her first non-Harry book.
