I have read and enjoyed the first 6 books in the Harry Potter Series and couldn't wait to read the 7th!  I read a wide variety of books and enjoy Harry's adventures for fun and escape.  Rowling makes a believer out of me every time I open one of the Potter books!  My 10 year old grandson has started Book 1 and we sometimes sit and read together.
