This book is amazing! I got it for my 6 year old son who is super into pokemon right now for christmas. He could care less about all the toys and other presents he got. This was his favorite gift. He spends the majority of the day looking through it and learning all about pokemon and is constantly showing me all the polemon and asing me to help him read it. It lists over 700 pokemon and everything about them including what type of pokemon it is, how to pronounce the name, what region(s) its from, their height and weight, possible moves/attacks, what they evolve into with pictures, etc.<br /><br />The only con I've found is there is no index where it tells you what page each one is on to find it better. There are 432 pages of pokemon! So it can be a little hard to find a certain pokemon that you're looking for, BUT it is in alphabetical order so it's not too hard.  But it would better if it listed the page numbers and maybe listed them by type of pokemon or something like that in the back.
