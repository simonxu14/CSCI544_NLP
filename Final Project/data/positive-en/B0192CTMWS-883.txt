I received my book via Amazon on the date of release...my daughter snatched it up and ready it in 1 1/2 days. Busy with work and getting ready for vacation I limited myself to 1 chapter a day. This worked out very well for me as I am the type that loves the anticipation and excitement more than the actual event (such as Christmas morning!). I closed the passenger door of our minivan and began to read until finished. Wow! Fantastic ending - the best book yet. Despite the leaks of the ending on-line and via friends....I held onto my faith that the good always wins, and evil always loses. Thank you JK Rowling for re-affirming this in your book so wrought with controversy in the christian arena. Magic, love, growing pains and all - a fantastic series to all those who believe in the fantasy of fiction and the imagination!
