I love to listen to audiobooks at work and am I big HP fan, so this was a must buy for me! Jim Dale is excellent as a narrator and J.K. Rowling's works are fantastic! Although I have read the Sorcerer's Stone countless times, I still find things that I have missed when it's read in this medium.<br /><br />If you're a Harry Potter and/or and audio book fan, this is a must buy! I have listened to it many times, and will be purchasing other books in the series soon.
