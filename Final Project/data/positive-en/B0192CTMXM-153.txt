I admit it. I used to hate Harry Potter. Then my best friend made me start reading it, and by the time I got to this book, she didn't have to keep making me. This series has me so entranced that even if I wanted to I couldn't stop. (Tip to those who don't like Harry Potter)<br />Don't start reading this if you want to ever stop!
