This book is one of the greatest book I have ever read. It is known for the children mostly but even grown ups love this book. As I am now 25 I am still in love with this book. Yes, the competitors like twilight are excellent books to but Harry Potter is still number one series for children, young adults, and most grown ups. I would recommend this book to anyone who is into love, fantasy, action, and mystery. The whole series just flows with excitement and its one book that is hard to it down. I catch my self reading at night before bed and end up reading way to long because u get so involved its hard to tell how long you have read. My children will be asked to read this book when there old enough I'm sure  they will love it just as much as I have.
