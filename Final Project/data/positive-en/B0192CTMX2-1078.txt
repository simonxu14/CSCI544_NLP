This was not my favorite book in the Harry Potter Series ("Chambers" was), but that's all relative, because the whole series has been fantastic. When was the last time that literally millions of people in the U.S. and the U.K. all bonded together around a book series? (Hint: Never.) I'm very sad to see the series end. However, I have to believe that J.K. Rowling is already hatching ideas for a fresh new story, perhaps with entirely different characters. I'll be among the first to buy whatever new books she writes.
