Really loved this series, this book was no disappointment.  The author didn't write it the way I wanted (which I doubt I could even articulate) and yet she managed brilliantly to finish the series and leave me completely satisifed.  I just knew I would read it and be left wanting more.  I don't think I have ever finished a series feeling like that.  That being said, if she ever writes anything even remotely connected to this world of Harry Potter, I would be first in line.<br /><br />Book 7 review aside, I hated the epilogue.  While it did satisfy curiosity, it was very unsatisfying in every other way.  It was too brief and very cliche.  The quality of the writing seems inferior in every way to the books.  It seems like this could have been jotted down on a napkin and added at the last minute...and they lived happily ever after.
