I was a little concerned about the Harry Potter series coming to an end...wondering, is the last book going to leave me wanting more, or worse, will it sully the entire series for me? I was very pleasantly surprised that this book was my favorite of all.  I reread book 6 and then started right in on book 7, finishing both in less than three days. It's addictive, and I just couldn't put it down.  Thank you Ms Rowling for giving us the story of Harry Potter!
