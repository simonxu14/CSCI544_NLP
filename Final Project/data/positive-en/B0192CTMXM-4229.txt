I enjoyed this final installment except I felt it lacked genuine emotion amongst the characters.  J.K. didn't spend much time allowing them (and the reader)  to "feel" after important and extremely emotional events occurred.  I felt she rushed through those particular happenings and concentrated more on the battles.  I didn't have any time to mourn or celebrate, which would have made the book so much more satisfying!!<br /><br />At times I got confused because so many names were being thrown around from the last book.  Reading Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is highly recommended  right before reading this final book so you're able to keep track of some of the newer characters.  If you haven't read any of the past books, you will be totally lost,  although I think most readers understand that.<br /><br />Without giving too much away, I wished the final chapter had been more current and I felt like I'd missed so much of  what I'd been hoping to experience between the characters.
