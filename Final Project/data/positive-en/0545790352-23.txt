This book is so beautiful! I read it as soon as it was delivered and I felt like it was the first time.  The illustrations greatly capture what reader's imaginations have in their mind. I hope they redo all the rest of the books in illustrated versions. This book is a must have for any Harry Potter fan, or even those reading this book for the first time.
