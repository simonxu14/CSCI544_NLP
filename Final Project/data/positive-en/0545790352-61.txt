I am just blown away by how amazing this book is! This is exactly what I've been waiting for! It's the perfect timing as I have young children just learning to read. Having illustrations makes it so much more enthralling to them. I cannot wait to buy every single one of the illustrated harry Potter collection. I would recommend it to anybody and you would not be disappointed I promise!
