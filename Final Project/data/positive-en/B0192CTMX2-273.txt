  I highly recommend reading Harry Potter: The Deathly Hollows by J.K Rowling out of 5 stars because the book is influential.<br />For example, after all these when Harry's parents and others died, he kept moving on with his life, but still remembering his<br />loved ones inside his heart. This is very sympathetic since Harry has lost many of family and friends.Also in the book he was<br /> willing to die just for all of his friends could still live.This is very courageous that he would die just for his comrades instead of<br /> still living and try to find another way to defeat the enemy. In the book, wizards can do extraordinary things with their wands <br />and power like teleporting into anywhere, spells, and be physically able to fly on special creatures and broomsticks. This is very cool and wanting to do it since we cannot. In conclusion I have told you what you want to hear, bu the book will tell you more if you just open the book and discover the adventurous journeys in it and you will enjoy it.
