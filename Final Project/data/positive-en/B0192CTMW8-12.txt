Bought this as my 13 year is finally getting into the Harry Potter series after finishing the first novel. From the second this book arrived in the mail he was glued and hasn't been able to put it down. Glad he's busy reading a great book instead of playing video games. Ended up buying him the entire series. He's so excited for the rest of the books to arrive now. I think I may read them all myself.
