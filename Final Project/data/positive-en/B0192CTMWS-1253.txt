This was a great book.  I couldn't put it down.  Having followed the series from the beginning, I had high hopes, as well as reservations, about where it would go.  The middle sagged slightly, but when relating to the issues the characters are facing it was understandable.  The end wrapped up nicely, making it easier to say goodbye to our beloved Harry.
