I got the product in a timely manner and it was brilliantly packaged (you know the packaging is good when it takes you longer than 5 minutes to open it).  Just as it was promised to be, the book was in excellent condition.  The book was a Christmas present and the recipient was thrilled when they recieved the book.  I will definately order from them again.
