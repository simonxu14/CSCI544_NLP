I am so thrilled, and beyond, to have this version of the book. It's Harry Potter, so obviously you know the book is good, but the pictures are stunning! The artwork is on every page, anything from full page landscapes to tiny potion splatters, there are beautiful touches with every turn. I love this new edition and hope to give it as a gift to my fellow HP lovers!
