My wife is a Harry Potter nut. She already has the hardcover and paperback versions of all the books, but when I saw this was being released, I knew I had to get it for her for Christmas. Like I said, I'm not into Harry Potter, but this book is beautiful! It is a nice, heavy, well put together book. The illustrations are so crisp and eye catching. If you are a Harry Potter fan, or love someone who is, you must buy this book!
