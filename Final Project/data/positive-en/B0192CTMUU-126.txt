I am 12 years old and addicted to the Harry Potterbooks. ... With tons of new characters, and even a close up Quidditchfinal this book is very addictive. I found the basic Good-guy Bad-guy rivalry,(as in all books)But with a newer twist. How can Harry survive the latest challenges? Find out and read Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire!
