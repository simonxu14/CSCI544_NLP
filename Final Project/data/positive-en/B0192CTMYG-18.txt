I'm over 30 and I LOVE Harry Potter! These books are just wonderful, every one of them kept me engrossed and surprised right up to the end. Just when I thought I had it figured out, the story would take a turn and I'd be wondering what would happen next again. Beautifully written, and great,  complex characters!<br />As for some of the criticisms, well, makes you  wonder if the same people would give 1 star to the Hobbit, Narnia, and the  Wizard of Oz books, classics that include quite a bit of magic and  wizardry. All of these books have death in them as well, sometimes featured  quite prominently, but I would certainly consider them great children's  books regardless. Harry Potter is certainly in the same vein as these.<br />As for saying it's unrealistic, HELLO!  It's fantasy!  It's not  *supposed* to be completely realistic. Again, I would consider the Lord of  the Rings one of the great books of our time, but you could say it was  unrealistic too, with all the elves and dwarves and wizards. But that  doesn't mean it doesn't draw you into that other world and make you imagine  what it would be like. The characters become real people to you and that's  what makes it great.
