Don't hesitate to buy this because of the length.  Each page is as enjoyable as the last as Harry finds his way to face the inevitable.  The story does indeed start to tap into the romantic side, but doesn't go too  far.  Most of the focus is on the Triwizard Tournament held among three of  the international wizard schools and all the action leading up to and  around it.  For readers of the other 3, all of our favorites are there and  starting to grow up just a bit.  Even if you haven't read the others, this  is nonetheless a joyful read.
