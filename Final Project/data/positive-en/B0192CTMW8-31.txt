What can you say about these Harry Potter books?  They are absolutely wonderful!  J.K. Rowling continues to amaze me with the things she dreams up.  I'm now reading the Prisoner of Azkaban with my sons and they can't get enough of it.  Who would have ever thought that my children, (even a 14  year old boy!) would be waiting for me when I get home from work asking if  there would be enough time to read tonight!  I know there's some  controversy surrounding these books, but what's the harm?  It's only the  age old battle of good against evil.  They also teach a valuable lesson:  that is, that evil doesn't always look bad on the outside.  Sometimes the  bad guy doesn't look like a bad guy till you get to know him.  I'm all for  the spell that these books weave!  It's made my kids love reading, and is  great quality time for us!  This book was just as good as the first if not  better!
