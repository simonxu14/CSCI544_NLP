...this is still a fun-to-read fantasy and as charming and deserving of all the hype!  I never read any of the others in the series, but this one was enough that I don't feel like a complete failure when it comes to the pop culture phenomenon of Harry Potter.  Breezy, amusing and whimsical.  Oh, yeah...and better than the movie!
