This book is amazing. I started playing Pok&eacute;mon go as a way to bond with my 7 year old who's obsessed with the shows. Other than what I've seen in the game, I don't know anything about Pok&eacute;mon. This book made my son so happy, and it's been nice to look at it together, while he tells me who evolves into what.
