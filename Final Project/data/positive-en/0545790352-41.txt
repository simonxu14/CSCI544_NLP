I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series. I started reading them in 1998, when I was 13. Now, at 31, I am just as in love with the world and characters as ever. When I saw this book in Barnes & Noble, I HAD to have it. I chose to buy it online because it was cheaper (I bought a new one). When it arrived, all I could do for a while was stroke the cover and pages and coo at how beautiful it was. I felt a little traitorous in loving the illustrations so much (sorry Mary Grandpre, lol), but I got over that. I own all of the other books, but I really love this version. Not only because it is beautiful, but because it is a format that I can read to my 5 year old son. I can't wait for him to love the books as much as I do. I will be buying every illustrated version that is produced.
