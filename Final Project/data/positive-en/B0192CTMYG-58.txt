I have already read the seven books of HP like 4 times and I decided to do my English 10 honors assignment on HP because I love HP. I didn't own any books and I don't have a library and even though I checked out a book, I can't make notes on it for annotations. SO I decided buy it and when it got here, can I just say AMAZING. There were no dents, marks, ripped pages, or anything like that. It really looks like I just bought it from a bookstore. It feels, looks, and even SMELLS like a brand new book that was not used. I love it!
