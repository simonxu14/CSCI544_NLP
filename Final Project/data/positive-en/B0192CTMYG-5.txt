The book arrived promptly and in excellent condition. For those of you looking for practice material in Arabic that may be interested in the details, this text is not vowelled and appears to be translated into Modern Standard Arabic with some more colloquial expressions in the dialog. English names are spelled out phonetically in Arabic script and put in parentheses, which is amazingly helpful. A good buy, although due to the lack of vowelling (typical in Arabic texts), I would suggest not diving into this as a study tool unless you're pretty well on in your study of Arabic.
