Yes, it's over 700 pages...but I still finished it in onenight. You won't find yourself counting pages left, I promise.<br />Yes,it's up to par.  Rowling continues with some threads she'd started in earlier books... and starts some interesting new ones...<br />Goblet of Fire is a little darker than the earlier books, ...but I still found myself laughing out loud in several spots. If there's anyone left who hasn't read the earlier books, it's best to start at the beginning and work your way through, but Goblet of Fire does have plenty of reminders and explanations of what happened in the earlier books, in case you've forgotten anything.<br />Also, a comment to parents who might be thinking of not letting their children read Goblet of Fire: please consider these points. Do you want to deprive your children of the chance to read a book of both literary and moral value that is still fun to read? Do you really want to keep them away from a book that has turned more non-readers into enthusiastic readers than anything in recent memory?  Do you want to keep them from a story that teaches loyalty, perseverance, courage, and the value of learning and of independent thought?...  END
