I bought his for my 7 year old. She hasn't put it down. Actually unless you want to scold your kid for hiding it in their backpack to take to school or sneaking it to bed to study the different characters, don't buy it! I let her pick any special book she wanted as she has tons and she wanted this as she collects the cards too. I would call it a winner.
