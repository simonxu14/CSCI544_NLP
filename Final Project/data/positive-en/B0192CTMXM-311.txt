I am a TOTAL Harry Potter fan, and have already read all of the books awhile ago. When I saw the final movie I was super bummed to think that the saga was finally over... so I wanted to be able to read the book again but thought it would be cool do the book on CD. I have been listening for awhile now and absolutely love these CD's!!! I listen to them all the time, on my i-pod, on my lap top and in my car!!! I love being able to hear the book being read by Jim Dale too, he does the best impressions and hearing the parts read aloud and in there own voices makes this such an awesome interactive experience!!! I cannot get enough! I will for sure be getting the whole lot of CD's to re-read all the books from beginning to end to re-live the whole Harry Potter world all over again.(by the way, these are totally better than reading the books on your own!!!) It is such a blast, cannot say enough good things about them! JIM DALE ROCKS!
