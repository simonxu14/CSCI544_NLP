At this time, there are 1198 reviews on amazon.com for this, the last of Harry Potter series, so it's pretty unlikely anyone's going to be reading this. Take home message- I can be as brutally honest as I like :) hehe<br /><br />1. It's too long. Too much wedding talk. Too much lost in the wilderness and bickering stuff.<br /><br />2. The last third of the book has it all. The setting, the battle between good and evil, the inside scoop on the two most important players of the Order of the Phoenix. And no, it's not Harry.<br /><br />3. JK Rowling did an excellent job in not only providing all the answers, but fleshing them out, giving depth and soul to it.<br /><br />4. One of the biggest loopholes I've found is that muggles seem to be oblivious to the Magic world. But how can that be, when hundreds of the wizards are mudbloods, which means, over the last few hundred years, millions of muggles parents have had children attend Hogwarts. And the muggle parents dont have their memories altered. Hermione's didnt- they knew perfectly well she was magical and took her to the train bound for Hogwarts every year.<br /><br />5. Overall- if you've read the first 6 books, read this one, the last of an epic series. After all, a series that made a penniless single mother a billionaire must have some style and merit about it.:)<br /><br />6. I've wanted to say this for a long time. The guy who divorced JK Rowling before she penned Harry Potter must feel like a real loser and twit these days. I can see people asking him every second day for the rest of his life- do you regret divorcing her? She's a billionaire, what are you?
