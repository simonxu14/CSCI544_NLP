I absolutely love this book!<br /><br />J.K. Rowling never fails to impress her readers. I have read all the Harry Potter books, and while each of them are thoroughly enjoyable, I must admit that Deathly Hallows is my favorite!<br /><br />This book is very well written. It is supposed to be Harry's last and final year at Hogwarts, and all the questions that anxious Harry Potter fans have been waiting to know the answer to will be revealed!<br /><br />* Who is the mysterious R.A.B.?<br />* Severus Snape- friend or foe?<br />* Who will live? Who will die?<br />* And will Voldemort prevail?
