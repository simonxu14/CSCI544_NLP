Brilliant, fantastic, and sad to see end.  This book was excellent and answered questions, gave affirmations, and was hard to put down.  I feel like I'm leaving some friends behind but that we will always have some connection.  In a time of video games and bad tv it's so good to see books like this captivate both young and old.
