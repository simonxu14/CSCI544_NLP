The Harry Potter books grabbed you from book one and always left you wanting the next one now so that you could keep reading to see what was going to happen next.  This one was off and running from page one and kept on going full speed ahead.  She had a lot to cover and put all together and she did a fabulous job.  It is sad that we have come to the end of these books.  Now I will have to find something else to keep my children reading.
