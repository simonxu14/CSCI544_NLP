No need to speak to the converted, so on behalf of our daughter, Sasha [10 years old next month] we want to send a big 'Thank-you' to Amazon.com for getting the 'Phoenix' here precisely on schedule. [How did you DO that, anyway?]<br />Sasha finished the book today [Tuesday, June 24th] at 2:45PM - and that's after having lost the 'priviledge' of reading it for the entire day, Sunday!!! [No, she does NOT sleep under the stairs, but it seems a day without H-P-5 is about the only thing that gets her attention lately...anyway, she still has the other 4 which she constantly re-reads]<br />All joking aside, even we are impressed with her reading speed this time not to mention the obvious quality of the Harry Potter characters and story lines.<br />Sincerely,<br />Patrice Stanton and James Lenaburg
