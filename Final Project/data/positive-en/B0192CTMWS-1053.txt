Granted I didn't jump on the Harry Potter bandwagon until around 6 months ago.  I ADORE this series, and I will admit I am not in the intended age range here.I am 26 years of age, but I can't wait to get to the next book.  I think these books are the most imaginative I have read since the Narnia Chronicles when I was young. For a year or so, I thought these were just for kids.  Yet one day I took the plunge, and now I will not turn back until I have read all the forthcoming Harry Potter books. I recommend it to everyone, young and old alike!
