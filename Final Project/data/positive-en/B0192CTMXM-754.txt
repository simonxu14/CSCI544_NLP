It took me about 16 hours to read start to finish (not bad for almost 900 pages). This book is a satisfactory followup to the previous set and as we would say in my doctoral program of child development--he(Harry) has reached formal logic. He can analyze situations with new logic and understanding but still has a childish egocentric view. Harry is painted as emotional and moody with a lot of anger (not surprising given his history) and angst. Harry's fifth year is very difficult, by homework, upcoming OWL's (special final exams-Ordinary Wizarding Levels), and by political type confilct occurring between Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic. If you are not a child reader (as I am not) this is beyond time to get into this series. Harry is portrayed as a typical 15-year-old boy and yet as the shining hope that he was born to be. As for other fans, I didn't "enjoy" this book as well as the others because it is dark, but it is a necessary component, I feel, of telling a coming of age tale in a boy's life who has had a dark past and is prophecized to have a difficult future as well.
