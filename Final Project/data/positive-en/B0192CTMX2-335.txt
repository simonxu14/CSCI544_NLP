J.K. Rowling has yet to disappoint.  In this seventh (&last?) installment in the saga of Harry Potter, she really picks up the pace, leading our favorite sorceror's apprentice from one perilous leap to the next with rollercoaster rhythm & speed.  There are more than a few sad moments & endings, &, in this, Rowling doesn't insult her readers' intelligence with "happily-ever-afters".  Die-hard fans will, I think, be satisfied - I, for one, am looking forward to the film rendition of the "Battle of Hogwarts"!  I know this is supposed to be the final book, but I don't think it's my imagination that an opening was left for the next generation to carry on the battle against the forces of evil.  The final line says it all.  Will the boy-wizard return?  Stay tuned.
