J.K.Rowling has indeed made us wait long and hard for her fifth installment of the journey of Harry Potter.  I thank her for taking the time and attention to detail that makes Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix more than worth the wait.  Rowling's writing has matured as much as Harry himself.  I read the novel in a little more than 24 hours, and so much enjoyed her narrative, that I have already begun my second read.  Order of the Phoenix book is darker than the previous stories, and rightly so.  Harry is at such a volatile stage in his life, not only in his wizadry studies, but also in his journey into manhood.  Rowling takes such care with his emotions and his loss of innocence that one cannot feel anything but empathy for Harry.  So many questions are answered from the previous stories, and happily, more questions are raised.  I can't rave enough about the writing, the story, and the timing of this novel.<br />J.K.Rowling must have read President Bush's "No Child Left Behind Act" while constructing the beurocratic blowhard, Professor Umbridge. She would have worked perfectly in today's high accoutability atmosphere of the new education act.  I can only hope the new education act shares the same fate as Umbridge.<br />Thank you Ms. Rowling!!!
