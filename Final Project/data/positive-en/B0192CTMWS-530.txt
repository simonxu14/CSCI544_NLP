I feel like I just ate a small portion of my favorite food and I know that can not have more for ???? I feel compelled to chat about the book a bit:<br />For me, the best aspect of the book was the character development (and likely set-up for greater things to come) around Ginny Weasley and Neville Longbottom---these two have both lived through some scary and tough things as children and they are shoring up nicely ---I thought that Ginny on the Quidditch team was more significant than Ron's joining which was announced pre-publication. I am glad that she is not being stereo-typed as a "weaker little sister" needing protection. I also like the obvious (this is a kid's story at its core) message about unity and banding together across school "houses."  The second generation of the "order" story line (the D.A.) is more suited to the younger audience for the series. Some parents thought that Book IV was too scary for their elementary age kids (me included)but I frankly found Book V to be less so.  Dissappointing for some adult readers (me included), but more in keeping with the original tone of the series.<br />I won't spoil who the "killed off" character is, but I have to say that I think it was a good choice.  The books needed the sense of how seriously dangerous these "adventures" are---and there was not much a future for real contribution from this character unless other circumstances were to be changed around alot.<br />It was disturbing going through the book in one sense because Harry really has NO HAPPINESS in this book.  While less scary, it borders on something more appropriately labeled "dark"--I kept wanting a bit more comic relief, but artistically it was probably the right choice to have less humor here.  Still, it's a page turner to the end, and I will be waiting for the chance to sign up for my next installment.
