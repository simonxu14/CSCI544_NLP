I got this book today, and have already finished it!  I started it and could not stop!  Anyone who has something bad to say about the book, is out of their mind!  They just can't handle is popularity! The book starts off  with the Quidditch World Cup, (I wont give the entire book away, that way  you can enjoy it as much as I have!), and ends with a dramatic conclusion!  Put everything aside in your life and read this book, I know it will be the  best book you have ever read!  Congrats to J.K. Rowling!  Keep up the  good work, and I cant wait until the next book!<br />Chris Carlson
