What is there to say - if you are considering buying Book 7 then you must have read the others.  This book ties EVERYTHING together in such a tidy way there couldn't have been a better conclusion.  JK Rowling's best book in my opinion and the epilogue at the end of the book is wonderful and I am very glad she included it.
