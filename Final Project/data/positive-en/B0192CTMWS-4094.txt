Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows is terrific read.  It only took me roughly five hours over two days to read book.  J. K. Rowling is to be commended for how satisfactorily she has concluded the Harry Potter saga.  I did not know what to expect and avoided reading any news articles that might give any detail away.  I only knew that several characters would die.  It was really sad to see Dobby the house elf and Fred get killed.  The twins were always larger than life and found so many business schemes that I thought they would live a long time.  Poor Harry really had a tough time losing these two friends as well as Lupin and Tonks.<br /><br />It was a fascinating ploy to have Voldemort and Harry sharing parts of each other.  It is hardly surprising then that Voldemort hated and feared Harry so much.  I was not surprised that Severus Snape was Dumbledore's agent instead of belonging to Voldemort.  The films made it too obvious that he hated Harry.<br /><br />At last Neville Longbottom came into his own.  I always suspected that he was not as clumsy or lacking in magic as he was portrayed in the first two films and in the books.<br /><br />Harry really learned the true meaning of friendship thanks to the many who fought for him and those who died believing him to be better than Voldemort.<br /><br />The final duel between Harry and Voldemort was exciting and sobering.  Harry showed his maturity and how much he had learned about magic in not sneering at Voldemort but instead calmly, quietly explained the things that Tom Riddle/Voldemort never learned about the power of love.<br /><br />I was delighted by the section titled Nineteen Years Later.  I had hoped that Ginny and Harry would marry as would Hermione and Ron.  Their assorted children certainly sound interesting.  I wonder if J.K. Rowling will leave the Potter world alone or if at some point she will write about the adventures of the Potter and Weasley children at Hogwarts.
