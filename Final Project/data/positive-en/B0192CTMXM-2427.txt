Well, if most readers have gotten to this point in the series and have read the first two books, I don't think they need much convincing or assistance from any review to know that this one is as good, if not even  better than the others.  There aren't many books on the bestseller lists  today that are truly feel-good-happy-type reads, but Harry Potter is  definitely one of them.  It is so wonderful to just sit down and read a fun  story for once, so, to all the other Muggles, if you haven't joined the  Potter craze yet, please do so :)
