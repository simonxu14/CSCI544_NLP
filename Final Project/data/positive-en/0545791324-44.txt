Jim kay did it again with amazing illustrations. He really catches the feel of the book and i love his renditions of the characters.  I like the way that some chapters are white text on black pages.  It really brings a irienrss to the spooky parts of the book.  I can only imagine what it would be like to read these stories for the first time with these illustrations; it would be so much more engaging and suck me in even more than the amazing story did.
