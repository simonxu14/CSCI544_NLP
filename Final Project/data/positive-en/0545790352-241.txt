This book got my reluctant reader to start down the Harry Potter path!  This is not a picture book or graphic novel, by any means, but my younger daughter has always been a reluctant reader and has never been interested in reading the Harry Potter series before.  She was happy just watching the movies. And, while they are good, everyone knows that so much more happens in the books.  We've tried not to force anything on her in the hopes that she would develop a love for reading like the rest of us. She told me last night that she'd finished the first book and couldn't wait to read the second one.  I think she's going to wait for the next illustrated book to come out even though we have the whole collection already in our library!<br /><br />The illustrations are great and there is something on every page.
