The beginning of an astonishingly epic story!!! While I was growing up, and I first heard about these books/movies, I was not allowed to watch or read them. But that all changed when I picked up a copy from a book fair back in 8th grade in the school library. Read it and have loved it. Loved it so much I had to continue with the other six entries in this series.<br /><br />So as everyone here knows the whole story about Harry Potter by now, we are about to get an eighth entry but set in the 19 years after the events of Deathly Hallows. And we are also getting another movie set in the Potter universe but taking place about 70 years before the events of Sorcerer's Stone.<br /><br />While living a life with his nasty aunt and uncle, young Harry's life is changed forever when he receives a letter from Hogwarts while being enrolled. Thanks to friendly half-giant Hagrid, Harry learns that he is famous because of his defeat of a Dark wizard named Lord Voldemort, who is revealed to have killed his parents.<br /><br />The amazing storytelling from Rowling brings to life something beyond imagination itself which has captured the hearts of many for several years.<br /><br />A great character example is Harry himself. Thus since he is probably the driving force for the whole story, he comes across several twists and turns in this and the six sequel stories that brings him to his ultimate destiny in episode 7. And with new friends and foes, Harry definitely is one we can relate to because at some point in our lives, we have been where he is when the story starts. And when he talks to the boa constrictor in chapter 2, I wanted to laugh when Dudley (his cousin fell into the pond) as the glass vanished.<br /><br />So this is the introduction to a whole other world within our own with Diagon Alley, Quidditch, muggles and so much more. It is an excellent way to introduce readers to this magical world.<br /><br />But another driving force throughout the whole series is that there is a whole slew of mysterious events in each individual entry. In this installment, Harry claims that his Potions teacher Professor Snape is after a magical relic called the Sorcerer's Stone. But as the story goes on it is revealed that the true villain (aside from Voldemort himself) is actually Professor Quirrell. Another thing I liked is while Voldemort is the true villain of the series as a whole, there are a few side characters in each entry who serve as the main villain individually. They either serve Voldemort directly or they serve the Ministry of Magic (in Book 5 more prominently).<br /><br />The last thing I like about this and the other books is that it is about development. As the series goes on, we follow Harry, Ron and Hermione as they mature in each story. In this one, they have already met (around chapter 6) and are ready for what awaits them.<br /><br />So thus begins the story of Harry Potter!!!
