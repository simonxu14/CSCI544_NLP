The last three books in this series are my favorite because of the change in tone.  It has a touch of dark fantasy.  Readers learn more of the connection between Harry and Voldermort and the importance of the meeting that is to come.  My only complaint is that the book's pacing slows in the middle.<br /><br />The movie adapation remedied this, though it left things out.
