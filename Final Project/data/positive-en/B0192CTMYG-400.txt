I have had this book on the shelf to read for a while and finally picked it up and read it.  Let me say from the minute I picked it up I didn't want to put it down.  It was truely a book for all ages, and thoroughly well written.<br />I can't wait to read the rest of the series, I am hooked now and there is no stopping me.  I can't wait to have children to read these stories to.
