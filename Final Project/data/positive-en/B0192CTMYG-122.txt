Ok, so I'm a Harry Potter nut and have collected all seven hardcover books.  The first, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, will hook you and send you and your children and grandchildren on a wonderful journey.  I shopped Amazon used books and found books in wonderful condition and inexpensively too.
