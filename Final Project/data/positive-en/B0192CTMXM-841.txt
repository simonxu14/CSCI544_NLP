Since I saw the movie version(s) of this last book before reading it, I wasn't sure how the book would compare. I was pleased to find that the book was even better than the movies, and a much more satisfying and fully explanatory conclusion to the great series. Overall, this series has to be one of the most well-written collections of books published in a long time.
