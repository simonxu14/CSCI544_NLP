Stunning! Gorgeous! Genius!<br /><br />I have run out of superlatives for this book. It's wonderful- the illustrations are gorgeous and only add the the experience, some are down-right heartbreaking.<br /><br />The book itself is big with thick glossy pages with art on just about every page.<br /><br />I received my copy today and after flipping through it twice I ordered another copy just so I can have one that sits on the self not to be touched.
