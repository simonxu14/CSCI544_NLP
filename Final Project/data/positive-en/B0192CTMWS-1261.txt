Although I was saddened to get this book as it was the last in the series, once again JK Rowling pulled me into Harry's magical world and I was devastated to leave it. I actually read the book in one day. I had not planned to do that but I could not put it down. Kids and adults alike will love this last adventure for Harry, Ron and Hermione!
