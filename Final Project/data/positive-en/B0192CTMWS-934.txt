Sadly, the Harry Potter series is at an end. But what an end!!<br /><br />J.K.Rowling has done an incredible job on these books, and I highly recommend them to adults as well as teens. (I would not even read them to kids under 12 or 13 - requires a good grounding in reality before they can deal with much of the imagery.)<br /><br />I won't summarize the series - if you haven't read the book, I won't spoil them for you. Some people, however, are comparing Harry Potter to Aslan! Which makes some kind of sense, especially given the events in the last book.<br /><br />Well conceived, well written, well completed. All I can say is if you enjoy fantasy, you will truly enjoy these books. The only problem is, they are completed! There won't be anymore. Just RATZ!
