I don't know how she does it, but J.K. Rowling is a true witch with her words. Harry Potter Book 5 is yet another amazing tale, with a plot so exciting nothign can match it. Even from the beginning, Rowling is sure to put a sence of adventure in this book. AND, we finally get SO many questions about Potter answered.<br />However good the plot, descriptive details, etc, Rowling does make two mistakes. Oneshe wastes too mcuh time teling Harry's thoughts when unnesscary, and she kills off the wrong charactor. (If you want to find out who, read the book!)
