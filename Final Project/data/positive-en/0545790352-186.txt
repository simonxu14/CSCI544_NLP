I got this book today. It is gorgeous! The pictures bring the Harry Potter book to life. The details in this book is  very visual and colorful. This book will be great for children who have yet to experience the series. This will be good as  a read aloud for children. I cannot wait for the other 6 books in the series. Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix is going to be massive! I recommend this book to anyone who loves Harry Potter wether you grew up with the series in the late 90's, you watched the movies, or are a newcomer to the fandom. You will not be disappointed in this product. You have done it again J.K Rowling. Take all my money.
