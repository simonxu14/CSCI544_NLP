Best book ever!!! I am ten years old and my mom read all these books to me. I have loved  them since the moment my mom started to read them to me. Now I read them on my own and I still love them. I just love all the characters like Harry,Hermione,Ron,Hagrid,and Dumbledore. I even love the bad characters such as Snape,Dudley,and Mrs.and Mr.Dursley. I just love all the magic and spells it is just so awesome. I recommend this book for all ages from 8 and up.  (Moms you can and really should read this book to your 5 year olds and six year olds.)
