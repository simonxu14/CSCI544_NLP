The seventh and intended final book of the series sees Harry become an adult, which happens at age 17 for wizards.  Once more, the evil Voldemort is intent on taking over, with his Death Eaters and Dementors backing him.  Harry, of course, has other ideas.  While he no longer has his adult supporters of Sirius Black, Dumbledore, and others, Hermione and (most of the time) Ron remain firmly at his side.  They still have allies out there, but they're scattered and oppressed by Voldemort, whose minions now control the Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts.  In mounting an offensive against the evil Lord, Harry is faced with the problem of whether to pursue the course Dumbledore assigned him, the finding and destroying of horcruxes, objects containing portions of Voldemort's spirit, or the three (legendary?) components of the Deathly Hallows which give anyone holding all three great powers.  While wrestling with this choice, he is also challenged by being the most wanted individual in the wizarding world, and so, safety becomes paramount and problematical.  Many locations and characters from the first six books show up here.  For this reader, Dolores Umbridge rivals Voldemort in pure nastiness, but there are other nastiness contenders, Bellatrix Lestrange and others.  There are good guys, too and also resolution to the main good guy/bad guy paradox of Severus Snape.  And, yes, there are deaths, some very moving.  As a whole, Deathly Hallows is about Harry and friends getting into very sticky situations, and Rowling providing fascinating means of addressing those situations on a regular basis.  It's a wonderful quest story, with necessary rapid changes of location, battles, good and evil, and resolution for the younger readers who are Potter book fans.  Knowing its predecessors definitely makes this ending  volume more meaningful.  Great ending to a great series.
