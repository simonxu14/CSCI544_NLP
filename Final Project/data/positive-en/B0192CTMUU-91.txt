J.K. Rowling does it again.  Goblet of Fire, book 4 in the Harry Potter series, is as engaging and thrilling as its three predecessors.  I have read many books in series by other authors and have always found that  sequels never quite achieve the novelty and excitement of the first book in  the series.  Not so with Harry Potter.  Each book in the story is fresh,  introducing new characters and situations involving Harry and his  extraordinary friends.  Many have said that this book is &quot;darker&quot;  and not as appropriate for children as the previous three.  I believe that  the story line merely reflects Harry's entrance into adolecence.  As an  adult I find these books refreshing, captivating and a phenomenal read.  I  have finally turned the book over to my 9 year old who unfortunately had to  wait for me to finish before starting &quot;her&quot; book!  For those of  you who may be interested, this book and series provide a literary banquet.  Happy Reading Muggles!
