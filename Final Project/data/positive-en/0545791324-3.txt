Before I start this review, can we just take a second and rejoice in the amount of Harry Potter-related stuff we're getting this year?  *Screams in excitement*<br /><br />Ok, Now, on to this review!<br /><br />I  have been anxiously awaiting the release of the illustrated edition of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets since I finished the illustrated version of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone!  Some people might wonder why I'd buy another version of any of the Harry Potter books, but this is an absolute MUST HAVE if you even so much as LOVE Harry Potter and the wizarding world in general.  Jim Kay has always brought JK Rowling's wizarding world to life, but these illustrated editions just take it to a whole new, exciting, and fantastic level.<br /><br />Part of the joy of reading (at least for me) has always been bringing the words on pages alive in my own imagination.  This may seem counterintuitive to my raving review, but what if I told you that almost everything illustrated was at the very least close to what I had always imagined? It's probably part of the brilliance of JKR's vibrant descriptions, but it's still pretty cool when you see them.<br /><br />The illustrated edition of Chamber of Secrets is phenomenal in short.  Inside the cover you see the Hogwarts Greenhouses, and it only gets better from there! I would like to say I could totally use LESS of the illustrations of the acromantuals!  GROSS! Not only are they all over the contents pages, but there are WAY too many full page(s) photos of these gross spiders!  PASS!  My two favorites though are the illustrations of the phoenix and of Dobby!<br /><br />I could laude over the illustrations for a year, but I won't.  What I love about this book (and for the whole collection of illustrated editions I hope!) is that this is the version I can see first introducing my (future) children to Harry Potter with.  I put these on my bookshelves waiting for the day when I can show my kids the wonderful world that has filled my life with such fun and fantasy.<br /><br />The book DOES include the full text of Chamber of Secrets in case any of you were wondering, it just also includes some fantastic illustrations from Jim Kay!<br /><br />If you love Harry Potter, don't hesitate.  Collect these editions! You and your family will love this for a long, long time!
