I have read many books in my day including all Harry Potter books and Beedle the Bard prior to reading the Deathly Hallows.  Never, never has any book kept my attention as much as Deathly Hallows.  You will "actively" feel every emotion while reading this rivoting book, and I mean "actively".  J. K. Rowling is one great and gifted author whose imagination rivals the Brothers Grimm and Aesop.  I wait impatiently for the next two movies.
