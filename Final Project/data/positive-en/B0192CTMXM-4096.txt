I believe it was my favorite of all seven books.<br /><br />It was terribly, terribly sad in many ways, with so many good characters, some of whom I obviously REALLY loved, dying. But I think the balance was good. She didn't kill so many characters that it felt gratuitous, but she killed enough characters, well loved and often important characters, so that it wasn't trite. After all, they are fighting a war. If no one but "red-shirts" died, it would have seemed stupid and false.<br /><br />And though it shocked and saddened me at the time, I was also glad that not every death was the result of some amazing act of heroism or imprisonment by "the enemy" and such. As in real life war, characters die just for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, with no rhyme or reason or ability to say "yes, but they died fighting" or "they died for what they believe in". Some times there's nothing to comfort yourself with.<br /><br />My favorite things about this book was the fact that it felt more 3-dimensional to me. We've always know, or have learned a decent amount about some characters' motives, like Harry and Voldemort. But other characters have been very flat - divided into good or evil as though those things exist in a vacuum. In this book, she really tells us more about a number of the characters. She explores the fact that no one is all good or all bad, and that sometimes our perception of people is drastically mistaken, both for better and for worse, because we don't know how they arrived at the place they are at the time we come to know them. We realize - if we had been faced with similar situations as they had been, how differently would we ourselves have been able to act? The world and characters just seem some much more real now that we can see their secret redemptions, as well as their unsuspected flaws.<br /><br />I also really enjoyed the way she dealt with destroying the Horcruxes. Not so much the method as the.... "circumstances", I guess would be the best way to say it without giving too much away. Again, I thought it resonated perfectly with the theme of the book about being careful to judge things in black and white terms - good versus evil, hero versus sidekick, teamwork versus going it alone, etc.<br /><br />It was a wonderful, if bittersweet ending to a wonderful series of books.
