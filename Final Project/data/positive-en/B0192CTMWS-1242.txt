I ordered this because Harry Potter is one of my favorite book series and I have read them repeatedly. I do not like to give my hard cover books a beating bc of their cost and value so I was very excited to finally be able to have book 7 in paperback for frequent re-reading. I recieved my order witin 3 days and the book came in perfect condition, as promised.
