This series means so much to our family.  I read it aloud to my kids starting in kindergarten and read every one aloud to them until this one, by which time they had long outgrown the read aloud on the bed habit.  At the same time, I sent each new edition to my grandmother, age 70s-90.  What a great multi-generational bridge. She and I talked about them, she talked to her great grandchildren about them ... these are a wonderful read.  After watching the movie, I read it (to myself) again for the third time just to recall the details.  These books just don't get old but the best thing about books is that its not just the story you remember but also all of these other things tied into the time, place and manner through which you experienced the book.
