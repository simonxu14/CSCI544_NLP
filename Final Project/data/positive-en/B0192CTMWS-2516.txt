Well, I've finally finished it and can re-enter the world again!  The fifth installment of the Harry Potter series is definitely good, but not my favorite (that prize still goes to Book #4).  As is Harry, the book series is maturing.  This one dwells on Harry's adolescence, which Muggles will be relieved to learn is as difficult for Wizards and Witches as for themselves.  Harry experiences so much trauma and self doubt, though, that after a while it's hard to read.  What I prized most in the earlier books was his reliance on his friends, and the lesson that loyalty and honesty are valuable traits.  It's not so clear in this one.  Harry doubts everything and everyone, all the time.  His outbursts, while understandable, grow old after a while.  He spends a great deal of this book shouting at anyone who will listen.  Ron and Hermione take a lot of abuse in this installment.  (and honestly, every boy should have a friend like Hermione to translate when encountering girls!)  Yes, all of this is part of growing up, and really was understandable, I guess I just wish the angst had been a little less overwhelming.  One of the better parts of this book is an even larger view of the Wizard world, with forays into the Ministry of Magic, a wizard house right in London, and more glimpses into the Weasley family life.  Of course it has a killer fight at the end (no pun intended!) and even though he reveals imperfection, I'm more in love with Dumbledore than ever.  The story seems to be setting up the next two, so I still can't wait to read them.  I just hope Harry has matured (mellowed?) even more, as the books seem to do with each progressive installment.
