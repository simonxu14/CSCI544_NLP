Some people say the Harry Potter books are for kids. Nonsense. They are for anyone who enjoys great plotting, dry wit, and characters you can truly care about. &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; is longer than  most adult books yet kids and adults alike can't wait to read it.  Amazon.com was nice enough to FedEx my copy to me yesterday, July 8, and I  finished it before bedtime, pausing after every chapter to let what had  transpired sink in. I laughed out loud. I worried along with Harry about  the safety of his friends. And I even admit to a tear in my eye at one  point. Isn't that what a great book is supposed to do -- take you on an  imaginative ride that's outside the sphere of your normal life? That's what  this book did for me and will probably do for anyone who doesn't judge a  book by the age range that some reviewers attach to it. Critics carp that  the Harry Potter hype has overshadowed the books themselves. Nonsense.  Don't read Harry Potter because the media tells you to; read it because it  has charm and joy and humor and everything that makes life so wonderful!
