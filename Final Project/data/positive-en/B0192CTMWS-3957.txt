It was with both longing and dismay that I opened up the final book of this magical series.  But now that I've finished it, I don't think Rowling could have done it any better.  I won't post any spoilers (even though I'm sure others have done so) but I will say that I'm so glad the truth behind Severus Snape was finally revealed, and in such a beautiful, heart-wrenching way.  I'm so sorry to see the magic ending, but I'm glad I was along for the ride every step of the way.
