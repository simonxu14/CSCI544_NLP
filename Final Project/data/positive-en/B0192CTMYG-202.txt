I purchased this audio edition to listen to while knitting, after seeing interviews with J.K. Rowling on TV. I have not been disappointed - the story is fun, interesting, and imaginitive... not to mention very  entertaining, even for adults! In the tradition of C.S. Lewis or Madeleine  L'Engle's imaginary realms... although this Harry Potter book (and, I  assume, the others) don't have a religious message, ethics such as sticking  up for your friends in need, trying things even when you're afraid, dealing  with loneliness, and other universal issues are covered. Wonderful fun!
