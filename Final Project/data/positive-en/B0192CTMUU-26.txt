I too am one of the many adults out there that truely enjoy the Harry Potter story.  I have listened to all four books.  This one is wonderful!  Jim Dale is one of the best narrators around.  I cannot believe that he can  come up with a different voice for each and every character. For those of  you that have read the book, I recommend listening to it also.  Jim Dale  adds to the entertainment value.
