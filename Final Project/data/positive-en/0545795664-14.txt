First of all, my 9 year old son LOVES Pokemon and has been begging for me to get this book for him.  I finally gave in and got it for him and so very glad that I did.  This book is amazing!  If you do not know much about Pokemon and just starting off, this book is def a necessity.  Everything you need to know about Pokemon is inside this handbook!  It is full of information and beautiful pictures.  It has 432 pages total, it is in English, the publisher is Scholastic, the age range is between 7-10 years old but really anyone can get this handbook(my 4 year old even wants it).  The grade level for this book is grades 2-5, but really it does not matter what grade you are in.<br /><br />I recommend this Pokemon handbook to anyone who likes Pokemon and is wanting to know all there is to know about Pokemon.
