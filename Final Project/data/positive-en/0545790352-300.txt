The illustrations in this book are gorgeous. I have been a Harry Potter fan for a long time and I absolutely LOVE this book.  It is truly a masterpiece with every page turn.  The story itself is timeless and will be read and re-read by myself and my family for years to come. Definitely worth paying the additional cost for the illustrated version if you are a fan or have younger children who love the story.  It is a surprisingly large book.
