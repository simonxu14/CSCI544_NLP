It's so beautiful.  I didn't realize it would still be the entire unabridged version of the story, so I was pleasantly surprised.  The pictures are delightful and not based on the movies.  They are more concept art-like than movie-based, which is great.  It's a nice, text-book sized book.  It's hefty, but not too heavy.  It has a nice ribbon place marker.  This is a wonderful way to introduce younger children to Harry Potter, if they aren't ready for reading the books to themselves yet.  I hear that they plan to release subsequent books each year.  It should be a nice set.
