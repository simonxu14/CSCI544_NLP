As a Harry Potter fan, I was looking forward to book 7, but at the same time, I didn't think I was ready for the end of the series.<br /><br />I must say that JK Rowling did not dissapoint me at all with this book.<br /><br />There was so much to take in and feel for every single character in the book. It was non-stop all the way through and I feel a little drained from reading it, but it was well worth it.<br /><br />I can say that it was absolutely spectacular, a true literary adventure, and I am very content with how it ended. I feel happy, yet very sad all at the same time.<br /><br />All hail JK Rowling because she deserves it. I tip my hat to her.
