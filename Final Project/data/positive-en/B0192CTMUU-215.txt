Harry is entering his fourth year at Hogwarts. There are two big events coming up.  The first is the World Quidditch Finals, held just before term starts.  The match is between Bulgaria and Ireland.  After the match, Voldemort's sign is seen in the sky, and the masked Death Eaters go on a rampage.  When term begins, a tournament between the threee most prominent wizarding schools is announced.  Only wizards seventeen and older are eligible.  Somehow thirteen year old Harry's name is put into the goblet and he is part of the contest.<br />This is by far the longest of the Potter books and a great deal is happening throughout.  I am going to read it again to see what I missed the first time.  As always, these books are entertaining, the story line is consistent, and there is great attention to detail.  Great books for young and old alike.
