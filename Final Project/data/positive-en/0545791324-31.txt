I can't say enough on how awesome this book series is. My 10yr old son read the first one and just loved it. So I got him this second book and he is just so into reading it. A beautiful combination of exhilarating pictures and an exciting story line as we already know have made reading so interesting for my son. He takes it to school to read on his own and it's so popular amongst his classmates they actually look over his shoulder and read along quietly. Both of his teaches RAVE about this book and it's all I can do as well. The only bad thing about these books is the third book in the series doesn't come out for another year. People, these two books are worth every penny and will last for every one of your kids. 6 out of 5 stars for me. Simply amazing. Oh and a little about me...I am just another Amazon user. I do not review often. This is an honest and pure review. I can't wait for him to get the third next October.
