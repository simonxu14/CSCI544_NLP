I remember reading the first book and just not being able to put it down, being totally absorbed by the story and invested in the characters.  Years later, here I am, watching my daughter's eyes light up as her mind catches fire with the same intensity mine did all those years ago.  Her excitement and passion for the books draws me back into the magical world Rowling created; and it feels a bit like coming home, or visiting the relatives on holidays.  Out of the series, this is not the best of the lot; it's not even the second or third.  What is it is, though, is the bones of the story, the foundation and the beginning.  This is a book that my daughter and I have bonded over, that lead to more books and discussions on characters we are coming to love or loathe.  This series of books will be read for many generations.  Of that, there is no doubt.  Rowling is a master at her craft, which I believe is universally acknowledged.<br /><br />This is the book in which you pick up your Team Harry flag.  You know Harry.  You understand him and want desperately what he wants--a place, a feeling, a sense of belonging.  You want that, and you believe in him, right up to the very end.  I love these books and love how obsessed my daughter has become.  I manage to avoid spoilers, although I do twitch a bit when I hear her dog on Snape.
