As always I love listening to Jim Dale read one of my favorite series of books.  He is a master at creating whole characters by a simple change in accent or inflection of voice.<br /><br />What I did notice and it through me for a major loop was that Harry and Hermiones voices both changed in this book.  In track 128 Chapter 16D both of there voices suddenly sound like miny Hagrids.  Then just as strangely they both change back to normal in track 136, Chapter 17E.<br /><br />Let me know if anyone else caught this and if you've heard why it happened.<br /><br />Long live Harry Potter!
