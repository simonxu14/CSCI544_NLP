There is nothing I can say about Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows that hasn't already been said previously. I loved the book. It is a great ending to a very strong series. My only complaint is that it should have had more Luna Lovegood, but she's been my favorite character from her debut, and I have thought that there should be more of her. I would give it 4 stars but for those few silly people that seemed to have forgotten that it is about the journey, not the destination. And that is saying something since the destination was amazing.
