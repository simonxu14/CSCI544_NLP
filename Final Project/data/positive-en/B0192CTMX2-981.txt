How wonderful is &quot;The Prisoner of Azkaban?&quot; I couldn't wait for this book to come out and I wasn't disappointed. Each one of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books leaves you wanting more (in a really good  way.) I have given them to my nieces and my new nephew, who is only 12  weeks old, I wouldn't want him to miss out on these fantastic adventures  when he's old enough to read. So let's celebrate the newest book with some  butterbeer and start checking off the days until the next book comes out.  Congratulations Ms. Rowling.<br />Hogwarts is just a starting place, like  platform 9 and 3/4 is, who knows what's out there if you just start  looking.
