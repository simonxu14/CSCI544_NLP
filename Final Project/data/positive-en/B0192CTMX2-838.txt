Great book! Very well written, great end to the series, leaves the reader satisfied. I got into this series through the movies - constantly had friends telling me to read the books and I'm glad I did! If you like the movies the books give you further dimensions into the world, much more immersive and gives you deeper looks into the worlds of house elves, the other members of the Order of the Phoenix as well as classmates like Neville, Luna, and many others. Also, if you enjoy this series, I also highly recommend the audiobook versions read completely unabridged by Jim Dale. He has a distinct and consistent voice for every character and it is amazing to listen to. I have heard good reviews for the Stephen Fry readings but have yet to listen to them. Seems to be that Brits tend to prefer Stephen Fry while the American audience leans toward Jim Dale. Ironically both readers are British; go figure, haha.
