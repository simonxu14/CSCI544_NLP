I pre-ordered this book and received it immediately upon it's release then proceeded to read it in about 17 consecutive hours.<br /><br />I have no words to describe this book...at least not anything different than what others have said and are saying.  DON'T read this book until you've read the other six. IF you haven't read these books and have only watched the movies then I suggest you get to reading them because they are SOOOO much better than the movies!!!!<br /><br />As for those of you who are plot spoiling, shame on you for being so selfish as to ruin Rowling's hard work by rushing to be the first to pass on the gossip.
