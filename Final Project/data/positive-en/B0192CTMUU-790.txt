It's clear that J.K. Rowling has laid out a plan for all sevenHarry Potter books -- and that plan makes Harry's world aprogressively darker and more dangerous place. As with The Prisoner of Azkaban, the Goblet of Fire sets up events, characters and situations that linger in our memory long after we finish reading the story. That's the mark of great story-telling, regardless of whether that story is aimed at kids or adults.<br />Events from book-to-book are starting to move like an accelerating steamroller. Rowling ends book four with extraordinary momentum. Bring on book five, and make it snappy.
