Well, for a series I didn't even want to read, I am now a total convert.  JK has managed to weave a story thick with love, friendship, choices between right and wrong into one of the best series of all time.  This book caps Harry's story and it doesn't fall short.  As a matter of fact, JK has outdone herself with this one.  This was an excellent end to her tale.  I don't know how she'll ever top it.
