I enjoyed the last book of JK Rowling's Potter Series.  I'm sorry to see it come to an end, but the book closed nicely.  Jim Dale is magnificent! He is incredible in creating such distinctive voices for each character and giving them the emotions portrayed strongly in the books.  Really a treat, this book!
