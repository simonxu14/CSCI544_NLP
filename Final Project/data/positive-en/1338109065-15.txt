Loved the screenplay. J.K Rowling is a wizard at writing. I couldn't put it down and it read so quickly that I thought I had been aliberated through time. Only wish more movies would release the screenplay at the same time as the film. I would love very much to read others BEFORE seeing the picture. Looking forward to experiencing this movie tomorrow. Can't wait for the next &#34;Fantastic Beast&#34; to escape.
