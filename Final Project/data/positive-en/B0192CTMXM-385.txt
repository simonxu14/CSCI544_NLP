This series is that rarest of events: children's books that enchant readers of all ages.  The plots are wonderfully conceived with plenty of twists and turns; the language is beautifully crafted showing a colorful  mastery of description; the characters are multi-dimensional, almost real  and quite believable; and the creatures...it's hard to find words to  describe how magnificent they are.  Containing enough detail, and never too  much, these books will be my gift to many of my friends this holiday  season.
