I COULD NOT be more thrilled about this edition! The size, which is substantially larger than most books, is perfect for gift giving, or as a keepsake; this would make the ultimate gift book for any Potter fan! And while we all know and love the story, this edition is all about the illustrations and the experience. WOW, this book is beautiful. The pages are very sturdy and perfectly glossed, crisp and clean. My favorite part is the illustrations. Almost every page has at least one, and the text of the story works WITH the illustrations; that is, sometimes it wraps around it, others the text is a single column, allowing for more pictures. So well done, I can't wait to have all seven books in this edition. Well worth the cost several times over, in my opinion.
