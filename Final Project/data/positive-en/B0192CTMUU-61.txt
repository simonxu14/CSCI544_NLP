Composed of thrilling surprises along with  an edge-of-your-seat ending, ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&#34; is very good. This book will give its readers a deeper love for the wizarding world, and will give its fans a greater urge to purchase the next three books in the series. My only complaint would be the book itself. The product was labeled as in good condition, but about fifteen of the pages were torn and lazily tapped back, and the book was very dirty, as if its last reader was eating Doritos all over it. The binder, however, seems to be in good shape, and seems durable to read again and again (which definitely will).
