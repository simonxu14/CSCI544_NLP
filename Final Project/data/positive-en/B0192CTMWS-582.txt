These are excellent productions of the Harry Potter books. I definitely recommend them. I found that listening fit closer with the movies than reading usually does. I have time to listen as I drive, but not so much time to just read. Also, listening to Harry Potter on a car trip keeps you from having sleepy spells. It is a great experience if you love driving and reading to do both at once!
