I am so impressed w/Rowling's ability to not only build a suspenseful story, populated by complicated characters, within each book, but her talent for having built it throughout all seven books.  The writing style also grew-up with the books, to match the anticipated aging of her audience, culminating in a very mature book seven, with complex, adult themes about loyalty, love, sacrifice, fear and longing, hope and despair.<br /><br />And, amazingly, she finishes the entire series with a very satisfying ending.  Something nearly impossible for most novelists, even those with a much shorter series of books.<br /><br />As a writer, I am astonished at her accomplishment. Kudos to Rowling.  I thank her for keeping me entertained, mesmerized and generally glued to my seat.<br /><br />I miss Harry, Hermione and Ron already...
