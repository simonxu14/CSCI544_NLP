As with all of the books previously written in the series, J.K. Rowling continues to add mystery and flavor to Harry Potter for all ages to enjoy.  A wonderful and edge-of-the-seat read all throughout and keeps the reader wanting more of the imaginative story.  Although, for me (and I emphasize "for me" as all readers are different), there were certain areas of the book that dragged a bit too long, the complete story was worth reading every word; Rowling does a great job of ensuring that even the smallest detail in the story of Harry Potter is of great importance.  Highly recommended!
