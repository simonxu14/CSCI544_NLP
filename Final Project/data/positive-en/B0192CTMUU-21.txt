Imaginative, though plot elements are often forced and much of the resolution of the plot is provided by long soliloquies, which is lazy writing. The books get progressively more mature, as if they were written for the same audience as it aged. This one is probably best for a child 10 or older (to listen to - reading level I don't know). A lot of it was lost on my 7 year old.
