I am just amazed at J.K. Rowling's continually awesome imagination.  I was hoping, after counting down the days from when I preordered it in February, that I wouldn't be disappointed from hyping myself up too much. I should  have known all along that the book would be as entertaining and magical as  the first three.  Harry starts to do a lot of growing up in this book.  I  wish the series had come out when I was at a similar age as Harry, because  I think that Ms. Rowling has a wonderful knack at portraying the trials of  early adolescence and classmate rivalry.  But the most important point is  that one doesn't have to be a young adult to love the books. I find myself  calling mean people 'muggles'in place of less nice phrases, and wishing  that I could use Summoning Charms when I am too lazy to get off the couch  to get a ringing phone. I can't give enough stars to these books and can't  wait for the fifth book!
