The six previous books had been a wonderful adventure, one that I wanted to share with two my sons when they were old enough.  Would J.K. Rowling end the series in a manner that would taint my experience of Harry's world?<br /><br />Not for an instant.<br /><br />As the climatic installment of a seven book series, the book yields no respite.  The book has moments full of fear and dread, loneliness, joy - it draws tears as well as laughter from the reader.  Surely, the millions around the world that consumed its 700 plus pages in a day or two is a testament to the summons of this book to be read voraciously.<br /><br />Deathly Hallows has a feeling of inevitability throughout.  The beauty of Rowling's final installment (and a tribute to her skill as a writer) is that in Harry's world, the inevitable is never redundant, predictable, or trite.  Events that seemingly must occur do so with a magic that is fitting the fantastic world in which they happen.<br /><br />Just as with any epic tale, the conclusion is not the real reason for telling the story.  The importance of the tale is the journey.  This is one journey that has left me pleasantly satisfied, and eager for my boys to appreciate the magic of Harry Potter.
