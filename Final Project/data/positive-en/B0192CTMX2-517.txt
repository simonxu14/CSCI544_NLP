Jim Dale again provides a wonderful performance of the scores of characters populating the world of Harry Potter.  I am astonished by his skill at switching between multiple voices with only a couple rare lapses.  Anyone disappointed by the movies should consider listening to the audio books for a complete entertainment experience.<br /><br />The 7th book is the finest of the series, and one of the best conclusions to any book series I have read.  I anticipated some surprises by the clues Rowling gave in previous books, but nothing was certain until it actually happened.  You will find surprises in volume 7!  There is lots of action and character development.  Rowling cleverly brings in nearly every living and dead character, creature, and herb that appeared in the previous books.<br /><br />There are several messages to be found in the book.  I will only mention the one generally overlooked - that HISTORY MATTERS.  Such a message may be lost on the majority of people who only live in the moment, but understanding history is the key to understanding the people and problems we must deal with.  History also offers us choices, and an opportunity to repeat what worked and avoid what failed in the past.  Harry's success or failure ultimately depends upon his ability to learn from the history of the people and magic he is facing.  The conclusion of the story hinges upon the insight Harry can achieve.<br /><br />I was surprised by an obvious gaff early in the book - Hermione says she modified her parents memories, then a few pages later, says she has never done a memory charm!<br /><br />The middle section of the book has the characters on the run, and suffering through a painful period of personal growth.  Although essential, this is the least satisfying portion of the book.  Maybe an editor could have offered a few helpful suggestions.<br /><br />The last section of the book is well constructed, even though complex and full of intense action on a grand scale. Rowling chose to edit heavily to keep the pace rapid. Yet, I would have liked more details, particularly about how some favorite characters died. Rowling admitted that she cried over some of these, and perhaps she was trying to spare the readers some of her own grief.<br /><br />The final confrontation is immensely satisfying and seems flawless.  An epilog offers a comfortable close to the entire series.  Rowling leaves a feeling of completion, yet with the option to write more books if she decides to write again.
