Harry Potter's close, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, stands on it's own as a thrilling story about friendship, loyalty, and facing adversity - even death - with courage.  As a close to the wonderful series, JK Rowling leaves avid Potter fans satisfied as she ties up most loose ends, but still leaves the most hard core witches and wizards wanting more.<br /><br />Harry's last adventure is basically about three friends - Harry, Ron, and Hermione - that set out to destroy the face of evil, while growing into themselves as adults.  No big deal.  Through their journey to find and eliminate Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes, they encounter a wizarding world that has put a bounty on Harry's head and Death Eaters at every turn all while facing dormant demons of their own.  They also must learn to come to grips that their own personal heroes are flawed as well.  That the trio's passage into adulthood happens to coincide with saving the wizarding world is no coincidence.  Rowling magestically weaves the trials and tribulations of becoming an adult into a quest to confront our own worst fears and conquer them.<br /><br />Having read all the Potter books multiple times, I can't say whether or not Deathly Hallows is the best of the seven books -- but I can say, with certainty, that this tome features some of Rowling's best work as an author.  Two chapters stand out - The Prince's Tale and The Forest Again -as possibly the best bit of writing in the whole series.<br /><br />I'm not sure if anybody unfamiliar with Harry's adventures should start with the end.  Being that this is the curtain call for the series, there are far too many inside references to the magical world that a new reader just wouldn't understand, even if they happen to be a fan of the films.  Although, on it's own, Deathly Hallows is a beautiful book, but it would be like reading Tolkien's Return of the King without reading either of the first two Lord of the Rings books.<br /><br />I loved the book as I've loved the series and think that anybody that has a passing interest in reading would find Rowling's books both entertaining and perhaps reintroduce what it was like being a teen, without the acne.
