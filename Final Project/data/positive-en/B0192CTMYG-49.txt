Readily of the Harry Potters books as my grandson would let me.  I'm not usually into fantasy with dragons and wizzardsbut I loved watching Harry and friends grow,  I also liked the way Rowling used math, science, and astronomy in the characters.  Great books I hope all kids and adults read at least once.
