Can I give this book more that 5 stars? I love Harry Potter books and this book with the illustrations is just amazing! I have such a hard time putting it down one because it's Harry Potter and two because these illustrations are fantastic.  I have so many pictures in my head about how so and so looks for how the sorting hat looks.  I'm sure many of these are influenced by the movies.  But this illustrator didn't seem to let the movies getting his way. Who came up with such wonderful and unique illustrations good show you a glimpse in to the way that he sees Harry Potter.<br /><br />This is the third set, obviously just the first book is out,  Harry Potter books that we have in our household. If there were more to get they would probably be in our house as well.<br /><br />I love that they have created these books and keeping the fans happy!  I realize it makes money for them so they are happy!<br /><br />The written layout format is slightly different then that's normal filling up the page, from left to right, text this is in four columns layout.  Not that different just thought I would note that.<br /><br />I am always,  always happy to talk Harry Potter and so I am very happy to get to post pictures from my book and to give you my thoughts on this wonderful wonderful book. I can't wait for the next book to come out so I can stare at all the beautiful illustrations.
