At first I saw this book in Edinburgh, Scotland. I really wanted SOMETHING to read, so I just bought the book. After reading it for about 30 minutes, I got really interested in it. It was great! Quite possibly the best book I've ever  read. Then the sequel came out, and I was still there on vacation so  I bought it with no hesitation whatsoever. Anyway, I keep rereading this  book, and it's still great. It just came to my school and EVERYONE's  reading it. The author should get every prize that exists for children's books.
