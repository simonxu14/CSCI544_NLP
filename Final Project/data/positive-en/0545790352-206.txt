I teach struggling readers at the middle school level, and our students have a strong preference for illustrated works.<br /><br />The Harry Potter series has always been extremely friendly to reluctant readers, and the illustrations in this book are gorgeous. The book itself is gorgeous, printed on decent-quality paper with a fine hard red cover and a ribbon to mark one's place.<br /><br />This book has proven to be a high-interest text in my classroom, and is a great 'gateway drug' to the Harry Potter universe and the fantasy genre.
