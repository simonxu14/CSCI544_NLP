I don't know what I could put into a review that would be more telling than the simple fact this is a Harry Potter book written by JK Rowling--it doesn't get any better than that!  I have given the Harry Potter books to several people in my family but this time around I decided to pamper myself and get my own collection for my in home library.  The construction of the book is great, the quality is exceptional for a paper back book.  The story grabs you immediately and never lets go.  It plunges you into Hogwarts and makes you feel as though you are a classmate of Harry Potter.  The writing is exquisite, it allows you to live and breath the experience.  I love movies but they can never compete with the beauty of a wonderfully written story.  This is a two thumbs up story for sure.  It is a book you can read over and over.  Bravo!
