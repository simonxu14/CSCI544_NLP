This book is great at first reading; it's wonderful as it is reread over and over.  J.K. Rowling does an excellent job of wrapping up the series with this book.  To know that she wrote the last 1/3 over ten years ago is amazing and she integrates it so well that you do not realize it was written so long ago.<br /><br />Watching Harry grow and mature, to learn what he must learn if he is to defeat Voldemort, is the heart of this story.  Anyone who has started reading the Harry Potter books must save this for last.  Not because it is the last book, but because it completes the journey started when Harry is left on the Dursley's doorstep.<br /><br />Do not miss this book.
