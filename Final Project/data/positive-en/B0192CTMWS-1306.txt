I've loved this series. I've had a few issues with it, but it was mostly formula things that are not unique to Harry Potter. Chief of those complaints is that adults are either actively neglectful or antagonistic to the hero children. If an adult is supportive of them, they are generally powerless characters or characters that are publicly labelled as 'bad' people like Hagrid or Sirius. Again, this is nothing new. Think about&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Wonderful-Wizard-of-Oz-100th-Anniversary-Edition-Books-of-Wonder/dp/0060293233/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: 100th Anniversary Edition (Books of Wonder)</a>. The same thing happens there.<br /><br />Regardless, the series is a LOT of fun. I've read each one straight through like most everyone else on here. I've been to every movie. I've even gotten supplemental books. I think it's a great story for any age reader. I love the fact that it addresses lots of issues that most 'children's books' tend to avoid, like death and Harry's relationship with his guardians. I think these could easily be used to help bring up all sorts of great conversations with children above and beyond discussions of Harry and Hogwarts.<br /><br />Now, this book. I was sad to see the series end, but really respect the fact that Rowling had a vision for 7 years of school and 7 books...and stuck with it. Maybe future books may come out, but it doesn't look like it. That's really great of her for not compromising for a buck. Everything pretty much gets tied up in this final novel, but that's really my only problem with it. Everything gets tied up. In order to do that, some things ended up feeling a little forced. I'm glad we didn't get left wondering "but what about..." but some of the resolutions left me feeling a bit unsatisfied. Still, there's lots of action, plenty of adventure, and will thrill anyone who's been following Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
