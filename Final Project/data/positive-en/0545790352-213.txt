Just beautiful! Can't wait to introduce my son to the Harry Potter world through this illustrated version! Larger in size than even the hardback version, so just know this is more of a lap book. It measures about 9&#34;x11&#34; and is also heavier due to the quality and thickness of the pages. Each page is smooth semi gloss in full color, like a nice children's picture book. Just so much nicer than I imagined for then price!
