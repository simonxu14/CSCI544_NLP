Again, why are you reading this review?  You either love or loathe Harry Potter.  You're either going to read the entire series or none of the books at all.  I think all of the books are absolutely GREAT!<br /><br />In any case, Order of the Phoenix (OOTP) is the 5th book in the series.  In this book Harry becomes more involved in the battle against Voldemort while fending off the non-supportive Ministry of Magic.  I thought it was a little long and drawn out, but JK Rowling has said that everything in this book was there for a reason--there were certain things we had to see in this book for later books.  (I read that somewhere--I don't have a source to quote though).  Harry learns of his true destiny in this book.  If you wanna know, you gotta buy it!  (Like you're not going to anyway!)
