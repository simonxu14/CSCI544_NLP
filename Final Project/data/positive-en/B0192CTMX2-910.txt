I'm not a Harry Potter fan, generally, but I read the last two books out of curiosity (my wife took me to the first 5 movies so I had a basic grasp of the plot). I thought HPatDH was surprisingly well-written (I started reading the first book when it came out but it was too much of a children's book for my taste). The story was much darker and more "adult" than I would have expected; Rowling's craft has defiantly improved dramatically.<br /><br />The only negative points were: the plot seemed to stutter at points; the resolution of these problems seemed contrived at times. Also, I found the ending slightly anti-climatic but, with such a huge build-up, I'm not sure that was avoidable.<br /><br />Overall, HPatDP is a really good book and a satisfying conclusion to the series.<br /><br />Recommended.
