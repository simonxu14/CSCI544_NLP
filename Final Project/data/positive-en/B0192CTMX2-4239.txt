I loved this book. It is easily the best book in the series. I have to admire JK Rowling for her ability to kill off major characters when she has to be more attached to them than we are. The only reason it doesn't make 5 stars is because Rowling decided to tack on a horrible epilogue that doesn't answer any questions about Harry's future (plus the fact that she had to reveal things on her website that didn't factor into the books at all....)
