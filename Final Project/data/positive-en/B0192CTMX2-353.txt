Finally, we know it all...all the answers you have been waiting for since the very first book. This one grabs you from the first page, and doesn't let you put it down. Now you know what really happened with Dumbledore, and Snape, and all the other people you really wondered about. Ms. Rowling did herself proud with this one. Up until this point, I had loved the 4th book for it's fullness and revelations, but the 7th book ends things the way we always thought they ought to, with the exception of some people dying...but we already knew that was coming. Suffice it to say, I laughed, I cried, I LOVED THIS BOOK! It's all we wanted it to be!
