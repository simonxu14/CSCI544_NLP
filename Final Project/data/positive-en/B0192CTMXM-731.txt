I know that most people would say because it is the last book it is the best.  But, this is not the case with this story.  This is the best book because I believe there were a lot more feeling and character growth and development in this story.  I wont give away anything about the story or the future of Harry Potter.  This book (verses all of the previous stories), you are watching as young adults are trudging their way into adulthood.  There isn't any teenage annexed or teen pressure.  This story is said to be "slow" at the beginning, mostly because there isn't any "action".  I would whole-heartedly disagree with this assessment.  The first half of the book is the character development that I was hoping for.<br /><br />Loads of people write reviews of the Potter stories.  Everyone has their likes and dislikes for the stories and characters.  J.K. Rowling has done her best work with this story.  She has brought all of the previous questions; plot twists and characters back for one final party.  There is no way you could read this book first or without the others, but once you get to it - I'm sure it will be your favorite.
