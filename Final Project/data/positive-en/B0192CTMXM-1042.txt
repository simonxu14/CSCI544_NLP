What a great book!  I really enjoyed how everything came full circle.  Of course there are things that I think I would have written differently but then again I am not the author and she wrote this book for all of our enjoyment!  It was a little slow in the middle but that was part of the character development and no reason to ding my rating.<br />This was the first book that made me cry and gave me a newfound respect for a few characters that we know and may or may not love.<br />I am so sad it is over but now I can share these with my kids as they grow up.
