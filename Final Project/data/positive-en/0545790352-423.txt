I love this book!!!!!  I already have more than one book of the Sorcerer's Stone, but could not wait to get this one and was not disappointed.  The illustrations are breathtaking.  Jim Kay has perfectly captured the essence and magic of this story. I also loved the larger size of the book.  Had thought to just place it along side my other copies, but ended up reading the story and living the magic again  Can't wait for Chamber Of Secrets to be released with Jim Kay illustrations to bring it to life once again!!
