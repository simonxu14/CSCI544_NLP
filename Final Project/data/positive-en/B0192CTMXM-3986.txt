Harry Potter evokes feelings in me that other books can't quite reach. At the end of every book, it is so hard to come out of the world that she created and move on with everyday life, wondering what will happen next to Harry and his friends.<br /><br />So it was with great trepidation that I picked up this final volume. Would she end it horribly? Would it be too sappy or too violent? How could she possibly tie everything up satisfyingly?<br /><br />Well, she succeeded. While this book is far too scary and violent for younger readers (I cried through half of it and found my heart racing through much of it), she hit the right balances for me in wrapping things up. The ending didn't feel contrived or fake, there was heartbreak and joy throughout the book, and we got to see all our old favorite characters and watch them come together in flesh and in spirit to fight for goodness and all that is right in the world.<br /><br />I'd think that books 5-7 would be too hard for kids younger than 12 to take, though. If you are planning on letting children or young teens read these final books, you might read along with them and be sure you can discuss the scary parts with them. This book is done well enough that it brings up a lot of philosophical thoughts about our world today and things that have happened in our history, and it would help younger readers to be able to talk about it all with a grownup who can help explain, support, or put it into context.<br /><br />Overall, I really couldn't have hoped for a better ending to such a beloved series. Thank you, JK Rowling.
