J.K. Rowling has done it again... she is amazing!  The fifth installment in the Harry Potter series has kept the fire lit in my heart for these books.  No matter how young (or young at heart) you are, you will love these books.  The characters in The Order of the Phoenix have really grown -- and Rowling somehow knew just how to do it.  Rowling has been my favorite author for six months now (recieved books 1-4 Christmas 2002) and I ordered book 5 in January (of course from Amazon.com)  You can never say enough about Harry Potter and J.K. Rowling.  Amazing, Fantastic, Genius and downright Magical!
