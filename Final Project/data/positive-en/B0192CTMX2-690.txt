I have just finished listening to "Deathly Hallows" and I am still numb. Jim Dale's narration is gripping and thrilling. I was hanging onto every word that came out of his mouth. He is brilliant in capturing characters verbally; even when our heroes take the polyjuice potion and are different people, he gives them new voices but still retains the essence of them. The pacing is first rate and his ability to portray verbally a wide swath of emotions of seemingly hundreds of characters is amazing.<br /><br />I have listened to all the Harry Potter books, which are narrated by Dale, and find this is the best way to encounter Rowling's series. When I've read some of the books, I always thought she needed an editor because the books seemed bloated. However, when listening to the books, Dale makes every word count, which then makes all the books a coherent whole.<br /><br />Dale deserved the Best Narration award from Audiophile for his narration of the "Order of the Phoenix." I know he'll get another for this book.<br /><br />I think he would be a great narrator for another audio version of the Lord of the Rings series. Ron Inglis' version, which is very good, is from the early 90s. It's time for a new one and Jim Dale would be the perfect voice for it.
