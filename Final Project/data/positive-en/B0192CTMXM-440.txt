Book 5 met all of my expectations and then exeeded them.  J.K Rowling dug deeper into every charachter and made me love them even more.  Order of the Pheonix was also the most revealing book so far, but still left plenty to be uncovered in the next two books, which hopefully will be just as long, or possibly even longer.  Fans will not be dissapointed.
