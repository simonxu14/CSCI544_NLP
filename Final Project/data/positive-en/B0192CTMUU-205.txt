What has truly astounded me about this series is that, as the characters mature, so do the plots.  With this book, our heroes start to turn into teenagers, complete with moodiness, puppy love, and concern about what their peers actually think of them.  Likewise, their awareness of the world  around them continues to increase, and what appeared to be a simple,  childish world of magic in the first book becomes a more sophisticated,  intriguing place.  I hope that this style of story telling will continue  with the next three books- I think it is an excellent way to develop a  series covering several years from a character's life, and will appeal to  younger readers, who are growing up even as the characters are.  I'm sure  the backlash is already rising against this book, just because it has  already been so successful.  Ignore that.  Read it.  Then tell all the  Muggles to jump in a lake.
