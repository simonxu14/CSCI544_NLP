JK must be given credit where credit is due.  From Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows we have seen this young wizard grow up and mature in a world that is changing as quickly as he is.<br /><br />While the last installment is dark, the themes of death, war and loss are treated with respect and unbias.  JK has masterfully woven these ideas into her novel without them being dominant.  No one thought Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was going to be all rainbows and butterflies did they?  I certainly hope not.  Poor reviews that are due to the somewhat dark nature of this book seem misguided and even immature.  Readers were prepared for what was to come.<br /><br />While I must say that JK Rowling and her fans hyped certain aspects of this book out of proportion, on the whole it did live up to expectations.  After JK dropping so many tantalizing teasers who can blame excited fans for becoming a bit overzealous?  In some regards, minor characters who had built up a lot of momentum did not live up to the image that JK and fans had made for them.  However, other aspects of the book were fresh and packed with surprises.<br /><br />Most loose ends were tied up and some ends we didn't even think were loose were tightened and rewoven back into the plot.  A wonderful surprise for even the most die hard fan when their eyes light up and they realize "I never even thought of that!".  The bits about Crookshanks were among my favorites.  Who knew!  And Dumbledore fans will find themselves with heaps of new information to ponder about their favorite headmaster.  And what of Snape?  Well, some of us fans knew it all along...<br /><br />My two complaints are small ones.  First off, the final chapter seemed empty and even childish.  The childish nature is forgivable given the setting and situation but the writing seemed sloppy and something of an afterthought.  I know JK has said that she wrote the final chapter while working on The Sorcerers Stone and if this truly is the case, I think she could have done to modernize it a bit.  Secondly, there are parts in the book that are slow and do drag a bit, namely when the trio spends a bit of time in the Forest of Dean.  Harry, Hermione and Ron may feel rather pointless and lost at this point in the novel but unfortunately, so does the reader!  The pace picks up about two thirds through and doesn't ebb again.<br /><br />All in all, a wonderful and sound summation for this series.  I am just so sad to see it end...
