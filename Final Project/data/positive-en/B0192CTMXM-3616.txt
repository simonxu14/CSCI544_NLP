If you're the emotional type the first 80 pages will have you tears, there is death, not all of it human, but you feel the genuine danger, frustration and hopelessness that the characters feel.<br /><br />Then the books slows to a dead crawl. Rowling separates Harry, Hermoine and Ron (leaving Ginny out of 99% of the book) after an attack at the Weasley's. This seems to trigger a sort of quest sage for the young wizards to find the horcrux's, but alas, no. They stumble around boringly for the first third of the book, arguing and snipping, falling into traps and barely doing anything other than being foolish and getting on each others (and our) nerves.<br /><br />Reading the books you'll notice that a battle between Harry and Ron / Ron and Hermoine is at the center of every book. This is partially because Ron and Hermoine are in love and to annoying to admit it to each other, partially because Ron is jealous of Harry -- although wasn't he supposed to have gotten over that in book 4? No. Oh well. In this case the kids take turns wearing a horcrux that they don't have the means to destroy, but it, in turn, makes the wearer mean and paranoid.<br /><br />When the three finally unite in peace and set out to work the book finally finds it's pacing and we're off!<br /><br />Rowling digs deep into Orwellian territory here as Voltamort and his Death Eaters set out to control the ministry and with the help of one Umbridge of the pink persuasion, set the stage for what could become a Mudblood holocaust. Ever vigilant harry has a rare moment as a powerful wizard when he stages a off-the-cuff breakout for those accused of being muggle-born.<br /><br />When the book picks up its ground it's following a daring escape and a death that finally knocks Harry into movement. But there's some deep, dark secrets to find out first. Mostly that Dumbledore isn't the saint Harry thought, nor is he the evil Rita Skeeter makes him out to be, turns out, he's just as flawed as everyone.<br /><br />The revelation fans have been waiting for, Snapes true story, is at the end of the book, just before the final confrontation with Voltemort. If you've been reading carefully, especially the end of Half Blood Prince, and make note of the very, very careful dialogue Snape uses you can guess where this is going, although some things about Snapss childhood are revealed you couldn't guess.<br /><br />The finally is well, final.<br /><br />Don't hope for an epic duel between the Dark Lord and Harry, it does come. As usual, it's not about power or skill, it's about who Harry is and how badly Votamort has screwed up.<br /><br />Over all Rowling ties things up in another true page turner, including a "19 years later" epilogue where you learn the names of all the kids they are going to have. Another "after volty" chapter however would have been nice to tie up the present. After a moment with Dudly in the beginning of the book, you might miss that there's nothing else about the Durselys at the end. There's no doubt about it, this is not Lord of the Rings, there's no 180 page journey back after the finale, however 20 or so pages dealing with the repercussions of the final battle would have been more satisfying. After seven books, fans deserved a little more at the end.
