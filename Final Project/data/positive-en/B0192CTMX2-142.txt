What is there to say that hasn't already been said?  J.K. Rowling has created a masterful series with the 'Harry Potter' saga, and has given it a glorious and befitting ending.  The very first wonder and amazement that took hold of readers when they read the first book has continued throughout; the world that Rowling created was just as important as the characters who populated it, as all the stories and details come full circle in the end.<br /><br />At the end of the sixth book, many were left wondering how everything would be resolved in book seven.  Was Severus Snape, the man who just killed the beloved Albus Dumbledore, the pure villain Harry believed him to be, or was it just possible that there was more to his story?  As the seventh story unfolds, Harry, Ron, and Hermione hunt for the horcruxes that are the key to Voldemort's downfall, while the Dark Lord is busy taking over, in an all too real and reminiscent way.  The wizarding world is at war, and anyone who is bold enough to stand against Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters must pay with their life.<br /><br />It should go without saying, but this is a fitting end to Harry's story, and perhaps the best one in the series.  While the story sags a little in the middle under the weight of Harry's frustration, it begins and ends with a bang that keeps readers hooked.  In the other books, the necessary deaths were shocking and difficult to read; the sheer number and frequency of the necessary deaths in "Deathly Hallows" is just as shocking and perhaps even more numbing.  What a marvelous world that Rowling has created for us muggles to visit again and again, even if we know how things will work out in the end.
