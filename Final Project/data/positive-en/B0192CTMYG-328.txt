I have been hugely impressed with all four HP books, so I bought the audiocassette to see whether I could get my husband hooked. We listened to  the first half on a long car trip, and I think it worked.  Jim Dale does a  wonderful job of reading, differentiating each character in a different,  and very characteristic, voice. (Apparently he's had to use 400+ voices for  HPIV!)<br />I was surprised to find how much I gleaned from Dale's reading  even after reading Sorceror's Stone several times. The slower pace and  different emphases of reading aloud highlight points that are easy to miss  in a silent reading. Also, hearing the Scots burr of Prof. McGonagall and  Hagrid's regional accent (Lancaster? Somerset?) serve to bring out aspects  of their characters that were less apparent to this American reader.
