I have read the Harry Potter series five times, and now starting into my sixth with this illustrated version. Jim Kay has done such a wonderful job with these pictures, they have brought to life characters and landscapes the movie and my own imagination could not have created. I have pre-orded the second one and will be a proud owner of the set when it is finished. Thank you Jim Kay and J.K. Rowling for bringing Harry Potter to life in a whole new way.
