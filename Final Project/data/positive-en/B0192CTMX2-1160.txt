She's done it again. This was one of the best books in the series. An excellent follow up and more child friendly than some (older child anyway). This book did an excellent job of tying up all the loose ends, giving answers to all the unanaswered questions, and having a generally satisfactory conclusion to a huge story. A must read for any fan and not a book to be feared as some of the hype might have led you to believe.
