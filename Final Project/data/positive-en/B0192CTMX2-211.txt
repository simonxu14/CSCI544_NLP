I finished Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows on Thursday after the book was released. The only reason it took so long was that I was re-reading Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. There were many things that I had forgotten. I was so disappointed when I read the last page. This was a real barn burner and I wanted more. One thing for sure, J.K. Rowling did not disappoint. The only thing she did was leave us wanting more Harry Potter. Kudos for such a wonderful work. I am a grandmother and I have enjoyed being able to discuss these books with my daughter and my grandchildren. Please give us more!
