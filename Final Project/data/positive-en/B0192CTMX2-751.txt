Full of Dark overtones, I was highly satisfied with all 870 pages of Harry's 5th year at Hogwarts.  For naysayers who were disappointed with Harry's moodiness, angst or hormones - it's simply "real".  In this volume, Harry Potter is amazingly human.  He's 15!  Find me a fifteen- year-old who is not moody or conflicted with their feelings on a daily basis.  From the moment I began reading I knew that a new mood was being constructed, beginning as a shift in tone in the 4th novel, but now comes to the forefront.  Will the last 2 be as dark I wondered?  Maybe, maybe not...  BUT, Is it worth it?  DEFINITELY...  There is so much dimension and depth added to Harry that you can nearly reach out and touch him.  He appears this time as the hero, but a hero with scars, burdens and pain.  Harry is a true hero, but, a hero filled with all kinds of desires that blur the lines between good, evil and a nasty self-fulfilling prophecy.  J.K. Rowling - I'll wait 10 years if need be for the next volume, as long as you make it as amazing as this one.  I can't wait to hop on the next Hogwarts Express...
