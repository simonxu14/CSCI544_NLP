I wasn't going to review this because, well, why bother? Everybody in the world is going to read this and every other Harry Potter book Rowling writes regardless of what I have to say about it, but after reading another review, I thought I'd kick in my two cents.<br />I agreed with some of what the reviewer pointed out: once the "failthful death-eater" had gotten close to Harry (almost immediately after his arrival at Hogworts), why bother with the Triwizard Tournament. The winning cup didn't have to be a portkey. Any book, homework assignment, any object could have been made into a portkey and handed to Harry at any time.<br />On top of that, aside from the first challenge (against the dragon), the challenges were kind of a waste. They had bleachers up around the lake, but clearly people couldn't see what happened while the champions were in the water, so what exactly did they watch? The same is true of the maze. If anyone could see what was going on in the maze, then Moody couldn't have been taking care of Harry through the hedges, so again, what did the people in the stands watch - a bunch of hedges growing?<br />I disagreed with some of the complaints about subplots. Certainly some of them could have been eliminated, but I enjoy the subplots. My interest is not only in Harry. One of the biggest lacks in the movies is the lack of the supporting cast: the Weasley twins, Neville, etc.<br />Also, to be frank, as far as logic and suspension of disbelief are concerned, this book falls a bit short of the others, but it was every bit as engaging, the characters were every bit as enjoyable. This has come to be my second favorite book of the series, with "Prisoner of Azkaban" taking the top honor.<br />Anyway, happy reading and warm breezes to everyone.
