Who’d have thought that two warring neighbors in an upscale neighborhood (Malibu, CA) could escalate their squabbles to an epic level?  I spent a lot of time wondering &#34;Blimey, could this work in everyday life?&#34;<br /><br />Hey folks, here’s my tuppenceworth.  Two memorable characters:  One good, a sophisticated lawyer, but still a “babe in the woods” compared to the other, a crafty son-of-a-gun, more cunning than the Horned One himself, and this bloke, well, he wears his charisma thick on his sleeve.  So I’m thinking, have we finally entered the age of the thinking thriller?  If one discounts the purple prose pouring unctuously from Machiavelli’s lips (which incidentally fits this impostor’s persona to a T), it’s a bloody brilliant novel—a novel exploiting a novel concept!  The plot builds momentum like an opus.  If you must know, by the time it reached its crescendo  towards chapter 35 or so, I was on my feet cheering, ready with a standing ovation and a bottle of Michelob in my right hand—cf. last chapter.  All right, I’m a bit of a cat lover, too, but still!<br /><br />I’ve got to warn you, though, or you'll find yourself sneaking moments out of your busy day to decrypt the meaning of life using Machiavelli’s clever word acrobatics, which goes by a fancy French name for voodoo-something-or-other, but is nonetheless an eminently patentable formula if you ask me!  In fact, I think I've just glimpsed the writing on the wall, and if I’m not deluded it reads: CHASE’S BOOK GARNERS PLAUDITS ON GLOBAL SCALE!<br /><br />For a jaded bloke like myself, reading Know Thy Neighbor was like a breath of high octane oxygen after spending hours in a cigar smoke-filled room.<br /><br />Incorrigible Book Lover Paul Gardner
