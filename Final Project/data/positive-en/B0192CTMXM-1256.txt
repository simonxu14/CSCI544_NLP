This is an excellent book.  What made it even better is Jim Dale's fantastic narration.  As with the other books, the characters come alive and take on distinct personalities due to Mr. Dale's rendering of their unique voices.  It's a shame that this is the end of the 7 book series. I highly recommend listening to this and the other HP audio books!
