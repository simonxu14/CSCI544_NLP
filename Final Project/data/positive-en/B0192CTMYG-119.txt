Have seen the movies, but had not read any of the books.  All of my adult friends have raved about the books.  I don't have a lot of time for reading, so I bought the audio version to listen to in the car.  Got through this first book while driving up to Maine and back.  Glad I bought it.  Knowing the full story brought additional understanding to some of the things in the movie and the individual doing the reading was very pleasant to listen to.
