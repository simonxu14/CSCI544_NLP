The illustrations in this book are absolutely stunning.  I've been a big fan of Harry Potter since the first time I read it in 4th grade so I had high hopes for this book.  It certainly did not disappoint.  The level of detail that Jim Kay gives to the illustrations is breathtaking.  This would make a perfect gift for anyone that loves the world of Harry Potter.
