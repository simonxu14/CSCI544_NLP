Long awaited and maybe that was part of the problem, no book could have lived up to the hopes and dreams of waiting for 2 plus years. It was an easy read for a book of such girth and I did enjoy the fact that we learned more about the magical world like the ministry,The Black family tree and Harry's background. I not only read the hard cover but also listened to the audio and I could never give Jim Dale enough praise. He does an excellent job - makes you feel like instead of one person reading that an entire cast is in the room. I will of course be awaiting entry number 6 but I hope the wait is quite as long.
