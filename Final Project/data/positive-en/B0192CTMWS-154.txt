To get the full experience of the book I read it while listening to the Audio book.  I had ripped the CD set to my iPOD since I no longer own a portable CD player.  I found something interesting, certain sections of the book is missing.  When I play the CD on a CD player, the section is there.  I guess this is some form of Digital Rights Management.  Keep this in mind.  It is too bad that other audio book formats are not supported.<br /><br />The book is the best one JK Rowling has written, I cried and laughed.  Jim Dale does a great job capturing the characters.
