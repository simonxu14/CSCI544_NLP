I LOVE THIS BOOK -- not as much as 1 & 2, but it endeared itself to me, right from the beginning, when Rowling's lovable humour came back into my life  :):)  I luv her ~ she's my new hero.  So outlandishly, unapologetically creative,  and with enough 'edge' to keep you curious about what can POSSIBLY happen next to Harry & his adorable tribe of Wizards.<br />Thank you, JK Rowling, for offering me a new world to escape into. . .  over . . . & over . . . & over . . .<br /><br />(right after i finished it, ran out & got the Goblet & started -- I'm not even done watching the movie for this one!)
