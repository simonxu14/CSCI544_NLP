I've just read this book for the 2nd time realizing how much I had forgotten.  The movie follows this book closely but the book is always better.  This book like the first starts off pulling you in the minute the Weasley's break him out.  I enjoyed the suspense/mystery of this book as to who is the heir of Slyterin.  Time doesn't feel rushed in the book as it did in the movie.  I loved this book and read it quickly, a real page turner.  I will read this book again.  It's excellent for kids and adults.
