Harry Potter, I got this book as a Christmas present opened it up and kept my nose in it non-stop. An exelent book with plenty of imagination. It is full of exictement and a very good plot. I think J.K. Rowling should be and  will be remembered along with many other great authors. I recomend thios  book for anyone not just for 9-12 year olds but anyone. If you need a book  get Harry Potter.
