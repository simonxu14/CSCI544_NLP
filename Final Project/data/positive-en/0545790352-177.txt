The illustrations were beautiful and the book is just gorgeous. The only thing I was disappointed about was the paucity of Hermione illustrations. She has one portrait and is is two group pictures and she doesn't even show up until late in the book. Ron has a portrait at the part where he meets Harry and is the subject of many drawings after but Hermione doesn't show up in illustration until page 151 after the episode of the mountain troll (she is not in that picture either). But wow! The illustrations are amazing.
