J.K. Rowling certainly doesn't disappoint with this third Harry Potter book. It has everything I look for in a book: a wonderful story, terrific writing, imagination, and drama. Rowling tells the story in an amazing way  without blood, gore, or violence. It makes me wish that Hogwarts was real,  but the author writes so well that you can almost feel that it is real,  even if it is only while you are reading. I can hardly wait to share this  with all the students at our elementary school library, but I'm a 42 yr.  old woman, so please don't hesitate to read this book no matter what your  age!
