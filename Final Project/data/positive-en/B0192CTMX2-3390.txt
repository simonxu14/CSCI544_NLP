I just have to say that its an EXCELLENTE book, i wouldnt go as far as saying its the best, i have to reread it, but is intense, amazing, fun, and a great conclusion to a great series, im sorry for al the characters that have to die  but glad for the ones who survived. Most of the plot points were solved, and let me say this is going to make one hell of a movie.....
