This stunningly illustrated edition is the perfect way to introduce and engage younger children to the Harry Potter series. The text is the original and is unabridged, so one can still immerse young children in the richer language and storytelling, while the beautiful illustrations hold their attention. I went through this book with my 6 year old son, but we easily could have tackled this book at a younger age for him. Although he's ready for the original unillustrated editions, I will continue to purchase the illustrated copies as they're released, for our enjoyment, and for my 3 year old.
