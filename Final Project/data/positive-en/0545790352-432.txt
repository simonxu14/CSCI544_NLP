What could go wrong with a Harry Potter illustrated book? Absolutely nothing! This is amazing and such a piece to be held in a collection that is so dear to my heart. I can't wait for the rest of them to come down. I will be ordering a second set so that my son can grow up reading Harry Potter with the magical pictures we all once dreamed up in our imaginations. It helped me see things in ways different than the movies. I could lay around and look at the pictures all day.
