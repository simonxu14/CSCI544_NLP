While not as emotionally gripping as the Goblet of Fire with its personal high stakes (the fantastic Tri-Wizard tournament and the Dark Lord's personal attack on Harry Potter),<br />Order of the Phoenix is a masterfully plotted read that succeeds on many fronts - it is a tale of Harry Potter growing up and as such it is full of frustration, emotion, and the reality of constantly changing relationships in an ever increasingly dangerous world.<br />Without revealing any specific spoilers for readers who have not finished the story, the Order of the Phoenix starts off with a bang (or is it crack) and the events on Privet Drive soon leads Harry back to his fifth year at Hogwarts, with his enemies on more fronts than  before.  Harry's future career will be decided by his results of his OWLs (ordinary wizarding level exams), the new Defense Against Dark Arts professor will prove to be far more challenging than her girlish voice, the Ministry of Magic will prove be a political force to be reckoned with, Professor Snape will be as daunting as ever, You Know Who conjures darkness and death with his Death Eaters, and yes, raging hormones and romance will play a part (could it be someone from RavenClaw ?).<br />The whole cast is back, from Lupin to Rita Skeeter to the Weasley twins, more mischievous and entertaining than ever.  And the good thing is, we learn many things about those around Harry, from the Dursleys to the Weasleys to even Professor Snape and we begin to really really understand what Harry has faced and what he is going to have to face in the upcoming two novels.  Growing up is never easy for anyone and Harry is definitely not going to have anything easy at 15 - not even Quidditch.  Harry is very angry in this book, like many teenagers caught in the awkward stage between child and adult yet possessed of certain powers beyond their years.  It is a stage where things change moment by moment, where there are stresses beyond belief, where there are awkward moments when one is neither adult nor child - and it is here that JK Rowling captures Harry's essence perfectly - Harry's confused adolescence and the continued evolving relationships of his friends, peers, and loved ones.<br />Order of the Phoenix sets a marvelous stage for what's to come - it gives the reader the background and emotions to understand the harsh reality that is about to come into the wizarding world - that Lord Voldermort will bring much pain and suffering and that Harry must fulfill his destiny whether he wants to or not.  The dark tone from Goblet of Fire continues in this book but it is contrasted by the wild clever imagination of JK Rowling and her wonderful gift for making interesting new out of old - new spells, new magical creatures, new revelations, even new areas of the magical world such as the Ministry of Magic (love the location) or St. Mungo - hospital for magical maladies and injuries.<br />I enjoyed the book immensely and heartily recommend this to all Harry Potter fans (and even to the minute Muggle minority that hasn't read the series).  Author JK Rowling provides a lot of great character background here and one can see the beginnings of plot lines and twists for Harry's final two years at Hogwarts.  Harry is changing, Hogwarts is changing, and even the Sorting Hat can sense the darkest time ahead - its a call for unity and I for one, cannot wait to see what happens next - I'm with you Harry and JK, even if I have to spend the summer with the Dursleys again.  But in the meantime, I'm going to pop a butterbeer and read this still too short book again !
