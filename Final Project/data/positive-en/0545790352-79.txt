What can one say? A fantastic book with amazing illustrations and a nice sewn-in satin ribbon bookmark. After reading all of the US novels, I loved reading this British version. If you are reading this series with smaller children, this edition is a great way to get started. The illustrations will be great conversation starters. I will definitely be buying the entire series in these fully illustrated editions.
