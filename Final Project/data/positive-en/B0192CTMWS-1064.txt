Some sequels are never quite as good as the originals.  This series of books, however, gets better and better.  During his third year at Hogwarts,  Harry must deal with the fact that an escaped prisoner is out to get him.  Will Harry be safe within the walls of Hogwarts? This book was an  entertaining read and kept me on the edge of my seat, even as an adult  reading it (you'll hear the same thing from the kids).  Believe me when I  say that we are all awaiting Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts School of  Witchcraft and Wizardry.
