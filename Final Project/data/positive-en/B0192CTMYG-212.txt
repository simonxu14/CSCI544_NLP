The description of this product is describing a first printing of the American edition, I think. The British edition has no illustrations or harlequin end pages, which the american addition does, and the product is not a first printing. It looks nice, and if you're a massive HP nerd then you can appreciate this purchase, but it was not as the description advertised.
