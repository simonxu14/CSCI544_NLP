I am fortunate that my parents taught me to love reading.  The Harry Potter series, while intended for children, had me so enraptured over the past week that I wish I was 11 again, just so I could talk to my friends  about it.  I was, and am, enchanted by the ordinary things made  extraordinary in this series and have found myself peering into the sky,  looking for my owl mail. If your kids like Harry Potter, try also Roald  Dahl, Madeline L'Engle and John Bellairs
