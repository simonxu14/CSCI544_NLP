If you are a Harry Potter fan you don't need my review; if you haven't read them ...START, and go through the series ending with the Deathly Hallows.  All your questions will be answered, all your doubts resolved, all your fears allayed.  The only question you will be left with is: Why end the series here?  I want MORE!!!
