I've always been an HP fan. Read the Philosophers Stone first time it came out almost ten years ago. The first was definitely magically, it really triggered my imagination. And then came the second, third, even the fourth books still held its magic. Unfortunately, as is the problem with most successful authors, in trying to capture and hold on to the success of the previous ones, they start rambling on and on about something so unmemorable. Don't get me wrong, this last and final book is impressive, given the enormous amount of pressure she was in, she still succeeded in delivering excellent work. The storyline is great, narrative wonderfully entertaining but the middle part of the book sounded more like JK Rowling trapped in a castle, not knowing what to do. And we the readers are trapped alongside with her inside her head. It sounded more like a personal diary of a bewildered celebrity. Whinning about, oh, the pressure of not being able to please anyone!!! The sense of despair, helplessness and feeling of being way in over our heads kept drumming into my skull. Many times I found myself saying, please enough already we get it! The story could have been done shorter, more fast paced and action packed like the first few books. I have this nagging feeling that in the first couple of books of the series, she was writing Harry. Now, with a billion dollars worth of pressure, she was writing herself in Harry. Oh well, still a good read. Unlike the first, I just won't read the whole thing over and over again.<br />I can't wait until she writes another book. I am sure it would be just like the first Harry.
