I cannot say enough about this series.  I am 50 years old, have always been extremely into children's literature- most of the children in my life receive classics from me for birthdays and holidays.  The Harry Potter series is one of the best I have read.  Each book is special in its own way and each allows us to know the characters a little better.<br /><br />Every parent should be reading through this series with their pre-teens and teens.  They are an absolute delight that every child should experience!  Wonderful!!!
