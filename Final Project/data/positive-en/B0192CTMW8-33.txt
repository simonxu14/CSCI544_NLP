The second installment of the Harry Potter series is well worth your time. PLEASE read the first book first, so that the story will make much more sense (and come on Harry Potter is such a defining series of the past 15 years), however JK did a great job of making this book have all necessary information if you decide to skip it.  I say, NO VIOLENCE, because I do not think it is anything graphic, and I have had no problem reading it as a child or an adult, but do know that Harry must fight against He-who-must-not-be-named, throughout the series. Contains themes great for children or adults-friendship, being yourself, good vs. evil, etc. Wonderful Story line, and really sets up for the &#34;darker&#34; events of the end of the series. I love this series!
