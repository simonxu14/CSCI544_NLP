I enjoyed the book on CD a great deal.  I had seen the movies but suspected that the books had a lot more to them.  I was right.  Normally I listen to the books then see the movies.  Not in this case.  I truly enjoyed this.  The used CD's played like new and I am sure I will enjoy them again and again.
