More brilliant, albeit simple, writing from Rowling.  By simple meaning it's not pretentiously overwritten like many of the books that NPR likes to highlight, but not simple like a meaningless romance novel or other such  trite entertainment.  Although I am an adult, I love these books, and can  read them over and over, especially this one, which is very true to the  style formed in the first book, but also different in that the plot writing  is not stuck in a formulaic system like some book series can get into,  especially many children's books series. If I were a small child, this is  absolutely what I would be looking for, and what I did look for as a child  - I read Asimov's Three Adventurers, Encyclopedia Brown, and other  challenging, brain-based children's fiction that also have the great  adventure and children-getting-the-upper-hand-over-the-adults scenarios  that can make a child feel less helpless, and give one some hope.  Harry  Potter has all that, and has a lot of it.  I can't recommend the series  enough, for adults and for youth.  I am so happy that for once a super  popular book is actually something that is well-written and not an insult  to the intelligence and one's aesthetic sensability - I am so amazed at  this, because so few people seem to ever exhibit any intelligence or  aesthetic sensibility, that the cynic in me would assume that this series  would have failed on the first book for being not-stupid-enough for the  mass audience.  Thank God something clicked in people's heads that they are  willing to explore and challenge themselves a little bit more beyond  insipid love stories and pointless and poorly written action/adventure  books.<br />Three cheers for Harry Potter!
