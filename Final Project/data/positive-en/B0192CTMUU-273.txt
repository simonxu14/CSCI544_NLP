This is a pivotal book in the Harry Potter series. The story-line is impressive and the characters wondeful. As usual, the true villain, besides  You-Know-Who, is a complete surprise. Hermione's character is growing up in  this book and we can expect plenty more from her in the future.  Yes, there  is a death in the book but it did not come as a big surprise as to who  would die. The topic itself is dealt with grace and sensitivity. I would  not fear allowing my kids to read it.<br />Looking forward to the next book in  the series already.
