I bought this to read to my (yet to be born) son so I can share the magic that shaped my childhood with him and I am so pleased with it. The print is large and the illustrations are phenomenal! I cannot wait to immerse my son in a world of magic! So thrilled to see how the rest of these turn out so he can have the entire collection!
