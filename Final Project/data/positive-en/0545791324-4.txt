The Chamber of Secrets is the second illustrated book to be released.  Just like the first, the text is not written the same as the US released version but, it is nothing short of amazing.  I love that this is the FULL book and not a shortened or altered version.<br /><br />The detail and precision in this book is unmatched (I didn't think it could get any better after the first book came out but they did.)<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone looking to read or reread the books. We use these to read to our kiddos and the pictures keep their attention while still getting the full story.<br />If you found this review to be helpful, please click the helpful button below! :)
