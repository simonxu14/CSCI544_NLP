...I found myself distressed as I read of Harrys angst through the initial chapters.  As I continued, however, I started to remember my own troubled experience of being 15.  J.K. Rowling absolutely NAILS this difficult stage of growing up.  My affinity for Harry deepened as I accelerated my reading through the chapters.<br />Great fiction is defined, in my mind, as a set of charcters struggling with timeless themes that are universal in their appeal to us all.  I held my breath as I re-lived my first kiss, my resentment of my paternal figures and the awkwardness of being 15.  If anything, Harry came more alive to me in his confusion, anger and angst in this 5th chapter of the series.<br />I can't immagine the pressure, as a writer, to constantly surpass the expectation of a series so widely heralded as the Harry Potter series.  Yet, Ms. Rowling seems not only to have met but exceeded her previous marks.<br />As an appreciative reader - my heartiest Thank You! for creating and sustaning this serial adventure.
