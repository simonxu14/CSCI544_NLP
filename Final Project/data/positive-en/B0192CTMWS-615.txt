What can I say about the last book in what has been for me and my family a magical and wonderful journey?  The only thing is simply "WOW".  I had very mixed emotions when I held the last book in my hands.  Happiness that I would finally find out all of the answers, and extreme sadness that this would be the last time I would anticipate what was in store for these charachters that had become very dear and familiar.  JK Rowling has taken us to the final chapter of a great series and did it wonderfully.  I was one of the millions of fans who waited at a store at midnight.  I had already ordered my book on Amazon in February, but I wanted my children to witness the phenomenon of people waiting for a book as though it was a major rock concert.  We even bought an additional copy because my daughter did not want to wait for me to finish.  Although I finished by noon the next day.  Although I loved this book and the CD read beautifully by Jim Dale.  I thought a few of the chapters were a little drawn out, but the final 3 chapters I was reading through my tears.  I had to re-read them to catch what I had missed.  I will not give away any details, since I would not want to spoil it for anyone who has not read it yet.  All I can say is I was very happy with The Deathly Hallows, and am going back and re-reading from the begining.  I hope that future generations enjoy this series as much as we have.  JK Rowling has given us a new classic for everyone to enjoy.
