OK. I admit to being a little behind the times.  Although I had purchased all the Harry Potter books for my 10-year-old grandson, I hadn't had the  chance to read them.  Since my 80-year-old Mom wanted to read the books  too, we decided to listen to the unabridged version during a recent trip to  the Dakotas.  We were both mesmerized!  Jim Dale is a terrific narrator for  the tapes, doing the different characters' voices so well you could hardly  believe it was the same person doing all of them!  From the Scottish accent  of Mrs. McGonnigle to the Irish accent of the Centaurs to the Cockney  accent of one major characters, all are so vivid!  What a magical story!  Mom and I both remarked several times on what an amazing imagination J.K.  Rowling possesses to dream up such a tale.  We also remarked on how we  understood why Harry Potter has captured the attention and imagination of  so many youngsters of every age.  I can't recommend this one highly enough!
