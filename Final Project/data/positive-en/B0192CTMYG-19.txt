I studied Spanish in college many (I mean many) years ago and have been trying to relearn the language.  I remember the basic grammar but my vocabulary is pretty weak.  I decide to read Spanish books geared for young adults and found the entire Harry Potter series (I made it through the first 4 so far) to be truly enjoyable reading.<br /><br />Of the four I read, this and the second (Chamber of Secrets), were the lightest and the easiest reading.  The third (Prisoner of Askaban)and especially the fourth (Goblet of Fire)increased in length and my speed in Spanish is pretty slow, so they took longer to read.  The fifth (Order of the Phoenix) and six (Half Blooded Prince) are about 900 pages so I am pretty intimidated to tackle them in Spanish.  I will read them in English and move on to some other Spanish books.<br /><br />After reading these I viewed the DVD's of the films.  They have the audio track in Spanish so you can train your ear, too.<br /><br />The books follow the English versions almost exactly, so you can have a copy of it around to refer to if you find yourself confused about a certain phrase or sentence.
