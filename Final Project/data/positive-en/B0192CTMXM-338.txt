Certainly a dramatic conclusion to the HP books.  Very well written and with enough twists and turns to keep your attention.  One remarkable conclusion upon finishing it was how the symbolism of the Master Mason's Degree can be found within the pages.  Don't know if Rowling has become a member of one of the Masonic obediences that accept women, but she sure has concluded her HP series with a new version of the 3rd Degree of Masonry.  This is a book for all ages not just young people.
