Well, this is it, this is where it all comes to an end as Harry Potter and his merry band of miscreants saddle up for one last adventure - to kill Voldemort by destroying those darn horcruxes that divide up his soul. Very little time is spent at Hogwarts until the climax, countless characters die (including the villain), but a happy ending is eventually had.<br /><br />All in all, a nice cap off to the Potter saga, even though JK Rowling completely and utterly failed at making Harry's romance with Ginny (Ron's sister) believable.
