I happen to think that so far, Order of the Phoenix is the most enjoyable Harry Potter book I've read. [still waiting for 7 though... ; )] Having it in audiobook format is amazing, because I love the story, but hardly ever have time to sit and read it through. With this, I can just put it on, and go about doing anything I need to get done around the house, or even listen as I'm out and about, or on an extended car trip. It is beautifully performed, and I would recommend any Harry Potter audiobook to anyone who is interested.
