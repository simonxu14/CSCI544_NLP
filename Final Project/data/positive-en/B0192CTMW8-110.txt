Audio books are my preferred way of enjoying a book. It's all in the &#34;Theater of the mind&#34;. I can picture what's happening the way I want it to look, not some film maker.<br />  I can work around the place while listening to a book series that changed the world.<br />AND the audio books are read by Jim Dale, an award winning man who also does all the voices, after much study. He's the best there is.
