Jim Dale's characterizations of Rowling's enormous cast of characters are superb.  He invents distinct voices for each one and hardly ever misses a change in even the most complex dialog.  This makes the audio production stand on its own merits and means it is entirely complementary to reading the book.  I recommend people do both!
