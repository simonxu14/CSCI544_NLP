I, too, cannot believe that the whole thing is finally over!  What a bittersweet feeling it is, to have all the loose ends wrapped up in such an IMMENSELY SATISFYING way, and yet at the same time experiencing a sense of loss because it has at last come to a close.  I found myself just staring, glazed over, at that scarlet inner back cover for a few minutes when I was done.  I know I'm not alone in feeling like I've just said goodbye to a dear friend.  And yet, I can't wait to reread the whole series from the beginning, knowing now what the "whole picture" is.  Still, the feeling of "not quite knowing" for all these years was so delicious!  This series is among the most epic fantasy series of our time, and appeals to people of all ages and walks of life.  A rousing toast to JKR!
