It was with a poignant nostalgia that I received this book, the last of the Rowling's tremendous series. I remember clearly that first one that I opened. A little late to the game, I remember thinking I couldn't believe I was to read about wizards and fairies, a book obviously meant for sniveling 10-year-olds, but as I was under orders to read it from my wife (She Who Must Be Obeyed), I dove in, fully intending for the book to be the last of Rowling I ever read.<br /><br />Now, years later, thinking back to every single book after that first one and the pleasure each brought during the glorious week (on average), it took to read, I can only say a heartfelt Thank You to J. K. Rowling.<br />The seventh does not disappoint. In some parts, the pace slows a bit and one wonders how it will all end, like the characters themselves, come to think of it. Not to worry, it's on again soon and the reader is treated to action, toil and trouble, heady stuff that through it all finds Harry hardening, becoming an adult and ready to handle the challenges thrown his way as The Boy Who Lived; to top it all off, there's an ending that is just delicious.<br /><br />I felt like at the end of a bountiful, never-boring feast lasting years: utterly sated and strangely, ready for more!<br /><br />By the way, as a Fred myself, I can't say I understand why my namesake had to be the one who went, when everyone knows George was the lesser twin! ;-)
