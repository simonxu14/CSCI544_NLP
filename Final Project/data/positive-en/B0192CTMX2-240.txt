Jim Dale is the man.  And the woman.  Okay, and the occasional Dark Lord, but holy smokes, if you haven't heard Harry Potter on CD, you need to. He does such a great job, and brings the characters to life, just like all the actors/actresses in the movies.  We love listening to this, and have done so multiple times on commutes and road trips.  Plus, our 10 month old enjoys it too (well, she doesn't scream and cry, so we imagine she likes it), and will fall/stay asleep when it's on.
