Personally, I think this is my favorite book of the series.  I only hope the producer of the newest film doesn't get the job of doing this movie!!<br /><br />The book does have the drawn out part of them on the run, after Ron left it just felt that it was going on forever....BUT it more than made up for it once things got on a roll.  WOW  is all I have to say for the second half of the book.  I absolutely adore Rowling's writing style and she does not let me down!<br /><br />The only thing I have to say about the ending....SPOILER ALERT IF YOU HAVEN'T READ IT!!!<br /><br />I don't think that she wrapped all the loose ends.  Had I not read it in an interview, I would not have known what Harry did for a living.  That was such an intrical part of the other books, it was always being mentioned.  That I felt we should have been told a bit more about what he did.  I, also hope that Kreacher made Sirius' house a home for him and Ginny!!  I love thinking of them raising their kids there.
