I waited so long for this book and was not disappointed with the almost 900 pages I got for my trouble.  I was also delighted to see that so many people were reading it!  I am a grad student and in the place wehere I work, everyone from the employee's kids to the security guards to the MDs had ordered it!  Rowling is SO real - the way she describes Harry's teenage inner thoughts and feelings is so intimate with the adolescent experience - just watching Harry struggle with that alone made the story interesting enough.  On top of that, I have always loved the fact that though the characters are witches and wizards, they succeed because of intelligence, practice, and bravery, not because something was just handed to them.  My only complaint about the book is that it hurt me deeply towards the end - I cannot say what that is because it is storyline related - you will know it when you see it (If it had to happen it should not have happened that way!). Lastly, I would like to say that I waited a very long time for this book, but as there must be some charm on it to keep people from putting it down, I finished it in one day.  Sooo... when is book 6 coming out?
