Ah, closure.  This was a good book and J.K.R. finished it well.  The story slowed a bit towards the middle of the book and too many one-off characters were popping up everywhere but once the three amigos set off the action picks up steam.  I would have no issues recommending this book to the reader.  It is quite worth the price.<br /><br />And as for the Epilogue, I am of the opinion that it was JUST PERFECT.  It aptly closes the series and gives us just a quick glimpse of what the world will be like and how the actions of those who did what they did leave an impact on us all.
