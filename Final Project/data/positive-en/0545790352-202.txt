If you think this edition with its wonderful illustrations will keep you, or a child you are considering buying it for, from fully using your imagination, you're wrong!  This is the edition I wish I could have given my young nephew to introduce him to the wonders of J.K. Rowling's stories.  The book is heavy, though, printed on high-quality, glossy paper.  I smiled as I paged through to look at the illustrations and can't wait to reread this first Harry Potter book, looking for the detail in each illustration.  Thank you, Jo Rowling, for allowing this book to be republished with illustrations, and thank you, Jim Kay, for the beauty of your work.
