This book is great. It was hard for me to get my 9 year old to put it down, all she wanted to do was carry it around with her everywhere we went. Every once in a while she would bust out laughing and would comment to me how exciting and interesting this book is. She's already read the previous books and is now asking me to order her the next book in the series. Way better than the movie.
