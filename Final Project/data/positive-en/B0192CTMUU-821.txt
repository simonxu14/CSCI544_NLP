Great tale!  Rowling reaches out and grabs you in the first chapter, and doesn't even let go in the last one.  Harry Potter and all the other wizards and muggles seem very real.  Harry, when faced with a difficult  decision, always seems to take the high road, although he does get in his  share of trouble, which makes him seem pretty normal, for a wizard!  I  can't wait to see what will happen in Rowling's 5th story!
