OK, Amazon shoppers. I'm not saying the BOOK is awful, but the way my daughter, son and I fight over it. My daughter had to start the Percy Jackson book series because her brother took so long on it. But my daughter sped through all the Percy Jackson series in less than a week. That's five books. I reccomend those as well as the Harry Potter.
