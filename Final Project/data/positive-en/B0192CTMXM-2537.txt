I really liked the 5th book. Although it was a very negative tone the whole way through. Much more negative then the other four. As Harry gets older his temper grows and nothing seems to go right for him. A sad but exellent ending. I don't want to spoil it but for a little hint...I NEVER would have expected the outcome. A tragic thing happens and it was such a shocker that I was mad about it. I definatly loved this book and it is my second favorite out of all five.
