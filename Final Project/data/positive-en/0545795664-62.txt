The book arrived with a crease on the front cover (paperback). It isn't a crease from wear it looks like the crease was done when they bound the book. Its slightly folded over on the inside. The outside has a gap in the plastic coating down the whole crease. Its going to tear off easily and I expect it to get a lot of use. I'm disappointed.
