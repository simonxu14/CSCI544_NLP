Even though I ordered 3 copies of "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" I was the last in my family to get ahold of the book.  I wanted undisturbed reading time and that is a rare commodity.  I rushed through the book since I needed to know what happened and missed many of the details in my hurry to finish.  I was able to really enjoy the subtleties driving in my car and listening to Jim Dale read the book to me.  My inner voice is not nearly as rich as Mr. Dale's and I was enchanted with his reading of the story.  I found myself sitting longer than need be in parking lots and in my driveway waiting for a chapter to end.  To term Mr. Dale versatile doesn't do justice to the variety of voices he produces.  Each character came alive and I found myself even more attached or repelled by many of them after hearing the cd.  Can't believe the saga is at an end.
