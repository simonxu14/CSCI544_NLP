I was so excited to get this book and read it. I sat and did nothing but read and read and read. I was so wrapped up in this one, just like all her other's before. It kept me interested, needing to keep going to find out what happens. A must read. Loved it all. I've so enjoyed her Harry Potter books that it saddens me that this is the last one. She did a grand job and you won't be disappointed in any of her books. This book too I highly recommend, but please start at book 1 and read them all to get the full effect and all the stories. Well worth the money and time.
