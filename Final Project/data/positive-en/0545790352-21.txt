This book is gorgeous from cover to cover - I could not be happier with my purchase!<br /><br />Pros: Fabulous original art, ribbon bookmark, almost every page has minute artistic details/differences, nice and easy-to-read, large font.<br /><br />Cons: I'm sure I missed the dimensions of the book before I bought it - but it's much larger than expected; shaped/sized more like a coffee table book. (Photo of &#34;standard&#34; book for comparison.)<br /><br />The pros far out way the cons though, believe me!
