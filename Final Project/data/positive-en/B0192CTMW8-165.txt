I bought the books as gifts for a 7 year old (advanced child) and 9 year old nephews in Pennsylvania.  I couldn't resist, having two grown sons who grew up on Terry Brooks, Robert Jordan, and others - I read them.  They  were wonderful!  And I have already given the parents of these two young  men a synopsis so that they won't worry - I told them to read them also.  Harry Potter, and his trials, will be understood by every age.
