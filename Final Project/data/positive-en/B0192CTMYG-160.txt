I loved this book, but when I read of the Sorcerer's Stone I had a nagging feeling about it at the back of my mind, until it struck me that all the  descriptions of it matched what I had always known as a Philosopher's  Stone. I first learned of the Philosopher's Stone when I was 10 years old  and read a book called &quot;Gone-Away Lake&quot; by Elizabeth Enright, and  then of course read more of it when studying European history.<br />As the  Encyclopedia Brittanica puts it: &quot;in alchemy, substance thought to be  capable of changing base metals into gold. The same term, more fully elixir  vitae, &quot;elixir of life,&quot; was given to the substance that would  indefinitely prolong life--a liquid that was believed to be allied with the  philosopher's stone.&quot;<br />I was quite confused, but then I discovered  that it England the book *was* originally called &quot;Harry Potter and the  Philosopher's Stone&quot;. This title makes so much more sense. What the  heck is a sorcerer's stone? Nothing. Why the change? Does Scholastic Books  just think American's are dumb, ignorant fools? I can't think of any other  reason for the change.<br />I do know that from now on I will buy my copies  of the books from the British publisher, rather than the &quot;dumbed  down&quot; American versions put out by Scholastic.
