Beautiful! For all potterhead fellows out there, the illustrations are far more like the book descriptions than movies could possibly be. Ron and Snape are my favs! I'm already waiting excitedly for the next ones. Worth each penny. It's a great gift for kids who are starting to read chapter books, once the font is big and the page text is divided in two columns. With that, plus the beautiful illustrations, I can see any kid engaged and determinated to finish it. Will definitely save it to read with my kids!
