True to her hints, Rowling has written a much darker novel this time.  The Order of the Phoenix signals a change in Harry and his life.  He is older, but not necessarily wiser, and is a very typical teenager.  Rather than write about a teen who is bypassed by puberty and all of the attendant woes, Rowling has chosen to confront girls, fame, anger, and the fact that Harry is starting to realize much more fully who he is and what he has to confront.  While the overall tone of the book is dark, there are some very funny moments and Rowling is at the top of her form.  And, Harry is not the only one who grows.  More than the previous four books, this one works with an ensemble cast.  In addition, Harry's actions have much more far-reaching consequences.  Harry and his friends are coming into their own and we are priviledged to be able to watch them.
