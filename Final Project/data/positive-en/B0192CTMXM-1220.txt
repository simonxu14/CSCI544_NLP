The book arrived in exactly the condition described in the listing, and within the 2 weeks of possible delivery, but came at nearly the end of that time. More recent purchases are also taking a long time to arrive, perhaps because I live 1000 miles from the vendor. If you order from them, you will likely get what you want in good order, but after a wait of up to 3 weeks.
