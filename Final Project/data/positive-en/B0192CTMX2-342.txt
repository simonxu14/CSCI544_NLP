My grandchildren and students wanted me to read Harry Potter.  I am a Special Education teacher in a girls' high school and my students are fantastic.  I adore my grandchildren and my students, so when they were all begging me to become &#34;Potter-literate&#34;, I took up reading the series with one of my granddaughters.  I borrow the books from my grandchildren and read them, then return them.  Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix came to me in sorry condition, and only got worse.  I felt so bad that I replaced it with this new copy and kept the old one for myself.  It may not be my usual reading fare, but it's very entertaining and imaginative.  A new copy of the book for a family of 7 children was a great gift, and all the kids (except for the 5 month old and the 4 year old) were very happy and appreciative.  Great book and very enjoyable, though not quite up there with the likes of Michener, Shakespeare, and the like.  It's rollicking good fun and now my grandchildren and students can relate on a whole new level now.
