This is her best written book, except for the last chapter. It was out of place and seemed like it was written previously; otherwise a masterpiece, and a great ending. The reason only 4 stars is she took a little from Lord of the Rings with the Horcruxes (compared to the ring), and ending in War. The books a little clich&eacute;, but so is life, and what did Harry Potter become? Still some questions, but overall I loved it and highly recommend it.
