As many reviewers here have mentioned, I'm overwhelmed by the quality of this book. The paper and the binding are of excellent quality, and it has a permanent spot on my bookshelf. An excellent present for anyone who loves Harry Potter. It would also make an excellent introduction to the series for those who haven't read it before.
