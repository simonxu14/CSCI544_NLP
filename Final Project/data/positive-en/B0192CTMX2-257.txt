I think that many people were disappointed by this installment of the Harry Potter series because J.K. Rowling tried to do something original here: make her characters REAL.  Sure, Harry has been a beloved character in the past four books, but that is exactly why he has hit this wall in his life.  Just remember, those of you that complain about book 5's "darkness" and Harry's "whinyness" or "failures" that this is exactly what Harry needs to become a better person, and eventually defeat V.<br /><br />This was a fantastic book, simply because it shows that Rowling has the ability not only to make her characters three dimensional people but to hold them there, even as they live in a fictional, magical world.  She doesn't lose her touch one bit.  And remember also, Rowling started this series because she wanted to write this story, not because the rest of the world wanted her to.  She is simply continuing to stick by that.<br /><br />This book is trying to show the chldren that have grown up with Harry Potter that the real world has a lot of hardships in it. Harry may have handled it badly, and he may not be the bright, perky person everyone loves, but that is what makes him real.  His failures make him stronger, his mistakes make him wiser, and that is what Harry needed.<br /><br />On a personal note, I thought the book was really wonderful.  Harry always worried me in the past, because he had that Oliver Twist life story, and I was afraid that he would grow boring, always being the smartest and the favored, etc.  I really wondered how Rowling could keep it going through seven books.  To show him at his worst proves to me that Rowling is a worthy writer, because she doesn't buckle to media, and isn't afraid of taking a chance.  Remember, if your hero is always good, and your enemy is always bad, you have static characters, a static story, and basically, nothing worth reading.<br /><br />The next book is going to be even better.  I predict it will be a little bit warmer and a little bit brighter, because Harry's failures are leading him towards the light, and the end of the tunnel.  Bring it on!
