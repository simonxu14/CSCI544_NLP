My eight-year-old son loves this book!  He had the paperback version, but he &#34;read&#34; it to pieces.  This book is much sturdier.  If your child is into Pokemon and enjoys reading about the many characters, I would highly recommend this book.  And I would very much recommend the library binding version for longevity.  This book is for someone who likes to play the Pokemon card game and enjoys reading about (sometimes memorizing) specifics about the characters.
