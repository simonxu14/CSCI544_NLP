Rather than review the book, which I find to be generally outstanding and a satisfying end to the series, I'd instead like to review Jim Dale's reading of it.<br /><br />This is my second "reading" of The Deathly Hallows, but my first foray into audiobooks. I thought it would be good filler during a road trip and beach vacation when I would be unable to actually pick up a book. Now home from that trip, I can't stop listening to it.<br /><br />Dale's pacing slows me down and allows me to appreciate details I probably skim past while reading at my usual steady clip. His inflection draws you in, brings Rowling's rich world out of the words, gives a wink and a nod during the fleeting happy moments, and sets you on edge as tension rises. He provides a distinctive and appropriate voice for each character, bringing life to their personalities.<br /><br />The one rather major exception I take is with Hermione's voice; the younger women's voices in general sound a bit strained, but not distractingly so. Hermione's parts, however, are spoken with a whiney inflection that elongates the last syllable of words and gets high and squeaky at the end ("Haa-rryyYYY"). Rather than making her sound reproachful or thoughtful, as I'm sure is intended, it makes her sound a bit dim-witted, almost like a thoughtless stereotype of someone with a disability. Emma Watson (Hermione in film), in contrast, manages to enunciate each syllable while simultaneously spitting out the words like the intellectual bullets they usually are.<br /><br />To sum it up: while drifting off into his otherwise excellent reading, it's jarring and distracting to suddenly have such strange portrayal of a character who speaks with such frequency.
