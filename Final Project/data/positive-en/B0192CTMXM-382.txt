With all of the hype over the supposed last book in the Harry Potter series, I did end up buying this one. (pre-order! It's the way to go!) I'm glad that I did. While it did have a slightly different feel to it than the others, it was still a good read. I was slightly disappointed during the middle of the book where J.K. Rowling filled the book with pages of what the book could have easily done without. Nonetheless, in the end, I have to say it was a great book. I won't ruin the story for you- read it for yourself.
