Wow!  What great books!  I was kind of skeptical at first, thinking this series couldn't possibly live up to all the hype, but boy have they!  I read all three in less than 48 hours, and I'm dying for the fourth one to  come out.<br />If you have young kids, buy these books and read them together  every night before bed.  If you don't have kids, read them on your  own!<br />Ms. Rowling's characters are beautifully created, and her  descriptions of Harry's adventures draw you in faster than you can say  &quot;Azkaban!&quot;  I highly recommend these.....ENJOY!
