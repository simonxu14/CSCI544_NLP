What can I say except WOW!  Jo Rowling has to be one of the truly great writers of our time.  Book 5 introduces new characters who are incredibly well-developed.  Dolores Umbridge is one of the most hateful characters I have ever encountered, but her introduction into the series makes it so fasinating that it is nearly impossible to put this book down for even a minute.  I am reading it now for the third time and, as with all of the HP series, JKR has hidden information that is key to the entire storyline in nooks and crannies that can only be discovered by reading and rereading.  The main trio, Harry, Ron and Hermione are developing into very interesting teens.  I love the Weasley twins and there is a section devoted to them that is priceless!  Luna Lovegood is also a most interesting character and I was happy to see that her character was fleshed out in this book.  The spells are getting more interesting and the drama surrounding Lord Voldemort is getting more intense now that he has returned to his body.  Neville's character has developed too and that is great!  After my first read, I was quite disturbed with the events in Order of the Phoenix, but after the second read, I was enraptured just as I was with the previous 4 books.  If you haven't already, read this book and then read it again.  It just keeps getting better and better!!  Another Winner from JK Rowling!
