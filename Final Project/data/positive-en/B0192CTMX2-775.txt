The plot of this book is predictable to anyone who read the first 4 books. Lord Voldermot is back bat he doesn't do much and lets his enemies quarrel between themselves. I.e., the ministry of magic versus Dambledor and the Order of the Pheonix.<br />At first I found the new Harry Potter book a bit dissapointing because the title was wrong! We learn very little about the Order of the Phoenix, so better names might have been: "Harry Potter and the High Inquisitor" or "Harry Potter and the lost Prophecy". Which brings me to the real problem in this book -  the absence of one clear subject as it was in the previous books. Another thing that really dissappointed me was the death of an important character which was really crule considering its place in Harry's life and it's own misrable life - He deserved better.<br />So why did I give this book a 5? because it was intersting, Reviting, full of adventures and wonderfully portrayed characters. Full of twist and turnes in a world I have come to know and love, I can't wait to the next one.
