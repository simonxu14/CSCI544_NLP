I originally ordered the set of books for my children after hearing the rave reviews since &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; started flying off the shelves.  Unfortunately the books continued to be put to the wayside due to homework and busy schedules.  I am an avid reader of medical mystery and horror thrillers, so reluctantly I picked up this book convinced that it would never live up to the hype as portrayed by the media.  Boy was I wrong.  This was truly a remarkable story that lives up to the highest ranking reviews.  I am now reading the third volume and the stories keep getting better with each page.  J.K. Rowling is brilliant!
