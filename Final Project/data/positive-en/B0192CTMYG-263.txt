I love these books. They are all great. I just had to re-buy this one, because a friend borrowed it and never returned it.<br />I have two daughters and I love finding books with strong female characters. I want to teach my children to be smart, strong, and loyal. These books have all that in them and so much more. If you want to talk to your children about bullies or bigotry these books have that as well.
