Harry Potter came to my attention when a group of 10 year olds I work with told me it was their favorite book.  I read it and went on to read book 2,3, & 4.<br />Harry Potter is so well written that I would never consider it just a children's book.  This is a rare book that both children and adults can enjoy together.  The imagery and imagination of J.K. Rowling shines through on every page.  A must-read for anyone who has a bit of kid left in them!
