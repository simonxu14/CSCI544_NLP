The recordings of J.R. Rowlings' books are without a doubt the most entertaining of any audio book I've listened to. The combination of Rowlings writing and Jim Day's narration is a perfect match. Jim Day is extraordinary in his ability to take on the voices of the many characters in the book and keep them all separate so the listener knows who is talking. This book is more difficult, I think, than some of the earlier books because more characters are being introduced while characters from the earlier books are still part of the cast. My family enjoys listening to these recordings again and again. They will be favorites for a long time.
