This is exactly what we needed.  I had bought my son a set of 144 mini pokemon figures and we didn't know what a majority of the Pok&eacute;mon were.... so we bought this guide.<br /><br />My 6 year old is able to easily find the Pok&eacute;mon, learn how to pronounce the name, and find the evolutions.  It is perfect for getting younger kids into reading too.
