I am a retired lawyer and I generally do not read fiction because I feel it is a waste of my time.  I read the first Harry Potter book because I had heard so much about it.  Now I am hooked on the series.  The books have many layers and each one seems better and more complex than the previous one  These books can be enjoyed at many levels so they are not just for the young.  To really "get" the movies, it is necessary to read the book first too.  I gave this book "only" four stars because I think book 4 will be even better.  I do recommend reading the series in order though starting with book 1.
