Of course I can only say good things about J.K. Rowling & Jim Dale (who so wonderfully brings the book to life) ... I love the story, I love the narration... the only thing that I noticed (having purchase all books on CD) ... is that the attention to detail, art and quality of the cover & packaging is not as good as the previous sets... but still 100 % worth the purchase.
