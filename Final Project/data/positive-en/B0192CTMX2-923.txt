The last of the Harry Potter series wraps everything up into a nice bundle and has readers feeling glad that they have shared their lives with these characters.  This series has coined new words and literally changed the lives of so many readers throughout the world. It is a joy and a learning experience to see children of all ages exploring the written word and becoming captivated by it. It demonstrates the power of the written media, and it separates those people actually interested in proactive entertainment vs. the passive genre like movies.<br /><br />All went well for Harry and his cohorts.  Things are more than they appear, and small seemingly unimportant details actually become pivotal.  Congratulations to JK Rowling for her imagination and fortitude!!!
