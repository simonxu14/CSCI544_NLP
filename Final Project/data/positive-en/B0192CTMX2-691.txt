My actual rating is 4 1/2 stars because I had several problems with the book.  One minor problem was that it's been so long since I've read any of the other books, I forgot most of the characters and events that happened in them.  But a pro is that during the end of the book, we find out more new information than all the other books combined (my opinion).  Another con is that most people know that J. K. Rowling already said that someone she thinks is a main character, dies.  This person IS a main character, and I could've picked about fifty other people who could've died and the book would've been beter.  Unlike some people, I like when the books are long.  When the books come out years apart, I don't want to be able to finish one in two days.  Also, for the people who really enjoy the Quiditch part of these books, there won't be mutch of that.  Like one person already said, reading this book does make you depressed sometimes.  Things just keep getting worse and worse.  But overall, I think this book is the best one in the series.  You learn so much about the Harry Potter storyline and all the characters.  If you want to know a little sneak peak, you get see Harry's father when  he was 15.  This is really interesting.
