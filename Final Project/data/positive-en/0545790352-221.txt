Wow!  This version was fantastic.  I've always been a Harry Potter fan and love the story.  It's a great, fun story for kids and adults alike.  This year I decided I wanted to read it to my third grade class.  I decided to get the illustrated edition since it was just so beautiful and my students enjoy pictures with the books we read during Read Aloud time.  The illustrations in this edition are absolutely stunning!  Each one is done in gorgeous detail.  Even the pages with no illustrations have small details that turn them into works of art.<br /><br />The paper is nice and thick as well, so no worries about it ripping.  The illustrations are in full color and completely wonderful!<br /><br />As a heads up: the text seems to be the original british text.  There were a few words and phrases in there that my students were puzzled by, but that just led to wonderful discussions about how language can change between two countries.  My kids actually found it fascinating to listen for words and phrases that are not used here in the US.
