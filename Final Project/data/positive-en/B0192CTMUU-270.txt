The Goblet of Fire gives a lot of detailed information about characters and clues of upcoming events (revealed in books 5 and 6).  Its the best of the series to date and is richly descriptive.  This book is a "must read" for Harry Potter fans, particularly those who only see the movies.  The upcoming film cannot possibly give the rich detail revealed in this book. Its well worth re-reading several times.  Harry Potter and friends are maturing into teens with new emotions and challenges; this transition is most sensitively portrayed by J.K. Rowling.
