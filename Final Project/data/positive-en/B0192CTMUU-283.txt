Gripping, action packed, lots of villians, lots of heros, new magical creatures, new spells, twists and turns, and most of all, LOTS OF FUN!  Started reading it at 9 PM Sunday night and finished it at 3:30 AM. (Good  thing I'm the mommy!) Rowling has created a delightful world full of  extremely well-developed characters and a spell-binding plot. I think that  &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; is the best &quot;Harry Potter&quot; so far. I  just wish Rowling could write as fast as I read. Hats off to Harry!
