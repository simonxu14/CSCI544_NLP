One of the best purchases I've ever made! We are huge Harry Potter fans in this house and already have several copies of the books. I have the paperback set that lines up to show an illustration of Hogwarts which sits on our main bookshelf, then I have a set of original hardbacks for my Harry Potter collection shelf, and then I have several copies of each book for my classroom library. This illustrated edition is my new favorite part of my Harry Potter collection! The illustrations are GORGEOUS!  The book is hard cover with a beautiful illustrated paper sleeve. The pages are thick and sturdy. The pictures have many hidden secrets and you could spend hours at a time just looking at the details of the illustrations.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next illustrated edition to be released.
