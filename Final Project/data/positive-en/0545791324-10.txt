Another absolutely beautiful book! I have been loving these books. I already loved the Harry Potter Series, and I love these illustrated books. The art work is great, and the colors are bright and vibrant. I did notice in this book, that, especially towards the end, the artwork gets darker, but that also falls in line with the book itself, as the books get more serious and darker as the series progresses. The ribbon in this book is orange, and I did like that they used a different color than the first book. I would highly recommend this book to collectors. I cannot wait to have the full set!!
