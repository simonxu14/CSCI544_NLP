I got hooked on these books by accident around when the second movie came out.  After that, I had to read them all and I was one of those people who would buy the book at the midnight release.<br />The same happened with my mother so I started buying them for her on in large print so she could easily read them without straining her eyes.<br />The story is simple without being too over-the-top fantasy (my opinion) like other series I could never really get into.
