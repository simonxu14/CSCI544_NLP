After more than 4,000 reviews have been written about this book, what's left to say?<br /><br />I love this series of book and listen to them on CD in the car. They really make my long commute bearable. This book is quite different from the earlier ones in a number of ways:<br /><br />1) Good news: Harry is growing up. This book shows a bit darker side of 14-year old Harry, who is perhaps going through adolescent angst. He has a rather long-lasting argument with his best friend Ron that shows Harry to be stubborn and sometimes unreasonable. He also has his first crush on a girl, which increases his state of confusion. I felt this increasing complexity of his character adds a welcome depth to the series.<br /><br />2) Bad news: The book overall is darker than previous ones. While there are still traces of humor in this book, there are also rather frightening scenes (the opening scene in which a muggle is killed and scenes at the end involving torture and death). I'm not sure this is appropriate for very young children.<br /><br />3) Bad news: For the first time, I became aware of long, long passages of exposition. (Since I listen to these books on CD,  it is very noticeable when one character spends twenty minutes explaining background material.) Rowling's strength has always been moving the story along quickly and entertainingly--having a character explain something rather than showing it is surprising for her.<br /><br />4) Good news: The reader of the audio book, Jim Dale, is fantastic! He easily takes on the persona of each character and I quickly forget I am listening to someone reading. What a great actor he is! He has done all of the Harry Potter audio books and is a great choice!
