I waited 10 years for this and I was not disappointed. Rowling kept her promise, and gave Potter fans the best of herself. Book 6 made me a bit apprehensive about the ending as well as the quality of the read, but my fears were allayed from the first chapter. The writing was the best since Book 4; the comedy and the darkness were offered up in satisfying amounts. I would not, could not ask for more.
