Okay, book 5. Here it is, and what a wonderful read it was! Very entertaining, enlightening, and engrossing. I found the book covers a great deal for a 15 year Wizard dealing with more "grown-up" stuff. This book contains wonderful stories, subplots, and is more focused. We are introduced to some really wonderful - if nasty - characters...particularly Professor Umbridge! Talk about professional educational expertise gone amuck!<br />J K Rowling displays again her talents in telling a really good story. How she keeps it all straight is amazing. This tale is darker for sure, but not without its moments of lightness and not without a bit of fun. The various new creatures also add to the book and the discoveries that only youth in this book can figure out. Yet, I also see a more mature Harry emerging from this book through his emotions and confusion. Confusions that reminded me at times of my harrowing adolescence - without the witch or wizard craft. I also give the author credit. She does not let this "tale" become too pat...there are suprises in this book and some that will place the reader in the mode to want more - particularly at the end of the book. She does fill in some holes for us, but as every one will guess...it is not all well in the Potter world for his future...J.K. Rowling ...cheers! What a wonderful book.
