Talk about realism in young adult fiction!  Ms. Rowling has captured the angst & confusion of those first awful years of hormones!<br />I did enjoy this-- there's no attempt made to sugar-coat life or experiences here.  Ms. Rowling is not afraid to explore some of the less pleasant occurances in most adolescents' lives-- awkwardness & confusion about the opposite sex; adults who excercise dictatorial powers over students just 'cause they can; adults trying to deal with serious events without sitting down & giving real information to 'the children' who are not exactly children anymore; etc.<br />Younger (say under age 11) children may not enjoy this book at the moment, but the teen audience should be able to identify well with the tummalt of emotions presented in this book.<br />The plot development here gives Ms. Rowlings many different ways to go in the next 2 books of the series.  Now just waiting for the next installment....<br />Another great book for the series!
