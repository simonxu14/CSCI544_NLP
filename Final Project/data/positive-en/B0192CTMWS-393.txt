As a fantasy fiction author, I enjoyed all of J.K. Rowling's works, although I felt the earlier books were more sharply edited and had a greater dramatic tension. The creative ending of the series is the strength of this book, where she does not tightly wrap up all the loose ends, and it is not a happily-ever-after in that everybody walks away with a smile. Instead, the story captures the rough-edged reality of life, where even when things get resolved in the hero's favor, that triumph may be edged with sadness and loss. - Author Claudia Newcorn
