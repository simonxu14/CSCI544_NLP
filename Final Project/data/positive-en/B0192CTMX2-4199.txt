I, the notorious cheapskate, paid money to have book #7 delivered on 7/21.  I then sat down with my box of kleenex to read it cover to cover. I stayed off-line and read no papers so no one could spoil it for me. It was so worth it.  I really enjoyed the way JKR tied all the ends together and still surprized me.  I'm very sorry to see the series end, as it was Harry Potter who finally convinced my daughter that reading is a pleasurable thing to do.  For that alone I will be forever greatful.  Thank you J.K. Rowling, for bringing some magic to my life.
