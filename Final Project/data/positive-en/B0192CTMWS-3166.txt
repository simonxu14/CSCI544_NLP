Jim Dale, who reads/preforms all of the Harry Potter audio books, is an extremely talented reader.  He does realistic voices for each of the different characters, in varying accents (English, Scottish, etc.) that are incredibly genuine.  I've read all of the books at least twice, but I feel like I get so much more (if that's possible!) out of the audio versions because Jim Dale's acting is so accurate.  His inflections and timing are perfect, and he is very articulate.  I listen to the HP books over and over in my car on the way to work, and (after at least 50 combined playings) have yet to get sick of them.  A must have for all HP fans and lovers of literature.
