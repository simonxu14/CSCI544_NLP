Having just finished the last instalment in the series, I have to say that JK Rowling has excelled in her conclusion to the epic tale of Harry Potter. Though I have a few personal favorites in the series, such as HP & the Prisoner of Azkaban, HP & the Goblet of Fire, and HP & the Half-Blood Prince, the last of the series is a fitting ending, with all the loose ends tied up.<br /><br />I loved the focus on Harry's internal struggles in deciding which step to take all through this final quest of his, be it in deciding where to go, or which to focus on, the Horcruxes, or Hallows...we see the true maturing of Harry Potter here, no longer just a boy wizard, but a true, almost adult wizard, a remarkable and potent force of good to fight the dark force of Voldemort and company.<br /><br />The focus on the ties of kinship and friendship are also explored here most convincingly. The trio of Harry, Hermione & Ron find their friendship tested to the limits, and not always in agreement with each other, and we even have one of the group leaving, though briefly...but always, their loyalty to one another holds them together.<br /><br />As Rowling had warned there are some familiar, even beloved characters that we bid farewell to here, and some in such an abrupt manner, that i truly didn't know how to react to the deaths. I wish that Rowling had spent a bit more time on these characters, perhaps in elaborating on the specifics of how they were killed.<br /><br />All in all, its been a great ride, and i am immensely grateful for the story of Harry Potter, his amazing friends, and wonderful world. I only wish it didn't have to end [I am going back to book one and re-reading the series over again!].
