Oh my gosh, J.K. Rowling outdid herself with the final chapter in Harry's life.  The book is fabulous.  I'm glad I did not read any reviews or listen to people before the book was out on Saturday.  I started it the minute the mailperson brought it and finished within 24 hours.  Amazing throughout and no less than we would expect.  Enjoy reading and hopefully people have not revealed too much before you do!
