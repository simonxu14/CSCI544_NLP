i enjoyed it. wrapped up things nicely and in a fairly decent way. people died - some that hurt to read. i liked harry all the way thru... keeping in mind he was a 17-yr-old that was being asked to possibly die and all he really wanted to do most the time was be with the girl he liked... we were mostly in his head with his unvarnished desires. why wouldn't he want that? i liked all of them. i will miss them.<br />read some of the negative reviews and I don't quite understand. this is a kids series. the somewhat trite epilogue does what the younger readers needed. that there aren't a lot of surprises... is unsurprising. didn't see any "adult situations" that my younger relatives shouldn't be reading... Ginny gives Harry a kiss on his b-day... big deal. and ron says "effing" a couple times - spelled like that - so i imagine that's okay. some typos - Lucious (thats probably mispelled) is referd to as Malfoy for about a page... that was a little confusing as he and voldermort were discussing Malfoy (that was the major one).<br />The only reason it loses one star is that i thought it could have stood a bit of editting. more back story on harry's parents maybe - got a bit convoluted with the Albus stuff and i think perhaps JKR wanted to just wrap it up in a nice bow at the end... it didn't quite fit. the final duel is a let down. just sort of want to mumble "that's it?"<br />It did drag in places but I figure that it was basically a war book... that's what war is. long periods of boredom marked by startling blinding violence. It did bother me that harry, ron & hermone seemed to be dueling to disarm instead of kill right to the end. bit stupid. their loved ones were dying - they should have been... at the very least using some more brutal curses.<br />In all, this is probably the third best in the series coming in behind the 4th and the 3rd where i felt the series peaked. It was a sweet ending though and I wasn't diasappointed.
