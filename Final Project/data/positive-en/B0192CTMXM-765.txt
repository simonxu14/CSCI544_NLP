Joe Rowling has once again out done herself. Her latest book Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix casts Harry into a fresh wave of anxiety write from the start, when he can't fail to notice that Dumbledore has seem to forgotten him. What's worse is that Harry also seems to develop more of a sting in his personality that has been getting him into more trouble than usual, especially with the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Of course, there are still messes from last year that haven't been cleaned up. Harry has to deal with old school enemies, and the Ministry of Magic, which stoops to new lows to discourage the fact that Voldermort has really returned. The reason I rate the book so high is because it is truly an experience reading it. I guarantee that by the end you will have experienced every type of emotion known to man. At times, the words on the pages begin to sound so real and swirled with feelings that you would swear the whole thing was really happening. Joe Rowling has successfully written Harry Potters 5th year at Hogwarts.
