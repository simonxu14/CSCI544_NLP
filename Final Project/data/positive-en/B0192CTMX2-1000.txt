If you've never listened to audiobooks, you have to start with the Harry Potter series.  Narrator Jim Dale gives each character his or her own voice so that the longer you listen, the easier it is to tell who is talking before it is actually revealed.  The Deathly Hallows is the icing on the cake of the best series of books written in recent years.  J.K. Rowling is a genius.  The final explanation of many of the mysteries of the earlier books is revealed in this 7th and best (in my opinion) of the series. Buy it and listen to it on audio, then go back and buy all the others and enjoy them all.  You won't be disappointed!
