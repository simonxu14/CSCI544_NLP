I'm a Harry Potter fan from my first reading of HP1, and I have all the books in audio format so I can listen to them whenever the mood strikes. I love the world of Harry Potter that J.K. Rowling created, and it's always a pleasure to visit it for the weeks it takes me to get through the audio books (once a year or so). I was a bit skeptical about this illustrated version when I first heard about it; one more way for the Harry Potter franchise to keep rolling in the dough, I thought. Then a friend brought her copy to show me, and I fell in love with it. It's a beautiful book to hold in one's hands. I don't need to read the words, having more or less memorized them, but Jim Kay's illustrations are lovely to gaze at when all I want is a reminder of the wonderful imaginary world of Harry Potter.
