Oh my gosh! This book is absolutely stunning! Great for every Harry Potter fan out there! And an added bonus...the inside of the book is the British version!!!! I was so excited when I realized this and love being able to read Harry Potter to my 4 year old without him getting bored because there are plenty of pictures for him to look at!
