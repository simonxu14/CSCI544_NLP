I love Harry Potter, & the world J. K. Rowling created. So when I saw this book I was very intrigued. I was blown away from the first moment I opened the cover. The art is absolutely stunning! There's different artistic styles, there's little drawings that are like hidden gems inside grand sweeping views that pull you in, & every image is beautiful. But, what I really like about this book, is that every word from the Sorcerer's Stone is here. Usually with big &#34;art books&#34; they skip on the actual story part of the book, because it's more about the art. Not in this one! You're not missing a thing from the story in this book, & I love it!
