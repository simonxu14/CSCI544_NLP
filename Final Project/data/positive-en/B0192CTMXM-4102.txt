I've read all of the Harry Potter books aloud to my son (who is now 10), and, while we're not yet far into Deathly Hallows, we can see that it will be as fun as all the others. We became engrossed in it from Page One. We're excited to see how the series ends, but we'll miss reading it. It's not only been a good read, but a great experience for us to have together. He could certainly be reading it alone at this point, but we wouldn't miss the shared enjoyment.
