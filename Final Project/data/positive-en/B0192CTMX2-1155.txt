Of course I'm dissapointed that the series has ended but the conclusion in the seventh book was satisfactory. Harry lives and we are allowed a peak into his future and see that he is happy ever after--we hope. Rowlings may change her mind and write anotehr book about Harry. Imagine his children in danger and him coming to the rescue with his buddies.
