This last installment of Harry Potter is my favorite.  The author answers all of your burning questions and ties things up quite nicely.  Action, magic, mystery, tragedy and love - this book has it all.  WOW, what a way to end an epic.  If I say too much, I may give something special away.  If you have never read Harry Potter, start with the first book and read till the end - you won't be disappointed (well, you may be when it ends).
