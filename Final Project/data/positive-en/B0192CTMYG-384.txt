This series is rather in the line of the C.S. Lewis Narnia books;  both place young children from the ordinary world into a magical one and transport us to a place where reality is slightly bent.<br />Rowling's knack for detail is remarkable, from Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans to the ins and outs of Quidditch.  A wonderful story.  I only wish these books had been around when I was a kid.  They're fabulous reading for one and all.
