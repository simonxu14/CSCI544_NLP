I have been reading this book to my 7 year old daughter every night and I have never seen her this excited about reading during bed time. This is a big book so we only have been reading half a chapter a night. Although I must admit if it was up to her, we'd be reading a couple of chapters a night. The illustration in this book is so engaging. I also have never read the book so this ended up being a treat for me too.
