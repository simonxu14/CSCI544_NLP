Harry finally returns to us, and it was worth the wait.  For us at least--not sure about him.<br />JK Rowling has again shown her imagination and creativity, as well as her understanding of humanity (teenaged boys especially), and has given us a compelling book, again geared toward an older audience than the first three.<br />Harry's charmed life at Hogwarts--celebrity, youngest Quidditch player in a century, humble, bright, gifted--begins to unravel a bit, and he has quite a lousy year at school.  But not to fear--it gets really awful after that.<br />The book is as compelling as the first four, and quite a quick read in spite of its imposing size.<br />Excellent effort.  The only thing that saddened me more than the well-publicized death is the realization that I've only two more books to read, and then I'll be saying good-bye to Harry forever.
