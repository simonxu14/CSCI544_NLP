Such a stupid story, BUT so interesting! ... I just cannot put it down. So many neat ideas, the gateway in the station, the wand choose it's master, the all-flavor snacks, the Quiddith contest. I found myself fell into a  dreamworld named Hogwarts. It's an imaginary and dream world where good and  evil fights, dazzling, flashing, with knighthood.
