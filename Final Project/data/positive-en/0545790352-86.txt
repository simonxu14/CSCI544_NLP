We were very excited to receive the illustrated edition of our favorite book. This illustrations are vivid and imaginative. Though some are a little too Tim Burton-esque. However, something must have gone wrong when they set the text, because page after page contains errors in the text. Sometimes words are missing, sometimes words are changed. It's like they put so much effort into the illustrations they forgot about the story in the text. Comparing the text to previous editions of the book there are numerous errors. It is not an issue of not being Americanized, but for instance on p135, Malfoy speaking, &#34;You'll be for it this time, Potter...&#34; when it should be &#34;You'll be in for it this time, Potter...&#34;
