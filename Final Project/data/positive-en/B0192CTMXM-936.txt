As an avid reader of the last 4 books, I scurried to pre-order this book in january as soon as it went on sale.  When it arrived on June 21, I spent the entire day engrossed in the pages, and was not disappointed in the amazing story that unfolded before me.  Harry goes through all the emotions that any 15 year old does - self pity, angst, anger, puppy love, & guilt over feelings he has. As I read, I was swept away into memories of similar emotions growing up. Rowling hits it right on the head.  Some might complain at the length, but I cherished every adjective & description that make Hogwarts so real. Reading this swept me away into a world that I can't wait to re-visit when I re-read each book over and over.  Bring on book 6!
