Unless you have spent the past few years in the wilderness, or in a coma, JK Rowling's tale of "The Boy Who Lived" is a familiar epic that, with luck, you have read and savored more than once.  "The Deathly Hallows" is the culmination of the journey, and a savory one it is.  Ms Rowling's magical world is one that we enjoy, not merely because of its realism, but because of the rare combination of the mundane and the fantastic. We can accept the existence of magic because the characters leap from the pages and live in our imaginations. The spells and incantations don't necessarily advance the plot--or substitute for plot development.  They flow naturally from the events that the characters face and react to.  The author isn't trying to convince us that wands and fantastical creatures do or should exist in our lives, but that, in this world, they do, and that the characters use the tools that they have.  Read the "Iliad" or "The Divine Comedy", and you will see the same striving to overcome the impossible.<br />  Ms Rowling, I look forward to whatever genre you turn to next. It has been a pleasure and an honor to watch you hone your craft and develop your gift.
