I have been listening to the Harry Potter series for the last three books, when my lifestyle changed and I no longer could find the time to sit down to actually read the books.  Since the only time I have is during commuting, audio book is the only way I could fit in such a luxury.  I don't think I could even go back to the reading them myself, even if I could find the time.
