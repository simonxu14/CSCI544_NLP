Often, sequels don't hold a candle to the books that preceed them.  This is an exception to the rule.  Rowling has done yet another excellent job of following up great with better than great.  Without giving the plot away,  Harry is again faced with danger to overcome that does not step anywhere  near the realm of monotony.  Rowling's imagination is boundless and  unpredictable, every chapter leaves you chomping at the bit for what's  coming in the next one.  New characters are introduced into a seamless  genre developed and adhered to by all four books.  The characters that we  already know remain true to their natures yet are every bit as  unpredictable as they have ever been.  The author has again masterfully  blended human motivation, humor, intrigue, suspense and imagination in a  700+ page book you'll wish was double in size. If you haven't read the  previous three, Rowling does an excellent job of referencing and briefly  explaining occurrences in all previous books so you're not left wondering  and not too elaborately to bore you if you have.  However, missing out on  the first three books and just reading this one is a form of  self-deprivation I would not recommend.  For the moment, I'm glad Harry's  adventures have paused for a year, if there was a new Harry Potter book  released once a week, I'd never get any work done. Enjoy!
