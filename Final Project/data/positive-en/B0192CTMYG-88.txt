A couple of months ago, I asked my ten year old grandnephew Joe what he'd been reading lately.  He proceeded to tell me about an unbelievable game called 'Quidditch', a wondeful place called 'Hogwarts', and an out of place  but very special person, Harry Potter.<br />OK, it's not Tolkien, Tolstoy,  Shakespeare, Gabaldon or Uris.  J.K. Rowling communicates a remarkable  perception of childhood fears, and the abdurd, out of place, self-defensive  nature of early teenagers in an upsetting, unknown, uncertain and very  dangerous world.<br />Sorcerer's Stone is a fun read, replete with magical  family heirlooms, talented sturigiforms and other family 'pets', plot  twists that are interesting and unexpected, and solid, growing friendships  between characters of very different age, size, likes, personalities and  abilities.<br />Remarkably, diversity and respect for the individual play a  strong part in this and later Harry Potter adventures.  Harry gets pushed,  but doesn't push back too hard.  His response to negative people and events  is to wonder why, not to strike out - even when facing a deadly  enemy.<br />The recommendation for 9 to 12 year olds must be based entirely on  the reading level, rather than the content.  Adult readers will enjoy  Sorcerer's Stone as a relaxing 'between book' as much as young readers  enjoy it as recreational reading.<br />But beware! If a group of kids sees you  reading this book, expect to be quizzed on every detail!
