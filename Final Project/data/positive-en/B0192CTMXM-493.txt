The imagination of J.K. Rowling is magical. If you have the first 6 books of Harry Potter this one completes the set. From the very first one &#34;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&#34;  clear through to this last one. &#34;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows&#34; J.K. Rowling has created a magic world of make believe and excitement  for children and adults alike. I would reccomend these books for all who loves fantasy!
