Wonderful - I have to get that out. JK Rowling's ability to put an engaging and real feeling life onto paper is absolutely wonderful, and this book is no exception. Throughout it, you are thrust into the story, which moves at a fast pace, and keeps you surprised as you struggle to understand what is happening to Harry, the Ministry of Magic, and Lord Voldemort himself. You wonder why Harry seems so angry all the time, and why the Ministry is working against Dumbledore, Harry, and the Order of the Phoenix. You get caught up, and you aren't dissapointed at the end either. It fits the book so well, I don't think anyone could have come up with a better one. (I cannot tell you the ending, of course)<br />The only problems are the characters. They seem a little out of place this time. I find it hard to believe that Dumbledore would hex not only Fudge, but three Aurors. And I find it harder to belive that even the Ministry would allow Umbridge the power she had. However, these are minor nits and they fail to detract from the magic of the book.<br />This book, in my opinion, is the best one she has ever written, and a must-get by any Harry Potter fan!
