I absolutely LOVE the Harry Potter series, and it is definitely one of my favorite series that I have ever read.  When I first started reading them I wasn't really sure that I would like them as I had unfortunately thought it was 'nerdy' when I was in school, and it was definitely a huge mistake!  It is still a very good read as an adult, but I really wish that I had started reading them when they came out.  I wanted my kids to be able to experience the magic of Harry Potter while they are young enough to believe in that kind of magic so we have started reading them together, and then watching the movie that coincides with the book.  They love the series as well though I don't think they like it as much as me since my daughter 'teases' me about it.  :)<br /><br />This book is captivating from the very first sentence.  J.K. Rowling is a very gifted writer and is descriptive enough to be able to transport you to her world without being so wordy that you find yourself losing interest.  If you have not read this book yet then read it!  You will not be disappointed.
