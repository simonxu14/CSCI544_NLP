I was somewhat skeptical at first but when I receiver it, boy was I blown away!!! The sheer size and quality was an immediate &#34;WOW!&#34;. It's large and has amazing art throughout the pages. It even has a built-in bookmark--perfect for reading to children. It's great for sparking imagination while reading to them. I love this and I can't wait for each and every one.
