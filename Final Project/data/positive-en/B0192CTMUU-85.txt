The Harry Potter books are such a pleasure to read that you can't help wondering as you pick up each new volume if This Time Rowling will have failed, and finally turned out a formulaic series book, dumbed down for  prevailing views of mass consumption, and lacking in the elctricity that  charges through the previous books.  I am happy to report that such is  definitely NOT the case.  The Goblet of Fire is a massive read, yet it  pulls you in from the first page, and will not release its hold until the  last.  Harry is as charismatic as ever, adrift in insecurity and anchored  by basic goodness.  The book is indeed darker than its predecessors, but  Rowling knows the limits of her youngest audience and never places their  sensibilities in harm's way.  There are new, intriguing, and delightful  characters, with hints of recurring roles in the future.  The adventures  are exciting, and never trite or hackneyed.  All in all, the book is a  charmer in itself, even without the backstory of the ones that went before.  Like the thousands of others who got it yesterday, I gave up sleep and  finished it overnight. (And I am long past the target age listed above!)  Thank you, J.K. Rowling.
