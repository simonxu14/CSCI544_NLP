If you love Harry Potter buy this book.  Its one of my lifes 'Hidden Gems' that is so well done, I spread its cheer through the random gift giving of it.  Honestly if you can't get enough HP, just buy it now.  Its amazing how much work had to have gone into its excessive illustrations, and I can't believe they are going to release (hopefully) the entire series since the second book is do out soon.  Once again, I'm blown away with everything about it and the only bad thing I have to say is its slightly difficult to read in bed because its loaded with heavy high quality paper that makes it pretty hefty on your tummy.  Its really not a complaint but I can't imagine the last couple books being readable on anything other than a table or some sort of reading apparatus that I have yet to own.  Maybe a sheet music holder thingy.  Just buy it already!
