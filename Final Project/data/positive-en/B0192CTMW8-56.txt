I LOVE HARRY POTTER!!! WOOHOOO!!! I'M so happy I finally finished this book! I liked it very much. It only took me a lot of time to read it cause I never really liked the second of this series or any series. I finished it this morning in the bus and I just felt like I wanted to scream that I WAS FINISHED!!!<br /><br />OK. Let's talk serious about this book now. ***SPOILER ALERT*** (even if everyone already read the book or saw the movie, like daw)<br />-Professor Lockhart really got me on my nerves the whole freeking book! I'm so glad that ass lost him memory! He's so stupid and I am so mad at him that he stole all his stories from other wizards adventures. He's a coward!<br />-I would not like to go to a school full of petrified people getting attacked and killed. But it's worth it if your going to Hogwarts and that Harry Potter is there to save the day :P<br />-I love the character Dobby!! But, I'm mad at him from trying to save Harry Potter with the Budger (if we write it like that) or the letters that he stole... I just love when Harry says &#34;Just please don't try to save me again&#34;, but we all know that that won't happen :( I pity Dobby, I think that he's just so cute and deserves to be free (well now he is and I'm glad about it).<br />-I was suspecting Dobby or professor Lockhart all along for the air of Sliterin. I thought that maybe Dobby was helping his master(Lucius) that wants that Harry Potter dies by being killed by Voldemort. ( cause you know, Lucius works for Voldy). But, Dubby was only warning Harry that he might be killed by Voldemort on his second year at Hogwarts.<br />-Well I can't think of anything else that you don't already know so.. ya<br /><br />Goodnight people of the world &#60;3
