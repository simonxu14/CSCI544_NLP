Gorgeous artwork! Very visually stimulating. I got this one for me... Well my family, my daughter will read it when she's older (less than a year currently) but I plan to get 2 more, 1 for each of my sisters families their kiddos are the right age for them. Love this! I truly hope they do all 7 books like this. I want them all! (Even though I already own the originals, lol) a great way to get started into the series for sure for younger ones that need more to look at but are ready for the stories
