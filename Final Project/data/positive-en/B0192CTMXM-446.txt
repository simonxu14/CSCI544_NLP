The creative imagination of Ms. Rowling is still at it's best in this third novel of Harry Potter's young life, and Jim Dale is in a class of his own as narrator!  Harry, Hermione, Ron, Hagred, the Dursleys and all of the  cast at Hogwarts are everything and more than a reader (or listener) should  hope for and getting to know them has been a joy!
