After reading all of Ms. Rowling's books, I have watched her writing style grow as her characters grow.  She may have started writing a childrens book, but she brought the characters and the readers up through the ages.  She never looked down upon her readers, and demands that they keep up.  Children throughout my neighborhood spent the first week that the book was out reading; it was as if the entire world had stopped in order for these children to just read.  It was phenomenal.  The world that J.K. Rowling created is one that children and adults enjoy -- many who don't have a zest for reading, are spell-bound by this collection.  The final installment did not disappoint.  I re-read the books in order to pick up the clues that may have been there that she wrapped up so well in the final book.  To think that this woman was able to tie up every loose string from books one through seven is just amazing.  Now that is writing at its best!
