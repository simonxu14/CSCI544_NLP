I'm a 9 year old and just finished the book in 3 days.  It was really good and I couldn't put it down.  It's rather scary in some parts.  In this book, Harry accidentally gets entered into a tri-wizard tournament.  He is  supposed to be too young but was entered anyway.  He faces three tasks that  are very challenging and deadly.  I won't tell you what happens but be sure  to know that Harry survives to star in the 5th book!
