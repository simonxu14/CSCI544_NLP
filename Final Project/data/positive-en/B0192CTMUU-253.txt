Rowling scores again with the same charm, humor, and magic that delighted readers in the first three books. The excitement and anxiety build throughout the book making it very difficult to put down. I greedily  finished the book in just one day.<br />I appreciate a book that makes me  laugh outloud - but who can help laughing with someone like Dobby the  house-elf around... This is the most enjoyable children's series I have  read (and I have read quite a few). Even at 700+ pages, I wish the book had  been longer. I am already dreading the seventh book's arrival, because I  will miss Harry and his friends.
