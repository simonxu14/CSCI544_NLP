When Amazon.com announced the release date for the book last year, I immediately put my order in. A few months later, I took Amazon up on an offer to get the book to my house on the release date... it was very much worth the extra two dollars!<br /><br />I only had to wait six months between the time I finished "The Goblet of Fire" to when "The Order of the Phoenix" was released, and it was a long enough wait. "Phoenix" is a wonderfully told story that, once again, captures the voice of a now-teenage Harry and his friends. You can almost feel his agony leaping off the pages.<br /><br />While the book still has some light moments (like anything dealing with Fred and George and their 'extendable ears'), this is book is definitely darker and more mature. The cover of the book alone, with its blues and blacks as the only colors, is a clue that this book will be different from the others. Harry has definitely matured from book four and his troubles only multiply in this book.<br /><br />A note of caution: I work for a daycare and know for a fact that many children are starting the series and are able to read right through them now that there are five books to catch up on. No eleven year old child should be reading this book. JK Rowling designed her series so that the children who started reading her books several years ago, would be much older now. This book is designed for young adults and up. It's much too deep and disturbing for younger children.
