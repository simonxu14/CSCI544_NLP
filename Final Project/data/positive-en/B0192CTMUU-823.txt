I just finished reading Book IV and can scarcely wait to crack the cover again. Just a few of the highlights in store: Quidditch World Cup, Triwizard Tournament and a Yule Ball. The ending was terrifying to me (an  adult) but I believe that it set up plenty of plot lines and intrigue for  the remaining three books. My only complaint is that I'll have to wait  another whole year for book number 5!
