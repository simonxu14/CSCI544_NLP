I was dreading whether HP and the Deathly Hallows would have a tragic ending or a "Sopranos" ending...neither happened. The ending was quite satisfying. It really helps to have read the previous 6 volumes of HP as Rowling ties up many loose ends. Yes, volume 7 is THAT good. I didn't think anything would be better than volume 4 (HP and the Goblet of Fire) but volume 7 is at least as good. I feel terrible separation anxiety that it is now all over. At least we have the movie versions of volumes 6 and 7 to see but alas they will not be as good as the books. I'm ready to read it all again and again!
