It is darker,but there is not a single word you would excise in 870 pages. JKR takes us into the heart of a 15-year-old boy as well as the struggle between good and evil. There are terrific set pieces-- studying for finals; Hermoine's rich emotional development; a fairly ghastly first date for Harry; and the death of someone Harry -- and we -- have come to love. Marvel at JKR's texture and brilliance in taking this beloved saga to the next level. I am sure there will be hundreds of reviews here soon, but by all means, read it and revel.
