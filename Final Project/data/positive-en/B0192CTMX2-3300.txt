This book is not for you if you haven't read books 1 through 6. (And I heartily recommend that you DO read them.)<br /><br />All previous books in the series begin with Harry preparing to go to Hogwarts, meeting or reuniting with his friends, uncovering a mystery, and build up to an exciting episode of danger and triumph. The final book has a different beginning and is filled with many episodes of real danger. It is more violent and contains more deaths than Books 5 and 6. Rowling skillfully incorporates a review of happenings and characters in this fast-paced epic. (I appreciated this because so much time elapsed between Book 7 and Book 6.) Character development continues; we see growth in characters as well as surprising revelations about some.<br /><br />It's a wonderful read. I have mixed feelings--satisfied with the "loose ends" being tied up, and sad because it is the end of a fascinating series.
