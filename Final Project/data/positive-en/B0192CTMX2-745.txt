Several things make the Harry Potter books good reads for adults as well as children: they are well written, exciting, thought-provoking, and at times, downright funny. The fifth book in the series is no exception; in fact, it may well be the most rewarding for adult readers yet.  Emotionally and relationally, it is more intense than the earlier titles.  Part of this may be because Harry himself is growing up -- among other things he learns that even dearly loved and trusted grownups  will make mistakes and do wrong things, and that relationships with people of the opposite gender can be confusing and difficult.  While growing up, he begins to see the people around him in a new light. Because of this, the readers get to see other sides of the characters and get to know them better, especially Remus Lupin and Sirius Black, possibly the two most intriguing people involved in Harry's life.  And, like all Harry Potter books, it gives a few good reminders about things that really matter: this time it reminds us that love is the most powerful weapon of all, and there are things worth dying for.
