This is in my opinion the best Harry Potter Book J.K. Rowling has written so far. It was well worth the wait I don't give away the ending of the book but the ending is very scary and it is sort of a cliffhanger ending. You  will also meet alot of new charecters in this book and students from  differant wizarding schools. It was so good it only took two days to  finish. You will not be disapointed with this book.
