I bought this book for my 9 year old as his first “big kid” type of book. He has officially finished reading all of the Captain Underpants and Diary of a Wimpy Kid books so moving forward I wanted him to have something that will challenge him and hold his attention. I was only slightly worried that he would get board since this will be the first book he has read that doesn’t have any comics or doodles throughout the pages to hold interest.<br /><br />Let’s face it, Harry Potter needs no introduction. My book arrived in about half of my estimated shipping time in emasculate condition. My son has been reading it for about a week now and is coming up to the halfway mark. He even woke up extra early before school the other day to get some reading in (proud mama/bookworm moment).<br /><br />Don’t forget to encourage you kids to read.<br /><br />“I have lived a thousand lives and I’ve loved a thousand loves. I’ve walked on distant worlds and seen the end of time. Because I read.” – George R.R. Martin
