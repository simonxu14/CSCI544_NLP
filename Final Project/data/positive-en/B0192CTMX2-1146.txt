This is the last of a great series of audio books on CD, and the narration by Jim Dale continues to make the characters come alive.  What a great way to enjoy the last of the Harry Potter books.  Make's my daily drive time commute fun and interesting.  If you have listened to the other (6) Harry Potter audio books on CD, this last one in the series is a must.  One of the best of the series, Jim Dale's best effort with dozens of voices.
