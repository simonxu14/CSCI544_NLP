Reading a true children's book gives the impression of safety. You know nothing irreversible will happen to the main characters. You do not read it to find out IF they will make everything all right in the end but HOW. This is what I felt reading the first four Harry Potter books, but Order of the Phoenix is different, more dangerous. The actions the characters take have definite consequences, although Rowling softens those consequences somewhat in the end (for me, this was the book's biggest downfall).<br />Still, the story was so intense that all 800 pages were readable in a single night. Harry's emotions have been stirred up fantastically in this book and I ended up feeling many of them along with him. He is now prone to righteous anger and even violent fits of rage, which cause me to wonder if he will not become vulnerable to darkness in upcoming books.<br />The tale of Harry Potter is becoming truly epic. If Rowling continues this trend of adding more tragedy, depth and darkness with each book, by the end of the series the story will be comparable to episodes 4, 5 & 6 of Star Wars.
