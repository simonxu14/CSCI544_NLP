This is the most beautiful book I have ever owned.  Magical illustrations to go along with an equally magical story.<br />There are other reviews that describe this book in great technical detail so I'll let you read those for the nitty gritty.  My review is to let you know how special this book is.<br /> This is the book you'll want to read a little of each night to your children before bed...<br /> It's the book your kids will pull out on a rainy day to thumb through and it will take them back to the magic of the very first time they read it....<br />It's the book that they'll turn to when they're feeling like they're weird and don't belong.  Then they'll read this- I am what I am, an’ I’m not ashamed. 'Never be ashamed,’ my ol’ dad used ter say, ‘there’s some who’ll hold it against you, but they’re not worth botherin’ with&quot;.  These words will feel like a hug at a time that they might think they're too old for hugs.<br />It's the book that they'll bring out when they're home from college over the holidays.  The memories of their childhood will come back to them with each turn of the page...<br />It's the book they'll ask about when they're expecting their first child and you will happily give them their own copy that you have been saving for them for especially that moment.  And your child will look at you and say, &quot;after all this time?&quot;  And you will reply, &quot;always.&quot;...<br />This is the book that you will hear your child read to their own children at bedtime and you will silently wonder with tears in your eyes &quot;where has the time gone?&quot;<br /><br />We will treasure this book and all of the memories it gives us.
