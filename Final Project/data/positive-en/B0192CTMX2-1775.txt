This, as with the previous Potter books is a wonderful work of literary art.  It'a a great adventure that even those who find themselves "book-challenged" will enjoy.  Bookworms, on the other hand will find Rowling has the writing talent of the greats before her.  Her use of literary tools and imagery, her attention to character development and adhereance to her self-created wizard mythology is amazing.<br /><br />Reading Harry Potter and becoming engrossed in Rowling's world as I have been, I find myself going to revist other favorite fiction works, like the Narnia series, Lord of the Rings, Once and Future King, etc.  I hope that young readers,encouraged by their love of Harry Potter will be inspired to read other great literature too.<br /><br />Hats off once again to Ms. Rowling on yet another wonderful Harry tale!
