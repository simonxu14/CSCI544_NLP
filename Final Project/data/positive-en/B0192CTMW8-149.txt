You don't have to be a kid to get into the Harry Potter craze.  After reading the first two of the series, I'm likely to read the rest.  Rowling  captures the concerns of children and adults everywhere-the desire to be  wanted and accepted, to feel safe, to be appreciated, have good friends, to  learn and have adventures.  The characters are distinct, memorable, and  charming in original ways.  I love the all-flavor beans, the Quidditch  matches, Dobby's self-punishing behavior, and polyjuice potion.  Very  entertaining.  A nice change from what I usually read. ~Joan Mazza, author  of DREAM BACK YOUR LIFE and DREAMING YOUR REAL SELF
