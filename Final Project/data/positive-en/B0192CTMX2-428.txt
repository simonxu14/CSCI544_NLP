Jim Dale's inspired reading of the entire Harry Potter series is a treat.  He manages to convey the different voices for all the characters convincingly and with great feeling, and fans of all ages of the novels will not be disappointed. They are perfect for long car trips.  The packaging is very attractive with Mary GrandPre's illustrations on the boxes and fold-out covers.
