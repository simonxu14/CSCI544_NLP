I am a big Harry Potter fan and own several sets of the books, but the UK adult edition is absolutely my favorite.  The covers are gorgeous and I am so happy that I picked up the whole set.  I had every book in the set except this one and I had regretted not purchasing it and I was so happy that I did because I love having the complete set.
