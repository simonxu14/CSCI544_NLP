I started reading Harry Potter books because my daughter wanted to read them. After seeing the movies, I wondered if these books were too scary or too adult for my 8 year old. I was also out of a fresh supply of books to read, but I was not exactly thrilled to be reading Harry Potter. Boy, was I wrong! I read all 7 books as fast as work and family would possibly allow. I bought Deathly Hallows online because my local book store did not have it, and I needed it NOW. While this last book is not my favorite in the magnificent series of stories, I had to know what happened to the characters. Predictable, but a page-turner. If there is another mom out there who has yet to read what your kids are reading: you are missing out!<br /><br /><a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Harry-Potter-Paperback-Box-Set-Books-1-7/dp/0545162076/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Harry Potter Paperback Box Set (Books 1-7)</a>
