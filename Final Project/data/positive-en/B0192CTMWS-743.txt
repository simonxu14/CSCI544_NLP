With this fifth installment Rowling has reached for more emptional depth as the characters mature. There is a real feal of teen age emotional conflict and confusion, however she tends to belabor the point and the plot sometimes suffers. There is also a lack of depth in a few of the characters. The emotional content that she stresses somtimes seems totally absent from her plot development with some events feeling abupt, which she tends to "clean up" later with a few, very few, words. The ending seems a bit contrived but it does explain the focus of the book.<br />Harry again is forced to face his nemesis and this time he feels alone, even though he has recruited a cadre of friends to help.<br />All in all a good read and the familiar characters, settings and themes feel like a return home to readers. The plot and themes may unfortunetly be a bit too advanced for a good portion of younger readers, but it is not as scary as the last two for them. Alone this is a fair to good book, as part of the series it is very enjoyable. This one will make a very good movie, probably a better movie than a book.
