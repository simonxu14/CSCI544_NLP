I bought this from Amazon less than a month after the book came out, so I thought it would be hard to find at a decently discouted price.  I was very pleased to find it listed as new at such a price, and when it arrived, it was still in the shrink-wrap and everything.  Same exact thing I could have bought at Barnes and Noble or even Ebay for 70+ dollars, but for like $20 less.
