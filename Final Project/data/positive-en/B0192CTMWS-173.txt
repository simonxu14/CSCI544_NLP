I am a veteran of several trips through the Harry Potter saga, and each time I enter the world of witches and wizards I am amazed at Rowling's wizardry in creating this rich, and exciting tale of a boy and his friends' adventures and maturing. If escapism is your goal, the Harry Potter series is a great choice. What I appreciated about the Deathly Hallows is the confident plotting. The story flows, and the sins and omissions of the characters are rewarded and punished. I like the series -- a lot. If there is anything annoying about Harry Potter is his sheer dumb luck. Very few literary characters have managed to squeeze out victory against overwhelming odds.<br /><br />By all means, buy the series for your Kindle and have a wonderful world waiting for you whenever you need it.
