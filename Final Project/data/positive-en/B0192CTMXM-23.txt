No one is reading a review of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix if they aren't already in love with the Harry Potter series. Me, I started with the movies, and only read the books later, with my son. The Harry Potter books were the first books he actually wanted to read. They're way too hard for him, with lots of long words, frustratingly used as gerunds and adverbs all the time just to make them longer.<br /><br />J.K. Rowling is not a particularly great wordsmith. She's too wordy. Some of her sentences are too convoluted. She's only average at descriptions. In Order of the Phoenix, Rowling is finally hitting her stride as a writer. It's much smoother than her earlier books.<br /><br />Rowling has obviously read a lot about magic. Her magic has a sense of whimsy that contrasts with the dark battle between Harry and Voldemort. She's also clearly been imagining this magical world since she was five, and it has great depth and breadth, kind of like Tolkein's world. Harry finally gets the girl in Phoenix, and Rowling writes these passages with wonderful empathy and understanding that might help teenage readers understand (or at least relate to) their own first loves.<br /><br />There's a lot of action swirling around in Phoenix. The book makes it more understandable than the movie did (duh). It's been very good reding in 30-45 minute chunks, passing the book back and forth to my 11-year-old. Partway through, my wife started asking us to read with her too. Yay, books for the win!
