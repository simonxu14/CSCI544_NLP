This book is absolutely gorgeous! Jim Kay did an amazing job with this book. As I flipped the pages I became more and more drawn into this amazing art. The style is great and fits well with the energy of the book. The double page illustration of the burrow was one of my favorites and brought all sorts of emotions back just looking at it. This was a great addition to my book shelf and I hope the rest of them get illustrated so I can have a full set of these. Hands down the best purchase I've made all year
