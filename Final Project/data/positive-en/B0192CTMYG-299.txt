Okay, so I have to admit two things: one, I'm fast approaching 40 and  don't have any children; two, I read this book just to see what all the  fuss was about; three, I loved it.<br /><br />I'd heard of Harry Potter of  course, but didn't think much of it until all the fuss over the fourth  book. People I work with began telling me I should read it and they were  right.  The book reminded me of the works of Roald Dahl.  I don't think  small children should read it alone, but that makes it perfect for reading  together.  I really enjoyed the interplay of the three main characters - I  thought it was cool that they were at once simple enough for children to  understand and complex enough for adults to find interesting  too.<br /><br />There are plenty of reviews which divulge part of the story, so  I won't waste your time with a plot synopsis other than to say that I  watched Silence of the Lambs with very few surprises, guessed the secret of  Sixth Sense fifteen minutes into the movie, and got surprised by the ending  of this book.  I really enjoyed this book and I can't wait to get the next  three (two of which are currently on back-order - hazards of being a  bandwagon fan I guess).
