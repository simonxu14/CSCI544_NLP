Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is my favorite book of the series.  It contains more mysteries, hightened emotions, more complex relationships - everything you would expect a 15 year old boy to be going through, and more.  I was riveted to every page and read the entire book in two days.  I wanted to launch straight into book 6.  I just hope I don't have to wait another 2 or 3 years for it!
