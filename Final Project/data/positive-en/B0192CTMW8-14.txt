All you Potter fans will relate when I say that I'm having as much fun as my 7 year old when I read this to her.<br />This is my daughter's first novel series. she's completely hooked, of course. She is a bit on the sensitive side, so before we started reading it to her (age 6 when we started), we explained there were going to be some scary parts, but that Harry would be ok. That helped a lot, as she hasn't complained about it being too scary.  After finishing a book, we let her watch the movie version.
