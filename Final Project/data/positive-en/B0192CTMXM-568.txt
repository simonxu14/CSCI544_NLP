This book truly is the most powerful in the series thus far. It is a much darker book from the opening page to the closing page however this did not dissuade me from reading through it quickly. This is one of the first books in the series that does not really stand alone which I personally enjoyed. I have always found it bothersome when authors fill the first few chapters with nothing but back story that we've already read. This is one of the few books in the series that the action really does start in the opening chapter and continues throughout the book.<br />This book is filled with information and surprises along with some things that did not surprise me at all. Voldemort is back in full power. The ministry of magic is doing everything in their power to keep from admitting to the possibility of his return. The Order of the Phoenix is out to stop his return and having to fight against the ministries paranoia the entire way. Professor Umbridge was a nice addition to the book. She truly was the character that you will despise completely and still keep reading just to find out how she's going to make you hate her even more. Harry is growing up quickly and has become very moody and on the verge of breaking under the pressure of everything he has gone through up to this point. Let's face it any kid who has nearly died that many times and faced as much as he has along with having someone that the entire world fears out to kill you and still the adults in the world will not tell you anything would be a bit moody as well.<br />Over all I would highly recommend this book to anyone. My one suggestion though is that you should really read the first four books before picking this one up.
