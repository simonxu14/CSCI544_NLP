Fabulously Illustrated! I can't say enough about this edition of Harry Potter. The pages are glossy and of wonderful quality. I was not expecting to find as many illustrations as I did. I would say that there is one every three pages. If you love Harry Potter or want to read it for the first time, this has just become the definitive edition.
