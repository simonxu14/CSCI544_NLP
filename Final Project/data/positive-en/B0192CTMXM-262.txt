First of all, I encourage all Harry Potter readers to read these books in order.  If you do, things will make more sense, you'll understand more about the entire situation, and each books builds upon the previous book.<br />In this book, Harry again has many hilarious adventures at Hogwarts.  However, in this book (as well as the 4th book), Harry comes face to face with deeper issues than merely learning magic from some truly eccentric characters.  Harry is forced to relive the past - a past that he has possibly blocked because of the pain involved or something he was just too young to remember: his parents' death and receiving his scar.<br />In this book, Harry is forced to explore some details of his past - which is necessary for him to understand more about his life and even his future as a wizard.  Each of these trials are preparing him for something that only J.K. Rowlings knows.<br />This book is considerably longer than the previous two books (but, definitely not as long as Book 4).  However, I believe that all readers will become quickly involved in this book, and they will wish it could be even longer!  Each time I have read this book, I have discovered little tidbits of information that I missed the time before.  That only make my reading so enjoyable; I'm able to understand more, and I'm able to see more about the complexity and thoroughness that Rowlings has put into this book.<br />I recommend this book to all readers, young and old.  I believe that everybody will enjoy this book.  This book has the simplicity to involve younger audiences, but it also has the complexity to connect with older readers as well.
