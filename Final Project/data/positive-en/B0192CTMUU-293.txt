I received my book at 11 a.m. on 7/8...I finished it at 1 a.m. on Sunday.  This book IS darker than the first three but I found myself laughing out loud several times and on the verge of tears at others.  I loved the new  characters and enjoyed getting back with my old friends.  Once again J.K.  Rowling kept me on the edge of my seat with her easy to read style and  great sense of mystery and adventure.  Now I will find it hard to wait for  Volume V!
