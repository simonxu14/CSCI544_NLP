This series of audiobooks has opened a whole new genre for me.  The narration is the best I have heard so far.  I almost didn't continue the series after the second book, but the audiobooks rekindled my interest with the series and I went back and started the series over in audiobook form.  The book itself finishes the series well but leaves you wanting more.  The series has had its ups and downs, but this book is defintely one of the better ones.  I like the audiobooks much better than the movies.  Even though the movies have stayed true to the books, the audiobooks tell the whole story.  I will probably listen to it again and that has happened with me only with the Half Blood Prince.
