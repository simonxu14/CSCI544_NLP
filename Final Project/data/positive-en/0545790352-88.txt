I love the Harry Potter series and this book truly delivers them in a wonderful new way. The pictures are beautifully detailed and really bring certain scenes to life. As an American I also really love that the book is the British edition. Until I read the original dialogue I had no idea that spell-o-tape is a play on words from &#34;Sellotape&#34; (Britain's version of scotch tape). Looking forward to having the whole collection eventually and reading them all to my sons. If you're a Harry Potter fan I highly recommend getting these books!
