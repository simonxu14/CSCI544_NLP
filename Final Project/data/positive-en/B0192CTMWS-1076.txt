Well everyone knows the Harry Potter books are wonderful so I won't go on about that, but this is the first disk set I purchased (I usually buy audiotapes), it is wonderful! Don't look too closely at the drawings on each CD set though, spoilers everywhere!<br /><br />I have never actually read the books and have only had Jim Dale read them to me, it has been the most amazing way to be a part of this world. He does all the voices and personalities and inflections, he an exceptional storyteller sharing an exceptional story!
