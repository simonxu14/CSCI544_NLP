My 9yo son is now fully prepared for life in our coven...<br />I hope nobody took that seriously.<br />A bit formulaic (hence only 4 stars) but otherwise fabulous.  I don't think that this book was 'darker' than, say,  Azkaban...<br />&lt;'Chamber of Secrets' and 'Prisoner of Azkaban'  spoilers  ahead&gt;<br />I mean, Harry almost gets his soul sucked out by a dementor in  that book!  Here he just almost gets killed.<br />&lt;end spoiler&gt;<br />I  agree with most of the other superlatives tossed about here, and I would  like to add a thought directed at the people who think this book is evil:  while childrens' thoughts are influenced by what they read and by what they  see, the primary influence is how _you_ act.  You should only fear this  book if you fear the example you are setting for your own children.  Don't  try to dictate what my children can read--that's my wife's and my job.
