This I have to say is one of the best books on the planet.  Rowling writes as though you are there in the very same room as the characters.  The action parts are flawless along with the so many other genres of the story;  romance, humor, and horror.  The reason why I gave this book four starts instead of five is because I felt that there could have been a bigger bang in the end (but that could just be me because I have become a very fast reader compared to when I read HBP- so maybe I just read it too fast).  But either way you will NOT regret reading this book.
