The fourth installment of Harry Potter is not only twice as long as any of its predecessors, it also strays somewhat from her established formula.  It is still plot driven, but because the plot is much more complicated and the  number of characters has increased, I can see why some people may be put  off initially.  But be assured that Rowling knows what she is doing.  It's  wonderfully entertaining, and at the same time, provides more emotional  fullfillment than her earlier books.  The only drawback of reading this  book so quickly is that it will be that much longer until the next one.
