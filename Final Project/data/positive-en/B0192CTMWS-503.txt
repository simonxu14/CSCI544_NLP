As with the rest of Harry Potter's fans I waited for this last book to come out; looking forward to it and yet dreading it since it was to be the last.  Rowling worked her magic and it was a page turner to say the least.  I loved it!  But still wished she has kept on on writing more of the series for at least the next 10 years.  As with the first 6 books, I have read this one from cover to cover many times.
