i don't know how the book was, we purchased it for our nephew. we found out he was coming to visit four days before his arrival. we knew he did not have the book ordered so we tried to buy it locally but our local "big bookstore" told us it was too late to pre order so we could come in on the day the book was available and wait in line. we went on line and placed the order with amazon and on the day of release the book was delivered to our door making a young boy very happy.as usual a great job by amazon.com.... thank you!!!!
