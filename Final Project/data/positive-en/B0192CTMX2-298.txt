When a book binds you to your young step-son, it is a healing book and it's "magical".<br /><br />From the very first Harry Potter that I tricked my step-son Thomas into reading, to this, the very last, we've had one thing to look forward to that we did together, that we both enjoyed and that no one else did with us.<br /><br />In today's reality, we have families with all manner of complicated relationships and potentially volatile emotional situations.  This book, and all that came before, have the power to provide inspiration, hope and healing; for some, even magic.<br /><br />When Thomas was a little boy and told me that he was 'magic'--that he'd been born 'magic'--I agreed with him.  Each book in the Harry Potter series has been magic for us:  for the simple but touching stories of hope and wonderful possibilities even in the worst of situations, for the anticipation that Thomas and I have enjoyed with each new release, for the power to interest a young boy in reading and for the 'magic' in created in a blossoming relationship between a young boy and his step-mother.<br /><br />Thanks, J.K.
