Just read this for the second time and it's still highly entertaining. Ms. Rowling has a gift for creating fun characters and a story that draws you along effortlessly. Why four stars instead of five? Because none of the Potter books are great literature, but they deserve their success because they are fun literature--kind of like going to see a popcorn movie. My highest praise is that they are enjoyable for young and old alike, and that is a huge accomplishment. Kudos, Ms. Rowling.
