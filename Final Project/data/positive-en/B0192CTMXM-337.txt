I can't believe it's finally ended.  I was curious as to how she would weave the story together and tie up all the loose ends.  I'm nearly 60 years old and I loved every sentence of the book.  Like a fable there are lessons to be learned about life, love, true friends, fighting for an idea or cause, sacraficing for your friends, and so many others too numerous to mention here.  This is surely a story that every parent will have to read to their children at bed time for all future generations to come.  Harry Potter is a hero, and will be the model we would all want our kids to follow.  I'd like to believe that Harry Potter lives in all of us.  How can J.K. Rowling create another story that tops this? Thank you J.K. for writing such a wonderful story.
