Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a delightful, terrifying, funny, painful, sad and gripping read.  I have long been a fan of the Potter series and have awaited this volume with a battling mixture of excitement and sadness.  This book is every bit as good as each of the previous volumes.  It is possibly the best in the series.  In spite of all the speculation and prediction among fans, the ending is full of surprises. J. K. Rowling has outdone herself in this book.  I higly recommend this book to all Harry Potter fans, but readers should not approach this book if they have not read all six of the other Harry Potter books.  Excellent!
