Amazing! Beautiful! Gorgeous! I was buying this for my nephew and of course couldn't resist reading it. Now I must order a second copy. It's that good.<br />Eye friendly print. Lovely illustrations that really match the story and have the magical element the printed editions contain. There is magic In every volume.<br />I have found my book(sorry kid) to be very well bound. The jacket paper is of a good quality. I also found the inner pages to be thick enough they won't tear while reading.<br />I'm in love. This edition has earned it place on my Harry Potter shelf. I look forward to the next illustrated  book!!
