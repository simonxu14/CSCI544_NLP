I am a huge Harry Potter fan. I have read every book (including the school books) more times then I can count and watched every movie again and again... I purchased this in hopes of inspiring my little ones to read and to spend some valuable bonding time at bedtime. I must say this is perfect! Almost every page has a beautiful illustration and truly brings the story to life. My two year old loves laying in bed with mommy while I read this to her! She points at the pictures and we &#34;talk&#34; about the characters. I highly recommend  this to all Potter fans! Esp. those of us with little children who want to share J.K Rowlings amazing world with our little loves. :)
