Overall a very good ending to the series. I do have a couple complaints with the book.<br /><br />First, it needed one more chapter, to jump 19 years and not explain what happend in between, especially how order returned to the wizardly world left a lot of loose ends. Who lived, who died, did they return to school to graduate, what happened to the mistreated Half-bloods and who rounded up all the dementors?<br /><br />Second, some of the deaths happen "off camera", maybe she did this to lessen them, but after investing in these characters all these years, it almost feels like they were killed just for the shock value alone.<br /><br />I know the book is written from Harry's point of view and there is obviously a lot going on he doesn't know about, but you are left wondering how wizards in other countries are responding to Voldemort and the Death Eaters, why Hogwarts was not better prepared for a seige and I can't help wondering what everyone else is doing while Harry is having his adventures.
