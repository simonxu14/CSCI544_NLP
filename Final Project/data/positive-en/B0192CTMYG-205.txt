I would have to stand in a very long line to make my review of this book heard. How can you improve on a classic work of pure genius? I will never forget how my first sight of the boats approaching Hogwarts in the movie was so exactly like my image of it in the book, that it worked a little magic of its own. We all want to believe in magic and in the underdog who becomes the hero. This is not just 'the boy who lived.' This is the book that lived.
