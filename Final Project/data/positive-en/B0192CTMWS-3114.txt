Since there are over 3,000 reviews on this book, I'll keep mine real short. I have read all of Rawlings' books and this one is just as good as the others. However, this book starts off on a darker tone than the others did ~~ Harry Potter is now 15 and is moody as most teenage boys that age are. But he still retains his sweetness and intergrity amidst all of the confusion that is happening at the Ministry of Magic and at Hogswart.<br />This is an excellent follow-up to the other four books in the series ~~ and as usual, leaves you hungering for more of Harry Potter. I highly recommend this book to all adults and children ~~ there is nothing like a classic entertaining book about good vs. evil. This book is it...
