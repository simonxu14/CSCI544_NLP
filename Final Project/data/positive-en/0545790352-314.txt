My children and I really love this illustrated version of the Harry Potter books.  Not all of the pages have complete pictures, but the majority of them do.  I read a chapter a night to my 4, 5, and 8 year olds and they can pay attention a lot better than when I tried to read the chapter books to them.  We can't wait until the other books come out!
