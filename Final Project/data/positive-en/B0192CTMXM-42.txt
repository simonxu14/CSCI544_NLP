Book 3 is my favorite in the series. It is very easy to forget that you are reading fantasy and find yourself joining the adventure. Couldn't put it down. This series is full of imagination, making the impossible possible! It teaches us a lesson about honor and contempt, love and loss, right and wrong. No words can be used to express its excellence. After reading this, it suddenly occurs to me that life is full of various choice, such as, being enthusiastic with amazing ambitions or just being ordinary without nothing to pursue for. The answer is definitely the former one. Satisfy to the book！！Enjoy the magic content book！
