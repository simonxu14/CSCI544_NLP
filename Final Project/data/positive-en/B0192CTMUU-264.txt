Ok, so i might be over 9 and going on 14, but i still love thisbook, and i think that you people should buy it, i read all 734 pagesin one day becuase i was so hooked on the amazing story line. i think i must have laughed out loud more than 11 times becuas of the histerical things that some of the people say in the book, once or twice toward the end i cried(who wouldn't) and i am really bothered that i don't know the next date for the publishing of the 5th book... the person who i thank the most at this moment is j.k.rowling for creating this lovely fantasy for me!
