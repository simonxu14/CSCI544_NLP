I just finished the Goblet of Fire and I am still trying to process all that has happened. It was a mystery within mysteries. Harry Potter once again displays his courage and bravery. Unlike the past books this one leaves the ending a sad and unpleasent. It was different in that aspect and many others. The books keep getting better and better. I recommend this book highly. Once I was at Chapter 20 I could not stop reading until I had finished the book.
