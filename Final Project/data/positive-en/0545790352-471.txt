Though I already own 2 sets of HP books, I had to pre-order this one and couldn't have been happier when it arrived. It's absolutely gorgeous, the illustrations are incredible, and it's just awesome to see JK Rowling story depicted in drawings. I can't wait to give this to my 7 year old boy, it's the number one slot on his Xmas wish list.
