Buy it! The illustrations are lovely. I purchased a copy for myself and one for my sister. She got the wrapping halfway off on Christmas morning and said &#34;is this what I think it is?!&#34; The book is spectacular and as children who grew up reading Harry Potter it is nice to have a new, illustraed, version to share now that we are beginning families of our own.
