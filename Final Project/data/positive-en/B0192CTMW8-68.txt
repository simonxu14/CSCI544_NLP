Wonderful terrific book as are all of them in the 7 book collection by Rowling.  Again it was ordered as a birthday present for one of the family children and he was mesmerized by it.  We all were, once he finally let the rest of us read it. &#34;Grampy&#34; actually got to read it secondly, right after this child did.  We were all so grateful to have this as well as Book 1 and Book 2 that Grampy could read.  He was elderly and knowingly at the end of his life during those 3 years.  It was so amazing to have these books to share and talk about together.  Grampy was fascinated to say the least and he especially loved being able to speak with the children about it afterward, all of them equally excited over every chapter and discussing it together.<br />A truest blessing for all of them together and the most perfect time that could be. Thank you, God!
