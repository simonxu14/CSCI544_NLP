At long last, the fifth book has made its way, page by page, past my eager little eyeballs. I liked it. I would have been very surprised not to have liked it, to be fair, but even so.<br />One thing that I think Rowling has done well is to avoid making Harry into some sort of perfect Golden Boy. He makes mistakes. He has character flaws. In book 5 he has turned into quite the grumpy, moody adolescent, in fact. The "bad guys" are still almost uniformly evil, though, which I think could be softened a touch. They could be a bit more three dimensional.<br />Regardless, the book was full of action and sub-plots and was a very fun read. We do learn a lot more about the backstory in this one, which is nice. We see a lot more of Dumbledore as well, which is fun.
