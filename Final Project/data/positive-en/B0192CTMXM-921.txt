I was really satisfied with the ending. I was really praying that JK Rowling will not kill Harry Potter in the end. I was amazed at how the author really linked every single event from the very first book to the last, giving the readers utmost satisfaction.. like why Harry, having the eyes of his mother being important in the story, how Wormtail was affected by Harry saving his life in the third book, etc, etc. This  last book is really full of interesting bits that I hope this will not be shortened in the film. I hope the film makers would divide this book into two chapters so as not to loose the important events that will make the story complete and satisfying to the movie goers who did not read the book. I would like them to be as satisfied as we readers do.
