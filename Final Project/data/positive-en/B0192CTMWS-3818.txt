Wow.  J.K. Rowling has outdone herself yet again in The Order of the Phoenix.  Yes, Harry is frequently angry, sometimes a bit of a snot, and even disagreeable - but Harry is also 15.  Reading the experiences of Harry vividly brought back memories of my own adolescence (and how uncomfortable and generally painful the experience was.)  Bravo for her her honesty as she lets young Potter "grow up" facing troubles typical of a 15 year old - teachers who are unfair, the challenges of figuring out the oppsite sex, alienation and frustration with adults, and impatience with friends.  Of course, there are also other things bothering our young hero ...<br />The story involves the increasing frequency with which Harry's scar hurts, his troubling dreams (from the perspective of "You-Know-Who") and, as if this was not enough, the fact that he is living under the microscope of the press.<br />As many other reviewers have said, the book reads quickly, in spite of its size.  The story is that engrossing.  Highly recommended.
