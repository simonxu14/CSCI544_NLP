They said this book was for children, but the hoop-la was so fantastic I just couldn't resist.  Since I have no children to read it to and all my friends got to read it with their children, I have to say I felt left out.  Who was this Harry Potter? Everyone I know was talking about young Master  Harry, and there I sat - uneducated - overaged.  So, throwing caution to  the wind, I read my first book this weekend and I'm buying the second book  today.  Who said children had to be aged 9 - 13?  This is some of the best  reading I've done in years.  The writing slides across your mind forging  images that no movie director will be able to recreate.  This Harry Potter  series is sheer genius. I love it!
