I have been waiting YEARS for this book to come out!  I did nothing but read from the moment it came until I finished it, and I must say it was indeed a great book.  The thing I love about the harry potter books, is that you can read and read and read for hundreds of pages and not get sick of it.  The only thing I was slightly disappointed in was the afterword-it was a little too "happily ever after" for me....it could have ended in dumbledore's office and left me the happiest reader in the world.<br /><br />One more quick aspect, I love taking books and relating them to christian history.  Harry Potter is definitely one of the best comparisons I have been able to make.  This book is right up there with the Narnia series and LOTR.
