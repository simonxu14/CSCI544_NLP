Perfect addition to my collection. I've read and watched the stories a hundred times over so i am definitely a HUGE fan. I purchased this on a Thursday night, it arrived on Friday early afternoon. Right in time for SVComic con on Saturday and i was able to get Bonnie Wright (Ginny Weasley) to sign it!! Much thinner than the other books not really what i expected but then again i'm used to the paperbacks. Excellent Read!!
