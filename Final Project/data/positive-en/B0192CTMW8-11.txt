Loved this book, in the series is the second year of Harry's at Hogwarts. Harry has problems with a house elf who causes he and Ron are sealed out of  platform 9 3/4. They take Ron's dad Flying Ford Anglia back to Hogwarts. This leads to much trouble for them plus the other trouble as the semester at Hogwarts moves along. The characters are very well defined, and as the story unfolds more and more terror as people are petrified and Harry is accused of being the heir of Slytherin. Ron,  and Hermione and Harry try to solve the mystery. But, then Hermione is petrified, he and Ron have to go it alone. I really enjoyed the story. It is an excellent book. I'd recommend it as a read for anyone. I've read this book twice and watched the movie based  on the book many times. I still enjoy it.
