Received on Sat as promised, finished it on Sunday and have begun reading it again. I was a bit worried about the frequent use of "God" in the beginning, but by the end no mention... thank goodness! Got a bit too religious for me early on. However, I was very happy with the use of characters. My one regret is that it didn't have an extra hundred pages or so to follow up on all of them 19-years on... still, a great read and a very fitting last book of a series.
