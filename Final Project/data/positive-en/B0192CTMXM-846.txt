To be honest, I wasn't one of the first people to jump on the Harry Potter bandwagon.  In fact, I avoided the series up until recently considering it to be nothing more than a fad.  However, after reading the first novels in the series this past winter I became hooked, and to my surprise the series only gets better with time.  The Order of the Phoenix, though much darker than previous books, is an excellent read.  It not only rewards fans of the previous books by making reference to previous materials, it also builds off subplots and ideas from previous books.  In fact, after reading the series you'll become intwined with every subplot wondering what twist or turn will come up next.  LIkewise this book also brings an entire new view to the series with a slight twist near end involving Harry and Neville.  The only bad part is having to wait for the next portion of the saga to be released.
