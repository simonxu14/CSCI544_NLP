I don't typically write reviews for products, but this book is just so much better than I expected, and I had high expectations. The artwork is breathtaking and the quality of the printing is amazing. There are significantly more illustrations than I expected, some taking up full pages while others are included on pages with text.  This book is the perfect way to introduce new readers to the series.  I cannot wait to share it with my six year old.
