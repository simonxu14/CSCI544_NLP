The Harry Potter series is brilliant. Perhaps the people who didn't like the ending should remember that they are reading children's books? I only wish we could see goodness overcome evil and corruption in the real world...<br /><br />The story was totally captivating - I didn't sleep until I finished every page! Not much else to say as I think the books speak for themselves.
