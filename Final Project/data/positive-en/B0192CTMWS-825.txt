I anxiously awaited this book release, along with everyone else, and it was well worth the wait. I couldn't put it down, especially after I got to the halfway mark. Rowling outdid herself with this book.  Although it did start a little slow, it picked up quickly and kept my interest. It was great to see Harry growing into a teenager, the feelings that go along with that - from anger and frustration about changes at Hogwarts, to the butterflies in his stomach when he sees the girl he likes. I thought the climax scene towards the end was written a little haphazardly, but was good nonetheless. Harry is faced with losing someone close to him, and I felt his emotions during this part. But it is a part of growing up.  When Harry learns what Dumbledore should have told him 5 years ago, things finally seem to make some sense to him, and the reader. Of course, this whole book is just a set up for book #6, which I am now anxiously awaiting!
