This book is so stunning! I was very delighted to see that it came with great packaging. I was reading some other reviews and someone said that because of poor packaging, their book was damaged. Luckily, they must have listened because my book came wrapped in tight plastic with a thick piece of cardboard covering the cover. I have ordered books from Amazon before and the book jackets have been slightly bent, but not this one! Very impressed :) What can I say about the illustrations?? They are impeccable. I am in awe over this book; everything about it is perfect. I have been a fan of the Harry Potter series for a while and this puts the icing on the cake. Every page is beautifully decorated and some pages are full of illustrations while some are lightly illustrated. No matter what, every page is sure to surprise you. Would I recommend this book? Yes! I love it and can't wait to read...
