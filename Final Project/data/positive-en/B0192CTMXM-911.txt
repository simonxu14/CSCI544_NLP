Perhaps it is case of over-exposure but I was a little disappointed in this book, which ends such an extremely popular series.  The plot, at times, seemed rushed - as if Rowling had more to say but not enough time to say it.  Moreover, for anyone who reads a look of fantasy, the storyline seems pretty familiar and one of the things I had thought the Harry Potter books did well was stay away from that typicality.  All in all, it was still a good read and a "must" for anyone that has been keeping up with the series.  The Harry Potter series is cleary wrapped but it seemed to me that Rowling left herself an opening for a new series in this same wizarding world but with someone other than Harry Potter as the lead.  It'll be interesting to see if she returns to it in the future.
