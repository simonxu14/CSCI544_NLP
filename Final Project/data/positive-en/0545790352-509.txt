This book is beautiful! I purchased it as a Christmas gift for my kids who are 6 and 4. I know they're a little young for it, however I can begin reading it to them and engage them with the gorgeous illustrations. My oldest reads like a 9 year old so I know I made the right purchase. Plus, Barnes and Noble sells it for 39.99. Buy it!
