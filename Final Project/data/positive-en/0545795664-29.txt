To be honest, I did not not purchase this book for me but rather one of my kids, so I am basing this review off of their feedback to me.  We initially saw this book at the school book fair but after checking it on Amazon we discovered it was much cheaper here (even more so than the kick back the school would get.)  As such we ordered it up (kids love getting packages in their name) and they went to work with it.  Given their love of Pokemon Go these days, this plays right into that love and they are using it quite heavily.
