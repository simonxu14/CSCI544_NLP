As an avid fan of HP, I jumped into this final offering. It was engaging, well-written, and ... predictable (for which, I must admit, I was glad). Rowling has such a wonderful imagination and we can all be glad she chose to explore/expand her concept and vision of Harry and his milieu to all us muggles. A really great series that warrants reading again. Still, Tolkien remains the best of the best of the genre.
