Harry clearly showed his immaturity by wanting in on everything that was going on and not getting along with Snape and getting kicked out of his Occlumancy lessons. He was told to go back and ask Snape if he could return and by not doing so it ended up getting his uncle killed, because of his then inability to keep Voldemart out.
