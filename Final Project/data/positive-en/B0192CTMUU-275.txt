Another great installment of the Harry Potter series.  I felt that the pre-publication hype prepared us for the death of someone far more central to the series and, frankly, I felt a more than a little manipulated on that  point.  But, overall, the book delivers.  The plot elements that make this  series so wonderful were all in evidence--great characters the reader  really cares about, imaginative situations, a suspenseful ending and more  clues to the mystery of Potter's past.  What's the publication date for  book 5?  I can't wait!
