I needed this book to complete my Harry Potter collection.  It will be there for me to re-read and for my kids to enjoy.  I am a believer in books....real books.  They can be read under the covers by flashlight with no batteries or electric connections.  They can be read on a camping trip or on a rainy day in a quiet corner....anywhere there is light and a reader with a little time to enjoy them.  Books are a delight to the soul.
