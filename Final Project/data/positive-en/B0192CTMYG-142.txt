I love the Harry Potter movies and expected no less from them books. I just love reading the parts that they have left out in the movies, and the best part is, there were not that many!! The book is so entertaining and has great word choice and helps<br />me further imagine Hogwarts for myself- I loved the book. I also think the books are funnier and I enjoyed laughing at some parts of this. I'm extremely excited to read the rest of the series.
