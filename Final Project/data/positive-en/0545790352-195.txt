What a lovely book! I ordered the illustrated edition of the first Harry Potter book for my niece's 8th birthday, and I almost kept it for myself! The illustrations are beautiful, and closely follow the descriptions from the book as opposed to the movies. I remember reading the Harry Potter series when I was a kid, and the illustrations really bring back some of the images I'd conjured up in my imagination (oh, what a number of fanart I made)!<br /><br />The pages also have a nice weight and feel to them which makes me believe they will handle well at the hands of an eight-year-old. In fact, it feels as though it would last through many years. My niece loves it and reads pages to me whenever I visit. That being said, I'll be buying another copy to add to my own library.
