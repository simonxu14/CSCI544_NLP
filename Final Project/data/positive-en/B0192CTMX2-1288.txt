I got this for my Lady Boss for Christmas. We love reading his books. My Sister-In-Law & Neices got me started on them. I am not sorry that I have. I even have all of the movies so far. It has been a real joy to read these books & watch the movies. I hope there are more to come. I am looking forward to that.
