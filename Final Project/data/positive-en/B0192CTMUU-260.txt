As an adult I wanted to see what all the hype was about. I'm glad that I found out. The Potter books are excellent. The fourth book is much darker than the other three but I think it reflects how life changes as Harry gets  older. The book may not be suitable for children under nine since some of  the situations may be frightening. Rowling weaves a wonderful tale and one  really hates to leave Hogwarts at the end of each book. Waiting for Vol 5  eagerly. I listened to the 4th one on audio it is excellent, atmospheric  and made me sit in my car to catch just a few more minutes .....
