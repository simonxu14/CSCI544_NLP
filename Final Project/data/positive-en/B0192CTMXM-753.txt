I was afraid we would never see this book.  But it was well worth the wait.  We get our old time favorite characters and some new ones to love and hate.  This book is packed with adventures and character development!  You really get to see each one grow-even ones who you think are "all knowing."<br />I love the way Rowling makes the book a team effort.  While Harry Potter may be the name of the book, he is by no means the only character to love.  This book does an amazing job of spreading the wealth of good and bad things that can happen to all that attend Hogwarts and live in the Wizarding world.  Not all things happen to Harry.<br />There is another death in this book.  You are given a few it could be and then when it happens... you will be saddened.<br />Overall I really have loved this book, and I can not wait for the next two.<br />I know JK said she was only going to write 7 books about Harry's life in Hogwarts... but I do hope we get even more after they leave.  I think she has built a world with never ending potential.<br />Thanks JK for another wonderful story.
