I'm a dedicated fan of Harry Potter, so have read all five books. Though this latest doesn't have quite as many inventive twists and turns in the plot as the one previous to it, The Order of the Phoenix still stands up to great storytelling standards and pulled me through those many, many pages so quickly that I can't believe I finished the book by Monday night.<br />(And by the way, a huge thanks to Amazon, who delivered the book into my waiting hands right on time last Saturday.)<br />I can't seem to get enough of this series. So okay then, Ms. Rowling -- no more vacation for you -- get back to work because we're all ready for Book Six now!
