I was very impressed with Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, as I have been with all of JK Rowling's works.  The only thing that I didn't like about HP5 is that it seemed to be a little long.  There were some things that could have been left out without hurting the story.  Because some of the books are so long, some people won't start reading the series.  I, personally, love to read, so this didn't stop me from re-reading the books, but I do feel this one was a little long.  Other than that, I loved the book.  I feel JK Rowling did an especially good job with helping the reader to feel how hard it was for Harry to have to deal with the way that everyone treated him during this year.  Another great work!
