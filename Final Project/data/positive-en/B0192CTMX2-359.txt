In the third installment in the Harry Potter series Rowling drops Harry into his third year at Hogwarts after a difficult summer with his nasty relatives the Dursley's who give Harry a long and tiresome summer holiday filled with yelling, and an unpleasant visit from an aunt who gets more than she bargained for from the young wizard who does not deal well with ugly mutterings from a smug muggle (non-wizard or witch) about his parents.<br /><br />After an exciting exit from his Uncle's home Harry begins a school year at Hogwart's where he finds out that an escaped convict is after him, between this;  dark magic, Hermione getting a 'homicidal' new cat this is after Ron's mouse and trying to save one of Hagrid's skin crawling creatures from extinction, this Harry Potter book was my favorite one in the series thus far.<br /><br />For more of my reviews check out my blog at www.booksalicious.blogspot.com
