The longest book in the series. Amazing story that can be appreciated by adults and teens alike, but not well-suited for young children.<br />Do not be intimidated by the size of the book, if you have read the previous four books and are a fan of the series, you will fly through this book in a matter of days (best to start during a weekend, because you won't want to stop).<br /><br />Also, make sure you own a copy of the next book as well, because you'll probably want to start that immediately upon finishing this one.
