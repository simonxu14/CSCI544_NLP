This book is the best book I have ever read.I especially like it because of the twist ending. The very ending is very humerous. My Higher education class wrote another &quot;book&quot;. it was extremely interesting.<br />I am  a writer as well. I write poems as well as short stories. Though I am only  10, I am writing a 100 pg. story,called CYBER WAR. I am wishing for the 4th  book for my birthday, which is at the end of  July.<br />My compliments go to  the author, J.K. Rowling.
