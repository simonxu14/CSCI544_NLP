Let me start off by saying that I LOVE Harry Potter. So i may be a little biased. But the quality of this book is incredible. The illustrations are gorgeous and really transport you to the wizarding world. I bought this book for my fiance (who is 25 and also loves HP) and he absolutely loved it! The great thing about this book is not only can we, as adults, enjoy this book, but we can also read this to our children and get them interested in reading at an early age.<br /><br />The package arrived right on time (with Amazon 2 day shipping) and came in perfect condition!<br />Very pleased with this product!
