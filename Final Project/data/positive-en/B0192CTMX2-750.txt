My copy of Order of the Phoenix arrived yeseterday and I spent the entire night reading it. It's a fantastic book. While some readers may be put off by the darker tone of the book (and by Harry's behavior, which at times is atrocious) it's obvious to me that J.K. Rowling really remembers what it was like to be a teenager and how incredibly painful growing up could be at times.<br />In book 5 we get to see life inside of the Ministry of Magic and St. Mungo's hospital, and we learn more about the darker side of the world of wizardry that Harry inhabits, not just the evil of Voldemort and the Death Eaters, but the stupidity and prejudices of the wizarding community. Harry learns more about Neville Longbottom's parents and meets new wizards and some old (including the real Alastor Moody). I don't want to go into more detail as it might spoil things for those who haven't read the book yet.<br />Again I say that the book was well worth the three year wait, although it's kind of depressing to think that if this is the norm for the next two books that we won't see the end of the series until 2009.
