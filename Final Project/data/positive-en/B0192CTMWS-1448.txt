J. Rowling did some things that were rather puzzling in this book, but she has helped to really develop several of the characters much more deeply in this book and to uncover deep struggles: Ron Weasley, Harry Potter, Albus Dumbledore, Severus Snape, Hermione Granger, etc.<br />This book was a mixture of joy and sadness as well as respect for the author's use of theme and elaborate plot.
