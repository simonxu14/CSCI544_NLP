In my opinion The Chamber of Secrets is better than the first. Not only does Harry once again fight against those who would do him harm: but he gets to outsmart a giant snake. In this book we get to learn some more about Hermonie, Ron, Harry's family, but we learn that something was passed on to him, the night he got his scar. If you have only seen the movies based on the series, you are missing out. The books go more in depth on the characters and the plot. The movies (although very good) tend to skip over parts of the book. My suggestion is to read the books first, then watch the movies. I hope this helps.
