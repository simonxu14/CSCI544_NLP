A wonderful book to end the series.  Very well written with no loose ends.  I won't say much here because I don't want to give away any of the book's content.  But, I wasn't disappointed and I don't think that many readers will be.<br /><br />We are so fortunate to be able to read this now, as it was being written and when the ending was not known.  What a treat for our generation!
