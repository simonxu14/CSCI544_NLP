While I was glad to finally have some of my questions answered and to be given information that will probably be important for the next two books, I found OOP quite long and overly expositive.  I once had a writing teacher who insisted we "show, don't tell."  I think Rowling could have used this advice.  Harry doesn't even get to school until page 200!  It was nice to visit old friends after three years.  Sometimes I found it hard to drown the voices of the child actors who portrayed the main characters in the movies, but by page 400, Harry and friends where talking in the voices I heard them use before the movies came out.  There were a few inconsistencies--including one where Harry loses his wand and somehow has it back in the next chapter!  (If you know what page it was returned to him on, please let me know, because I couldn't find it anywhere!)  The changes in Harry, Ron and Hermione as they are becoming young adults are great!  Tempers flare a lot more in this latest installment.  In all, an enjoyable read.
