For the first 90% of the book, Rowling is at her best.  The reader shares Harry's wonder as he discovers his new life.  The details are engaging and inventive and carry the plot easily.<br /><br />The last 10% is fun, but contrived and really outside the world she creates in the first 90% and continues in the later books.  It only works in the end because Harry realizes he's been set up by Dumbledore.
