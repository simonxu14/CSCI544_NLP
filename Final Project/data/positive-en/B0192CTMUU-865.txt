This comment is only for those who have already read Book 4. Please do not proceed if you haven't read the book as yet.<br />Ms. Rowling made a major logical flaw when it came to solving the first task. The golden egg could  have been retrieved by the same charm that Harry used to get his broom  stick! Ms. Rowling could have corrected the error by injecting special  powers to Dragons such that the charm could not be used. But as it stands,  this is a major booboo!
