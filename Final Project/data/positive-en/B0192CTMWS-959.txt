We heard about these books from a friend who raved so that we had to give them a try.  The kids could not put them down despite pleas from their friends to come outside and play.  I got my book club to read The  Sorcerer's Stone for its selection, so I could have a good excuse to read  it!  Well, I went through all three as fast as I could, and I can hardly  wait for more.  I found the books to be old-fashioned children's books,  like the Oz series and Narnia and even Treasure Island.  Fantasy,  adventure, bravery, friendship, bad guys, good guys, scary parts, sad  parts, happy parts, magic, dragons, unicorns, hippogriffs, and, of course,  school and all that school entails for kids.  Bravo!
