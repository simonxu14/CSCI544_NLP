I adored reading the Harry Potter books, but I always wished I could hear them read in the appropriate British accent.  Jim Dale is not only an excellent reader of the books, he creates remarkable voices for each character.  His readings have given me new insight into the books.  I recommend purchasing any of the audio CDs of the Harry Potter books, as read by Jim Dale.
