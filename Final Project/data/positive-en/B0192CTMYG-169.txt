I'm not a native Spanish-speaker, just someone who loves the language and likes to keep in practice. I know enough idiomatic Spanish to know that this is a pretty literal translation, but for someone who really needs to practice the tenses and vocabulary more than natural spoken language, this is actually perfect. Plus it's just a fun story & characters! The printing/binding is perfect (unlike some of the US/English editions I bought when they were first released). I do wish it were available on Kindle, though. But I've bought the rest of the series, and am really looking forward to it.
