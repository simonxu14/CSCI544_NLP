The book was great, but in comparison to Book 4 (the best one in the series, I think), it is very sloppy. There were very few links to the previous books and the ending was wrapped up too quickly. However, it certainly satisfies the cravings I've had for knowing how it all ends. It's an amazing book, but if you compare it to Rowling's potential, it seems weak.
