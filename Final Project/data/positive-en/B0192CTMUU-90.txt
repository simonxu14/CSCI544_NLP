Harry Potter's 4th year at Hogswarth does not disappoint! As this new adventure begins, we find Harry's nemesis is at it again, trying to regain a foothold in the real world. The prediction of Madame Trelorne was  actually correct, and Wormtail is definitely assisting him in attempt at a  return to power. This is one of only hundreds of things that happen to  Harry, Hermani, and Ron in this latest installment. Definitely an excellent  read, for adults as well as children. I could not put it down, and had to  fight with my son over who's turn it was to sit and read. The entire Harry  Potter series has opened a whole new world of reading to thousands of  children, my own included! Although the subject matter is a tad scary, and  the book is very long, over 700 pages, it will not deter even the youngest  fan of the series from reading it from cover to cover, no matter how long  it takes! The only draw back to this book; that we will have to wait over a  year to find out what happens to Harry at his 5th year in Wizarding School!
