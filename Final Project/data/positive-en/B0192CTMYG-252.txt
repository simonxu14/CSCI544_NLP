I'll tell you this. My girlfriend was adamant that she wouldn't like the story. She swore that she had no interest in Harry Potter, so I made a bet with her, I dared her to read the first page, if she could read it, and put the book down. I'd take her out to dinner right then. I left the room to grab something out of the refrigerator, a friend called me on my phone. We talked for an hour, by the time I got back in the room, she was on chapter 3... nuff said.
