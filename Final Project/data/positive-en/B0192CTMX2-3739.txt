Another nice story in the Harry Potter series.  Answers some of the questions readers had about Harry's scar and his connection to Voldemort, but ends in a satisfactory cliffhanger as the last chapter is titled, "The Second War Begins".  Even at 870 pages, you can read it in a weekend and still wish there were a few more chapters to go.
