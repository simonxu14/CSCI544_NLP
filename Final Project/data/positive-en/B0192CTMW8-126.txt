I bought this in Dec. and while the book is fantastic the first time it was shipped to me after waiting for two weeks a full 11 days after what was said to be the latest arrival date I was sent the wrong book."Bratfest at Tiffany's" Yikes! a far cry from this wonderful masterpiece. Nonetheless the book,once I was given the correct one, is beautiful and a great buy for a good price worth the wait.
