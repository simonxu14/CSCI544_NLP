My son's school had a book fair and he loves everything Pokemon right now.  He wanted this book so bad, but it was so expensive.  I'm a bargain shopper, so I pulled out my phone and found this one on amazon for, if I am remembering correctly, $7 CHEAPER!!!  That's huge in my book... so I ordered it up.<br /><br />He has a hard time putting this book down and likes to tell me how many of the pokemon's are in it, and what they do and all kinds of stuff that is way over my head...  :-)
