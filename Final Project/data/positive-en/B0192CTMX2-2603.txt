This book is really good. I always thought Harry Potter was just for kids, but kept up with the movies. After seeing the Half-Blood Prince movie, I was so curious, I decided to find out what happens in the story. I started from the beginning and worked my way through the books. This book was really good, and there are parts that the movie never touches. Great read for any Potter fan out there young or old.
