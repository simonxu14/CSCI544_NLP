The first book of the Harry Potter series was a brilliant starter, suitable in my opinion for all ages (i.e. for those who can read). This is definately not  book a for small children however, due to the violence and cruelty that peppers the book. It still is a good fantasy book, well on the level or above of the most of current fantasy literature but its not on the level of the first book. If you are a Harry Potter fan, you will definately want to read this, as it provides all the answers, i.e. regarding Dumbledore's death, his past and on how Harry can battle Voldemort. In fact there is a short spellbattle between them right at the beginning at the book.<br />In short, don't expect the level of Tolkien's writing but you can expect a good fantasy novel with an all-out magical war between good and evil. If you are a HP fan, also prepare for some bloody fights and deaths of many good characters.
