I confess.  I have an 11 year old granddaughter, but I would have read the Harry Potter books anyway!  I am well-educated, with an A.B. and J.D.  Really good children's books are not limited by age. The 3d book in the  Harry Potter series is by far the best---and the other two are excellent.  They are for all ages, not just the young.  You should discuss the ethical  issues with your children/grandchildren.  The stories captivate both young  and old.  (Okay, middle-aged.)
