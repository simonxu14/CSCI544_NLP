The book starts with Harry using magic to drive away dementors in front of his cousin, Dudley. Harry is almost expelled from Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardy, but isn't because he only used magic in self-defense. Harry goes back to school after visiting Sirius Black for a while with dreams of a corridor leading to a black door. The year goes on with him having these dreams until Christmas time when he has one where he was a snake and he attacked Mr. Weasley and it turned out to actually happen. The rest of the year continues with Harry still having these dreams of the corridor, he comes to figure out Voldemort is probably controlling the dreams; Harry gets further and further each time until he gets to a room with a bunch of orbs. Down one of the aisles Sirius is there getting tortured by Voldemort so Harry figures out it's in the Department of Mysteries in the Ministry of Magic and he goes to save Sirius. He was tricked. Sirius wasn't really there Voldemort was just messing with his mind. Sirius goes to save Harry and is killed. The Ministry now believes Voldemort has returned to power.
