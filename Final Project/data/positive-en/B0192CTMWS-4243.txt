NO SPOILERS!  I enjoyed the pace and depth in this story.  It may go down as my favorite of the seven.  The characters of Snape & Dumbledore get much more detail that rounds them out and helps you see them as who they were overall, not just as "all good" or "all bad".  The book ends conclusively.  Some have told me they thought the epilogue was a bit cheesy or too much.  I was glad for it even if it told the only possible future given the events of this book.  Thanks JK!
