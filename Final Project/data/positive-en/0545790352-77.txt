The artwork is absolutely beautiful. I got this for my 4 year old niece who loves to be read to, and she enjoys all the drawings. I already have 2 versions of the HP series, the first edition hardbacks and one of the new cover illustrations that came out last year. After looking through this one I'm pretty sure I'll be buying it for myself as well! :) Any Harry fan would love it!
