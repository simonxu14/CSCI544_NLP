Definitely a not to be missed book - perhaps the best story of our time!<br /><br />Howev, my review is about something else.<br /><br />The last 20 pages or so are so mundane, forgetful, so frustrating - that I am compelled to say, FORGET IT!<br /><br />This is from a dear fan who is on the same page with you - you will be happier if you never read the conclusion - seems forced, contrived, wooden, and not at all what I would expect these characters to do.  Strange.<br /><br />I think you will have a much happier time if you just closed the book before the epilogue - If you check it out, you won't like it and it will trouble you.<br /><br />I really, really mean it !!!!!  It seems dashed off - like they were in a hurry!  Too Hollywood for HP!!!!!!!!  Avoid that last bit with determination - just a few pages!!!!  You'll prefer it -<br /><br />With love and respect -<br /><br />Scott
