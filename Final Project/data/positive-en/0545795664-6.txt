PERFECT for the pokemon lover. This has settled many a debate and has led to an added amount of knowledge of the pokemon universe. Although it does not have a page on every single pokemon, it seems that it at least pictures them with their variation. My Sons and husband Love this book and refer to it. Good to get the kids to read some more for fun as well.
