I was always going to buy this edition no matter what, but it really exceeded my expectations. Every illustration is beautifully and excellently crafted. Every chapter title has its own unique illustration along with many full and half page illustrations. Other pages just have a few little drawings. However I would say its 50% of the book is full/half page illustrations.. I'm really just blown away by the artistry. Jim Kay did an absolutely great job. The characters are all drawn based on J.K Rowling's descriptions of them. The pages are glossy and heavy. I highly recommend this to any Harry Potter fan. It is worth every penny!
