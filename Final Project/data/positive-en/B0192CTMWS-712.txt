PROS: I really enjoyed this conclusion to the Harry Potter series. It was lots of fun. I read it in about 48 hours. The climactic scene was great! Rowling brings everyone back into action: it's like seeing a host of old friends. Molly Weasley has a GREAT moment.<br /><br />I don't always love Rowling's prose (take a look at how many adverbs she uses when her characters talk: Harry said testily, Hermione said prissily, Ron said lazily), but she has created a wonderfully detailed, colorful, exciting world and has developed characters that I care about (even when I don't always like them). I couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />CONS: I got a wee bit bored during a certain section, but frankly, the characters themselves were bored during that section, so I suppose it's fitting. At one point near the end, I couldn't figure out how a certain character had gotten a certain item, but upon rereading, it made sense.<br /><br />Some of my minor gripes are well articulated in Lev Grossman's TIME blog entry entitled "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: The Spoiler Post. This Post Contains Major Major Major Harry Potter Spoilers. Minor Ones Too" (July 23, 2007 - available on-line).
