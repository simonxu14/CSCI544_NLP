I JUST FINISHED THIS BOOK 870 pages long of writing.. .it was so exciting reading the book cover to cover... i didn't get up as i read the book, it was the best harry potter book so far of the series... i would recommend this book to anyone with a vivid imagination as the characters just leap off the pages and i commend author J.K. Rowling on another book well done
