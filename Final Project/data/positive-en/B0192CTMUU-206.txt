The latest Harry Potter tale is just as compelling and imaginative as the ones that preceded it, full of creative twists and turns.  But like the others in the series, &quot;The Goblet of Fire&quot; is not primarily a  book about witchcraft, except for its delightfully peculiar setting. It is  a book about life, and how it can be at turns both exhilerating,  satisfying, terrifying, confusing or sad. It is also a book about choices,  friendship, loyalty and great personal courage. The popularity of this  series is testimony to the great longing of today's children to make sense  of the things that happen to them in life. J.K. Rowling joins the ranks of  C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien and Susan Cooper in reworking the deep myths of  traditional folklore to meet this search for meaning and to help readers  sort out the critical issues of good and evil that confront them at every  age of life.
