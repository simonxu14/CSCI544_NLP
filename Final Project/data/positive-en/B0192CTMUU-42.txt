My first impression after reading the book was how similar it was to the Star Wars movies when they first came out. Everyone anxiously awaited The Empire Strikes Back, but as the bad guys seemed more powerful and kept the  heroes on the run throughout, many fans were disappointed. THE GOBLET OF  FIRE is very similar, as Lord Voldemort returns to power and keeps all our  heroes struggling to keep up with him.<br />THE GOBLET OF FIRE, as promised by  J. K. Rowling, is a much darker story than the first 3 books. There's lots  of action throughout, as we follow Harry to the World Quidditch Cup in  August and then to Hogwarts for the school year and the first Triwizard  Tournament in ages. Due to the high death toll in previous tournaments,  they had been discontinued, so everyone is a bit apprehensive. Students  from 2 other wizardry schools in Europe have been invited to participate,  and only the most senior students (17 years old) may enter their names into  the Goblet of Fire. The Goblet selects one student from each of the 3  schools as entrants, so imagine everyone's surprise when a  4th person is  selected--Harry! But who placed his name in the Goblet of Fire? Danger  abounds in every tournament event.<br />We see our old friends and meet many  new characters. As always, the people in Harry's world are well drawn and  very interesting. I would have liked to see more day-to-day life at  Hogwarts, as that has always been the most fun for me. In spite of running  over the entire year, we see very little of classes as the book  concentrates more on the tournament. The book ends after the tournament is  over, but don't expect a nice resolution to the story. The characters are  busy planning avenues of attack against Lord Voldemort, which sets things  up for Book 5. Be sure to read these books in order, as each builds on the  previous.
