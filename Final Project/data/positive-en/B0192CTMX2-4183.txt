All the Harry Potter books make for excellent reading. This book however, is the best of the series. Rowling out-did herself for the final book.  Book #7 drew me in from page 1. I couldn't put the book down. The twists and turns had me on the edge of my seat, holding my breath in anticipation for what would happen next! It was fantastic reading, I hope to read more about Harry Potter in the future.I have loved the story from book #1, and I hope Rowling does more with Harry Potter.
