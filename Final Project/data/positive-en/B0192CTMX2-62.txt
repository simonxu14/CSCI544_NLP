When the Dark Lord orders round-ups of "Mudbloods" and even distrusts the "Halfbloods," I couldn't help but think of Nazi Germany's "cleansing" campaign against the Jews.  Seen in this light, Harry Potter and the resistance (Dumbledore's Army) come off like Christians who aided and abetted the Jews during WWII.  HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS (Book 7) has that kind of Armageddon, Good vs. Evil feel to it -- as it should.<br /><br />Per usual, J.K. Rowling shows she is a master of plot as she pulls many strings together in this series-closing book.  Key to the last tome is her splicing of a new element (the Hallows) with an old one (the Horcruxes).  Also in the mix is Severus Snape.  Look up "ambivalent" in the dictionary and you'll find his name.  Readers have been that confused about him and Rowling uses it to good effect here.<br /><br />As for the theme of love vs. evil, it has already been at work in previous editions.  Rowling plays her cards wisely and the ending (That-Which-Can't-Be-Named) is, to my mind, brilliant.  Yes, you might guess the denouement, but no, you'll never guess the explanation for it.  So there.  Reason to read through 749 pages -- which practically happens on its own, anyway.  This book should please Potter devotees as well as newcomers to the series.  A rollicking-good read, as they say.  The Hype, in other words, has met its match (and that in itself is magical, in these overhyped days...).
