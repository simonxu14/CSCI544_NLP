Afer hearing of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone as being either 1) a great children's book or 2) something akin to a witches' bible, I bought this book, as so many others have done, simply to see what all the Harry  Potter hype was about.  As a middle-aged adult whose taste in books ranges  from literature to history to current events, may I say that I have seldom  enjoyed a book as much as this one.  I wonder if the benighted people who  condemn JK Rowlings as guilty of promoting Satanism also pass the same  verdict on Hans Christian Anderson and the Brothers Grimm.  The book was  fun, fantasy, and pure escapism, and that is all it sets out to be.  On all  three counts, it succeeds brilliantly.  I finished the first book yesterday  and am looking forward to reading the sequels... hopefully, all six.  Kudos  to Rowling for creating an instant -- and enduring -- classic for all ages.  (Now if I could just get hold of a real Nimbus Two Thousand.....)
