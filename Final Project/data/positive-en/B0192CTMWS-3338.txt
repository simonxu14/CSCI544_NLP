I briefly scanned over the bad reviews, and I do not understand what these people were expecting? It is a fictional story! This book was just as good as all the others in the series. I loved the "epilogue". It was heart warming to, finally, see Harry find happiness.<br /><br />To address the reviewer who says Rowling is not much of an author, well her books have sold millions and all have been made into major Hollywood films. Not many authors can make claim to that.<br /><br />I will buy anything Rowling produces in the future. I hope she will continue to write. Someone with her passion cannot stop now. That would be cheating her fans.<br /><br />I look forward to some day reading the Harry Potter books to my grandchildren.<br /><br />If you do not yet own all the Harry Potter books, I strongly advise you get the whole series. You will truly enjoy it.
