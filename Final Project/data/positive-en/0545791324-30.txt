I purchased the UK version of Philosopher's Stone (mostly for the &#34;Philosopher's&#34; instead on &#34;Sorcerer's&#34; on the cover), but preordered american version of CoS. While Chamber of Secrets title is identical between US and UK versions, cover is still a little different. It has different fonts, and also UK version paper cover has some kind of velvet feeling when you touch it, while US version is just a regular gloss paper. Not sure if I will be replacing this with the UK version yet.<br />Inside I think they are completely identical (since text was not americanized). Illustrations are just perfect, these are one of the most beautiful books I've ever seen.
