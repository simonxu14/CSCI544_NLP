Having spent the last day and a half reading "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" and not having the energy for a midnight pickup, I've avoided pretty much everything online to avoid spoilers, this review is written with the desire to have no spoilers, so I'll get right to the point.<br /><br />J.K. Rowling was right in the interviews-- all the questions are answered, the backstory is filled in, and it all fits together.  Perhaps more importantly, the narrative is fantastic, a rare capture of continuing the increasing darkness of the previous books but never losing that shining beacon of hopefulness.<br /><br />As someone who's read each the three previous book on release day, I certainly wasn't disappointed.  "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" lives up to the promise of the series.  I suspect no one needs it, but this book certainly gets my recommendation.  The only downside is that there's not another one to look forward to.
