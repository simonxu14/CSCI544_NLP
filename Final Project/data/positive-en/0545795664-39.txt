If you've got kids into Pokemon they'll love this book.<br />Pictures are nice and vibrant and even for non readers it's nice because it shows the evolution of the Pokemon.<br />I would recommend. Not bad for the price.<br />Updated: we've had this book for about a month and almost 1/3 of the pages have been pulled out. They come out VERY easily. Just an FYI.
