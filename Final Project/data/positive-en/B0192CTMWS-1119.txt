....<br />What do you get? Basically a very beautiful book. The feel of the book is wonderful, the additional artwork suitably gloomy and mysterious and the cloth cover is a wonderful thing to have. And, who knows? It could end up to be a sought-after item in years to come?<br />If you're on a budget, by the standard edition. If you have a little extra to spare (I used an unexpected gift certificate) and are a big Potter fan, get this edition - it's truly beautiful.
