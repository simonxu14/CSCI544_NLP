Harry and his mates are growing up, and this adds much to the complexity of the new book.  Not only are there myriad twists and turns in the plot of Goblet of Fire, but also the 14 year old hormone bank kicks in and boy/girl  relations turn from pure friendship to romance.<br />All of the old characters  return, plus several new ones are introduced, such as Mad Eye Moody.  The  book is long, 730+ pages, and the plot and characters are well defined and  embellished, and the list of magical creatures and spellbinding action  grows on.<br />This is the richest of the books so far, as Harry is tested  almost beyond his capacity.  The dark scenes are treated with care and  compassion.  Feelings play a large role in this tale of winning, losing and  playing the game.<br />Can't wait for the next episode!
