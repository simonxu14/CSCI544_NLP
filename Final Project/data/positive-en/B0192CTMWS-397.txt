I almost didn't want to read the seventh book. One, I couldn't stand the idea of the story finally ending. Two, I had heard the rumors and wondered if they might be true. After finishing the tome and talking with many other Potter fans, I realized the story ended on a perfect note. Thank you, Ms. Rowling, for a wonderful tale about a boy who grew up to be a wonderful and multifaceted young man.<br /><br />Kevin Gerard - Author of Diego's Dragon, Book One: Spirits of the Sun
