I have followed several series of novels in the past few years and every one has disappointed me when the final book is written and read. Deathly Hallows breaks that mold for me. From page one, the mood is set and Ms Rowling takes you with Harry on his final journey in his epic battle between good and evil, personified in his nemesis, Voldemort.<br /><br />I was pleased to see how many of the characters have grown and matured through the series, especially a few of the Gryffindors, who are always known for their bravery. As we have "watched" these characters grow, we have indeed become attached to them, and we hold our breaths as their fates dangle precariously by a thread.<br /><br />As with all good sagas, we say goodbye to several characters, several which were a surprise to me. I will ruin the book for no one, but I will say that a few of the deaths in the book hit me harder than I had expected.<br /><br />The suspense leading up to the finale and the climax of the book bring the series to a very satisfying close. I believe that "Deathly Hallows" brings closure to the ending of Harry's stories. My one wish is that J. K. Rowling's outstanding series will turn a world of children who have been with Harry since year one into artists themselves, taking quill in hand and spreading their empty parchment before them to write their own stories of adventure and danger. With Ms Rowling as a role-model, we may yet see a new rennaissance of literature in the next decade.
