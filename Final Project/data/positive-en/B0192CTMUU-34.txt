Christian opponents, worried parents and paranoid cult haters have all found reason to hate this series. I have a brief statement to make. I am a Christian and a parent of two young children. I believe that this book only impacts young people negatively, if the parents do not communicate with their children about what is fiction and what is not. I read the newspaper daily, and I don't believe in murder. If these books draw even one child into the glorious world of reading, then Ms. Rowling has done great things for society!!
