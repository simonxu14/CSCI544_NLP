This isn't a review on the story itself, but rather on the quality of the book; the cover and spine were in fine condition, but at least 5 of the pages had ruined, blotted ink--so blotted that I couldn't read those parts. Fortunately, I had read this book before, but I was disappointed in those flaws.
