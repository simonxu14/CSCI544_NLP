As a 12 year old reviewer (yes, I checked the over 13 box) I want to tell the adults that this is the best Harry Potter book. It is a very interesting book with all of its twists and turns.  Most of the story lines were completed and done well.<br />I'm not going to give anything away, for the people who are still reading. I highly recomend this book to all ages. (just a tip, read very carefully, and read EVERYTHING).
