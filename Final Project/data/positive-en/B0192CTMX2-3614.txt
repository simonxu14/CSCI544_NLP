I'm asked by people who have not read any of the Harry Potter books what I thought about the 7th book.  I liked it, I can't say that I love it as just the 7th book.  But I do love the whole series.  I love in the 7th book how she answered all the questions and she superbly made me want to reread the whole series all over again to catch the little tidbits that she used to wrap up the answers to the big questions.<br /><br />It's hard to explain this series to someone that's never read any of the books....  Most book series are hard to follow, most authors don't follow a good timeline.  They jump around in ways that don't make sense.  They try to bring in new twists that don't make sense to the previous books.  I have repeatedly stopped reading other series of books because they lost their original shine, their attraction, or the motivation that got me to read the next book of the series.<br /><br />But JK Rowling is completely different.  Her series is masterful!  It's as if she sat down and wrote the whole series out before sending out the first book (which we know is not the way she did it, it just appears that way).  Each book builds onto the other, things that were barely noticed before, show their importance later (you remember that she pointed something out at the time, but you weren't sure why until later).  And the way she does it makes sense - it doesn't come across like she went back through her books just to find a tidbit that she decided to tie into the big picture at the last second.<br /><br />In the course of the series, she tackles very important issues: taking responsibility for your actions, taking your punishments when you knew you were breaking the rules, gender inequality, race discrimination, hero worship and then finding out that the hero made mistakes too, jumping to conclusions before learning all the facts, - the list just goes on and on.<br /><br />To think that the first Harry Potter book was the VERY first book that she ever wrote - it's just mind blowing!  Most authors write a dozen books or more before getting their first book published.  Here, she wrote her first book, got it published and rightly it's a best seller that's truly worth all the hype.  There are only 3 authors that I have bought the books in hardback, this is one.  Not only that, even of the 3 authors, this is the only author that I have pre-ordered, then quickly read to completion.<br /><br />I'm very picky about books that I recommend and this is a series that I recommend whole heartedly.  This is not just a children's book series, this is a series that all ages can enjoy.  To me, the movies don't come anywhere close to doing this series justice.  Anyone that just watches the movies doesn't know what they're missing not reading the series!
