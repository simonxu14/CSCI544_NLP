The book I purchased from Cascade Neighborhood Books was in MINT condition.  I was very impressed. I was surprised to find that this first edition was a United Kingdom first print, which I should probably have known.  However, while the book is in excellent condition and doesn't look like anyone has ever opened it, being that it is a UK printing, the size of this hardcover edition is about 1/3 smaller than any of the U.S. size printings that I own.  I prefer to read hardcover books as they are easier to hold onto and the print is much larger.  However, as I just finished the 6th book and have not started reading this book yet, I have just perused the print and find it is going to be interesting to read as the print is much smaller than a standard hardcover book.  I didn't see anywhere on the description that this was a "UK first edition/printing".  Even if I had, I don't think I would have realized the size difference.  It's something to consider if you're making an entire collection or like bigger print.  Still, it is an excellent product.
