J. K. rowling has an obvious formula, Harry Potter is misunderstood but sincere, under attack by evil forces, the victim of his unpleasant Muggle family, and the book climaxes with, what else, a duel to the death (someone else's death of course) with Lord Voldemort.  Lots of distraction in the form of the Weasley twins' new joke store, new magic animals, and new teachers.<br />However, it is a good read, although I found the absence of Dumbledore throughout most of the story to be strange, I think he is one of the most interesting characters.  Rowling has been compared to Dickens, and although her writing is not of the same quality, she shares with Dickens the ability to write a really satisfying, loooooong book that will keep you reading for several days.<br />Too many tricks, not enough substance, but still interesting and enjoyable.
