Yes, the book is long. Yes, the characters are growing up, and yes, someone does pass on (I'm still waiting for more information). But it's in a world many of us have come to love. And this book definitely gives us more time with those characters and places we love to read. We're even reunited with some that we haven't heard from in awhile. All in all, it's an excellent book. Rowling is getting better after each one, and for me, it's hard to pick a favorite. After reading Phoenix, it left me wanting more. It has a great flow, and I couldn't put it down. The plot develops wonderfully, giving us a hint of what's to come so that when we finally get there we're trying to point the characters away from the dangers.
