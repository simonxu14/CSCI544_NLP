In book five of the Harry Potter series, J. K. Rowling continues the wonderful story of the boy wizard we have all come to know and love.  I feel that Rowling's attention to detail and in-depth characterization are what make not only book five, but the entire series worthy of reading again and again, not just for the fun and exciting story line, but for the enjoyment of watching these characters grow and mature with time.<br />I recommend all of the Harry Potter books to anyone of any age.
