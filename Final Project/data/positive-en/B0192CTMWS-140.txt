I loved this series, and although I was worried that after how great it was the end might fizzle, J.K. Rowling somehow managed to end this series in a way that was incredibly satisfying. I loved each and every chapter, although I have a definate favorite that my husband and I both laughed and cried then entire time. I won't tell which, but if you've read it you know what I am talking about!!! Loved it, loved it, loved it. Amazing. J.K. Rowling most definately no longer dances in anyone elses footsteps...
