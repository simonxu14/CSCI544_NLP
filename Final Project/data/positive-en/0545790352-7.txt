This book is beautiful. Of course I'm a fan of the series and I know the content is good, but the illustrations are a really great touch. I bought it so I can read it to my kids as they get older, as a way to introduce them to Harry Potter before they can read it on their own--I'm hoping to sit down with my almost 6 year old soon and start to go through it, and this is the best way! I hope more come out!
