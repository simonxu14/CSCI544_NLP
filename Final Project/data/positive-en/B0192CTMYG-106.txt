I have had about 10 copies of this book,the first one my sister sent me from England. I taught in an inner city school.where the kids had not been read aloud to very often. I read a chapter a day to my classes every day. When I started to read Harry 1 the children were entranced. So much so that the book was stolen many times each year . So I started buying paper backs. which have fallen apart. that is why I ordered this copy.. Now  I read it to my grandchildren.
