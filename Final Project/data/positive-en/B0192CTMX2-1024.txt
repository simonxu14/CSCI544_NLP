What a great ride.  As soon as my eagerly awaited package from Amazon.com arrived I immediately took the portkey to Hogwarts.  Book 5 was well worth the wait.  Many questions are answered and many more are left open for future books.  Harry, now a 15 year old with typical 15 year old problems, as well as a few atypical ones, sees his relationships with everyone he holds dear tested as well as seeing some of his beliefs about his family shown to be less then accurate.  In the end it is the power that comes from having true frineds that really makes the difference.  How long before Book 6?
