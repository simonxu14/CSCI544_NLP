this review isn't really about the books story, but<br />about Amazon's delivery of the book, on the<br />day of release. Which the US Postal Service made<br />sure of.I preordered my books, and I was promised<br />day of release delivery and I had my books, from<br />the US Postal Service by 9AM on release day..<br />Just want to say good job to Amazon, and to the US Postal<br />Service. Didn't have to go wait in line, or travel anywhere<br />to get my books.
