Ok this book is absolutely gorgeous! The illustrations are so much fun! And there are illustrations on at least 75% of the pages! As an art student, I can totally appreciate the use of the watercolor illustrations in this book!! The artwork is very well done and the formatting for the writing is just amazing! It's sooo worth the money!!
