I received this book on the first day by FEDX.<br />I remembered to eat, then dove right in.  I am blessed to be able to read quickly....8.5 hours later I finished and came up for air.  I hadn't answered a single phone call, I'd forgotten to eat, I even forgot about going to the bathroom.<br />The characters were true to form, as in the previous books -- although the book could certainly stand on its own if one had never read the rest of the series.  One surprise after another awaits you.  There is grief and wonder in equal measure.  Harry continues to mature and grow, as does the rest of the characters.  We are given pure evil to hate and despise; we are handed hope.  There is plenty of suspense.<br />READ THIS BOOK.
