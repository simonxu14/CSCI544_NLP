As usual, JK Rowling has outdone herself. To be honest, I miss the silliness of the first books (Howlers, Rembralls, etc), but the way she ties everything together is amazing. It makes sense that the books get darker and more serious as Harry gets older, and now that he's an adult, the 7th book is serious, but still with great imagination. She also shows how life really is, even in this fantasy world, there are good people gone bad, and bad people who do good things. It can't be read without reading the first six, but anyone who hasn't read them should read them just to read Deathly Hallows.
