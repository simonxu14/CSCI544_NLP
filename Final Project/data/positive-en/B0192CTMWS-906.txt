Harry enters his fifth year at Hogwarts with a tremendous change to his personality. Alack, he has truly become a teenager. The character development in this series is why the books sell so well. This particular storyline is filled with such awful gut-wrenching occurrences that you begin to wonder why Harry tries at all. You feel sorry for the little dude. You empathize with him. This book shows his emotions trying to figure out how to be adult and how to stay a kid; shows his attitude needing some serious adjustment and showing the break from authority that seems to be necessary to become an independent free-thinking adult. It's a hard book to read and an even harder book to put down. I love the whole series and eagerly await the arrival of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.
