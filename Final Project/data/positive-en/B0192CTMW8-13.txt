Read this book because it was on a list of books you should read to make you a more well rounded person. Was hesitant to do even with all the hoopla around thes books because I don't like fantasy books and although I know adults read them but there primarily geared towards kids. My daughter gobbled them up.<br />Anyway really a good book plus when you were reading it you didn't feel you were read a kid's book. Excellent story and character development. If your kids haven't read this book, I would recommend they do because Harry stands up to two bullies in a nonviolent manner and triumphs which would be a good message for kids to hear.
