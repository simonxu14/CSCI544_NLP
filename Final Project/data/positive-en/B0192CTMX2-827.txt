With getting a newer car - one that accommodates CDs but not cassette tapes - my collection of the Harry Potter books was not playable.  I had replaced all of them except Azkaban.  I found this one on Amazon, advertised as "new".  It arrived in three days and was in perfect condition. I'm a happy customer.
