When I first started reading Deathly Hallows I did not like how it was going but by the end of the journey; I realized what I had just read was the best book of the entire series which is hard for me to admit.  This book is a must read it will have you second guessing until the very end and wanting more.  All I can say to sum it up is you will not believe how it ends and it will leave you feeling like you should have seen it coming.  I plan to re read it again this time listening to the audiobook version so I can experience it on an even deeper level.  Must read for any true Harry Potter fan.
