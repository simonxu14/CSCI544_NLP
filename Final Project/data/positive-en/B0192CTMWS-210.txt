Needless to say the book is wonderful. What I'm trying to comment here is the shipping from Amazon. When I pre-ordered the book weeks ago amazon advertised it to be publishing day shipping, which should be 7/21. However, I waited until 7/24 that amazon sent me a email said the book was shipped. It took another five days for the book to arrive. Guessing with millions of pre-order amazon really couldn't keep its promise of publishing day shipping. So if you don't mind about more than one week delay you can buy from amazon. Otherwise if you want the book the second day after it's out try for book stores.
