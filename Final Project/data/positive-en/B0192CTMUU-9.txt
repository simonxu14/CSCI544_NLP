In the fourth installment of the Harry Potter series, the story takes a darker and more serious turn.  Harry Potter is growing up, and the danger that he faces is as sinister as it is real.  The story revolves around a competition between the various Wizarding schools, Hogwarts, Beaubaton and Durmstrang, and a plot by "You-Know-Who" to (surprise!) kill Harry Potter.<br /> As always, the new characters are delightful and as believeable as ever.  The plot twists will keep you guessing (and as usual, your guesses as to who the villian is will be wrong) as you learn more about Harry's past (and the past of others - such as Dumbledore and Snape for example.)  Yet  there is a darkness to this book, which may be off-setting to some.  There are stormclouds gathering on the horizon, and trouble is afoot.  Nonetheless I am confident you will love this book as much as the others.
