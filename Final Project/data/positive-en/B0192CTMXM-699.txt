Took me one day to read the whole thing.  As the other four books, you just can't put it down.  After 3 long years of waiting this book was everything and nothing like I expected.<br />Told in JRK's elegantly simple and complicated manner, she gives us a bigger view of HP's world.  No longer is the series confined to the school and its inhabitants, but focuses on the more important issues of what is going around in the wizarding world.  The war is about to begin, and the first battle takes place here.<br />Expect a lot of information and none at all.  It gives you answers, but makes you ask more questions.<br />Old characters are given new dimensions, and new characters are incredibly amusing.<br />Ron comes from behind Harry's shadow, Hermione tones down, Neville gains confidence, Ginny shows she's a true Weasley, Fred and George keep you guessing, and Harry grows and learns more than ever.<br />Other characters true colors, backgrounds and motivations are shown and/or hinted at.<br />The battle rages on, and the war is just begun.<br />JRK has made another incredibly wonderful novel, and I only hope book 6 & 7 don't take this long to be written.  I don't think I could stand the wait.
