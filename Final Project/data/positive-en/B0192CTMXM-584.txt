I love the Harry Potter series, so I was ecstatic to find the books for so cheap on Amazon, as compared to in stores. The book cover is a little torn up and the binding is a little worn, but I believe the seller included this in the description before I purchased this book. Those were my only complaints with this purchase. I would recommend the Harry Potter series to anyone who is interested in magic or folklore, such as the Lord of the Rings series.
