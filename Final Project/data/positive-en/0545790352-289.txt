This is supposed to be a children's book but I am way past childhood and have read the Harry Potter series several times and am about to read this first one again.<br />It is a gorgeous book and has a ribbon book marker attached.<br />It is a bit different than the first ones I've read.  English, English instead of American English.<br />Rumour instead of rumor etc.<br />The illustrations are beautiful and add a great deal to the reading experience.<br />I consider it well worth the cost and if the rest of the series is published as beautifully I will buy them all as they appear.
