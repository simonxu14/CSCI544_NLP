It is so beautiful! I remember a few years ago looking for an illustrated edition and not finding one and then about a week ago I decided to go searching again and here they are! And they're beautiful. I noticed in another review they were unhappy that their book was shipped in a box with no padding. I am glad to report that mine came in several sheets of extra puffy bubble wrap. It is in perfect condition and I couldn't be happier. My daughter will love it.
