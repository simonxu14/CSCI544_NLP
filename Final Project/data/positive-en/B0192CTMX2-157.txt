I think it's very, very sad that when people read the word "love" they automatically think of it as having to do with sex. I have read this book 4 times, the last time with my 12 year old daughter, and I NEVER ONCE thought that any of the quotes given by the previous reviewer were trying to allude to Dumbledore's sexuality!!!  I didn't think "sex" I thought of two teenage boys who were too smart and powerful for their own good becoming obsessed with plotting world domination (I have three very smart younger brothers and it's not a stretch to imagine them having that sort of conversation with their friends)!<br />If there was anything that read as having a remotely sexual undertone it was Alberforth and his obsession with goats, but I'm pretty sure that's not anything a kid would be thinking of!<br />I also never thought of Snape's love for Lily as creepy.  Okay, so he was a very creepy man, but Lily had been his friend and confidant since childhood.  He would do anything for her, even after her death. Snape's was the kind of love that Voldemort never understood and would never suspect would be anyone's driving force for betraying him.<br />Yes, the 7th book is definately dark and I wouldn't recommend even starting the series for younger then 5th grade. The series is written as seen through the eyes of Harry.  So, it starts out with being as innocent as an 11 year old and ends up as sad and bloody as an 18 year old going to war.<br />Sorry the last reviewer didn't like the ending.  Yeah, it does basically come out to, "And they all lived happily ever after..." but it makes you have to think about it.  It made for an interesting conversation between my daughter and I.  Personally I think Harry, who had expressed having had enough excitement to last him a life time, apprenticed to Olivander and learned all of the deep, dark secrets of wandmaking.  :~)
