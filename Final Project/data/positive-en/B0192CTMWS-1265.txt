This was definitely the most emotional Harry Potter of them all!  I was reading it from the moment I woke up until the moment my eyes closed every night.  It took me only 3 days to finish because I was on the edge of my seat wanting to know what was going to happen next!  It's a real nail-biter!  J.K. Rowling REALLY knows how to write!
