"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" is a triumph.  (No spoilers in this review).<br /><br />Rowling gathers together all the twisting and complex threads she's scattered throughout the preceding six books and weaves an agonizing and ultimately exhilarating and satisfying conclusion.  As I neared the conclusion I was wracked by competing emotions - loss and sorrow that this superb series would soon be over; joy and satisfaction for Harry, Snape, Dumbledore, Neville, Hermione and Ron; and admiration for Rowling.  She managed to craft an ending pitch perfectly in tune with the rest of the books.  An ending totally in keeping with what came before - and yet cataclysmic enough to surmount all the amazing peaks and worthy of this tremendously entertaining series.<br /><br />The Deathly Hallows, like all the preceding books, starts slowly.  Harry leaves the Dursleys; Harry finds himself increasingly outflanked and cut off.  Each scene is incredibly good - but the plot builds over hundreds of pages and you find yourself wondering "when will the headlong action begin?" - and "how will she have time to wrap this all up?".  Here, the headlong rush begins barely past half way and the final half of the book is an incredible thriller of a rollercoaster ride.  There's so much content that certain moments might appear rushed on later reflection but the pacing is so superb that no one can question her genius for thrilling action.<br /><br />Before starting this final book I worried that Rowling would be unable to craft an ending that wouldn't seem like an anticlimax.  After building the conflict between Harry and Voldemort for more 3600 pages how could the final showdown be anything but a bit of a letdown?  Well, Rowling proves her genius here.  She gathers all the magical threads and adds a new a stunning aspect - then she takes Harry's quest beyond magic and into the mythic.  I can't be more specific without giving things away - but believe me when I tell you she transcends fantasy here and takes us into the transcendental themes of Greek tragedy.<br /><br />Don't hesitate to buy and read this book.  If you haven't read the series, do yourself a favor and do so.  This is one for the ages.
