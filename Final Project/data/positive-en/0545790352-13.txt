I ordered it on November, and I just received it because it was temporarily out of stock!!!! It took me two months to get my hands on this BEAUTIFUL version!!!!!!! It's truly worth it!!!! It's sooooo beautiful! The illustrations inside the book really impress me!!! This is a must have for any Harry Potter fan!!!!!!!!!
