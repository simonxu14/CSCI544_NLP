I decided to reread the Harry Potter series after reading them several years ago with my daughter.  We did not have Year 7 in our collection.  I read this book in 1-2 weeks despite its length.  It keeps you interested.  I think it was the best book in the series.  So, if you liked years 1-6, you will love year 7.
