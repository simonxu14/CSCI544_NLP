This edition and its companion books carry the series from a popular book to a classic product.  The Harry Potter series has matured into a finely produced, collectible, cherished edition for the ages.  This edition is meticulously put together with the most durable binding of any edition, into books that will last for generations with normal care.  The binding, stitching, and ribbon book mark are hallmarks of the most prized of books, and deservedly so.<br />  I love the Harry Potter saga, and would enjoy it any edition.  But, the Bloomsbury Special edition gives it the cachet of a true classic, which I hold it to be.  This printing will, in a few years, amount to what a first illustruated printing of "Alice in Wonderland" amounts to.<br />  This edition amounts to the first real production of the Harry Potter series in a truly lasting book, rather than the falling apart editions we have suffered with for so long.  The Scholastic hardbound editions seem to hold up, but the paperback editions fall into loose pages.<br />  HP is finally taken seriously enough to become a sturdy, well published, well bound series of books.
