6 and 10 year old love these books. We read them before bed as a family and tell them they cannot watch the movie until we have read the book. As Harry ages the book content matures as well. After this one we decided the 6 year old will have to wait a while to continue as the violence is increasing. The 10 year old is continuing to read the next one on her own.
