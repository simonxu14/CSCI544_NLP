Should Quaker kids be reading Harry Potter stories?  As you no doubt know, Harry is a wizard in a world of dragons, warlocks, magic spells and battles.<br />  Reasons why Quaker kids should read Harry Potter:<br />* The Harry Potter books are wonderful for getting kids interested in READING.<br />* Most Quaker adults are Muggles, and the books teach kids how to deal with Muggles<br />* There are too few books out that interest boys in reading - the Potter books get boys AND girls interested in reading.<br />* There are too few books out that parents enjoy reading with their kids.<br />* Harry probably has Quaker routes - he's interested in social causes, the rights of the underdog, and general fairness to all.  He even leans toward non-violent solutions to most problems. This book especially touches on the social causes, as Hermione fights for the rights of the House Elves.<br />I have to confess, I found the beginning of this book simultaneously boring (too much Quidditch), and questionable as there was some brutality.  I was also saddened toward the end of this book at a death that could have been better handled.<br />But in the big picture, the sports theme is of interest to boys (girls, too), we can read and talk together, and my son's reading interest has gone up 100% since going through all 4 of these books.<br />The only downsize here is that we don't know what to read until  the fifth book comes out!
