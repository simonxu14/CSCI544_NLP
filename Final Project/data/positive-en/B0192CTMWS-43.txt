There is a chapter in this book titled &#34;The Wedding&#34; ---- My sweet daughter saw this book on Etsy -- they wanted $200 for the darn thing because someone decided to cut a heart shape hole starting at the wedding chapter --- I sealed mine with a Heart Shaped cookie cutter to give the completed box ring book a finished edge -- You tube has great videos to help you along your way to greatness !!! I secured the section with silk ribbon making it easier for the wedding couple to find the rings enclosed
