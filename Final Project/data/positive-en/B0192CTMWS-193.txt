I'm a 34 year year old professional, grown-ass man who likes to eat steak and drink whiskey.  Harry Potter first came out in the US when I was 19, making me too old to read this stuff.  I was never into wizards and fantasy stories anyway.  Last year, in between eating steaks topped with bacon and the tears of terrorists, drinking the world's finest Irish whiskey and entertaining the world's most beautiful ladies, I started reading the Harry Potter series at the encouragement of friends who work at the Pentagon.  I didn't like the first three, the fourth was somewhat entertaining, and this one is a little better.  Because I'm naturally intellegent and now older and wiser, these books are extremely easy to read for me.  Never-the-less, JK Rowling is an excellent author.
