This book lives up to all of our expectations of the Fourth Harry Potter book. This book starts off when Harry getsout of Privet Drive and joins his  friend Ron and Ron's family in the Burrow. Then Harry, the Weasley's, (even  Bill and charlie,)and Harry's other freind Hermione are off to the  Quidditch World Cup. After a spectacular game, (including dancing Veela  from Bulgaria and leprechans from Ireland) a crowd of dark wizards  terrifies everyone at the world cup and then the Dark Mark is conjured up,  ( You-Know-Who's sign)supposedly by Harry's wand.  After this strange  ending to the quidditch cup, the crowd of wizards returns to Hogwarts, only  to find out that there will be no quidditch at Hogwarts this year. The  reason for this is that Hogwarts will be hosting the Triwizard tournament,  in which Hogwarts will be competing with two other wizarding schools,  Beauxbatons and Durmstrong. Even, though wizards only above 17 can enter,  someone (possibly Lord Voldemort) has entered Harry into the mysterious  Goblet of Fire, and the Goblet has picked him. Harry is bound by a magical  contract to the tournament and to three deadly tasks. Will he survive?  While Harry is dreaming of Cho, and avoiding Snape, he also has something  else worrying him .... the Triwizard Tournament!
