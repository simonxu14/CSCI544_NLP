One day I was in the car while my mom was getting groceries. Iwas getting bored, so I looked around and saw this book. It lookedinteresting so I picked it up and started reading. I was right- it was interesting! and after awhile I couldn't put it down(It's very hard to get out of the car and into your house while reading a book, but I did it)! I couldn't read any other books while I was reading this one; it not only held my attention, it grabbed it! I would stay up 'til past midnight reading. I loved it and can't WAIT to get my hands on the next books!!
