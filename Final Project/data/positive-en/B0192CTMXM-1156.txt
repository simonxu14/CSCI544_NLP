I enjoyed this last installment of Harry Potter, it was fantastic! Loose ends were tied up, and all of my questions were answered. I couldn't have hoped for a better ending!  J.K. Rowling truly is a great writer and has a gift for being able to capture the feelings of the characters very well.  I will continue to treasure these books and re-read them whenever I'm looking for a bit of magic to be added to my daily routine.
