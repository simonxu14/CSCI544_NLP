My kids love this book and haven't put it down since they received it! This is all the Pokemons in one beautiful, easy to read handbook. It has a real slick cover.  My kids are 10 and 5 and this was originally available for order through Scholastic via their school. Amazon offered it for a less expensive price point and I was able to utilize my Prime and get it quickly (within two days instead of the two week in-school order time) satisfying my frugal needs and feeding my Amazon Prime addiction!!! Thank you Amazon.
