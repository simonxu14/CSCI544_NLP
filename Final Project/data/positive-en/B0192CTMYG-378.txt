I bought this book to continue my Spanish Education.  After I graduated high school, and went to college, I didn't want to let Spanish go, but I didn't need it for my College Degree.  So, I decided to continue improving my Spanish by reading.  Now, to be honest, I bought this book about 2 years ago, and have not yet finished the first chapter.  I just got a little lost in all of the new vocabulary.  But that is my inferior level of Spanish's fault, not the book's fault!
