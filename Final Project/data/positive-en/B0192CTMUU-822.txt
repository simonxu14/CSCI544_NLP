I was a little confused by the advertising, and it was not exactly what I was expecting,but when I reviewed the advertisement and what I received, the match was accurate.  I may not have purchased this edition had I gleaned a clearer understanding (a lack of a cover picture contributed to my misunderstanding), but it is a first edition in its format, as promised, so I ended up being very pleased.
