i enjoyed this book very much.  i thought Rowling did a great job bringing the reader into the world of Harry Potter.  i could feel the anger he felt right along with him.  i also think she was able to capture what a boy his age might actually be feeling after all that has happened to him in his life.  it took me a week to read the book only becasue i had to work also, but it was very hard to put down.  i was anxious to get to the end.  but when i did, well, i look forward to number 6.
