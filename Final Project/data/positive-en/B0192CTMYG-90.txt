My purchase of this novel was somewhat impromptu even though I had seen parts of the film. Overall it had a simplistic plot but an entertaining one nontheless. The characters were somewhat simple, but relatable in a way. Near the end of it I was compelled to finish it even though I didn't feel this enticed when I began.
