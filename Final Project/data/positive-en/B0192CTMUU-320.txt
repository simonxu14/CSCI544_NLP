This is the way I would've written a Harry Potter book.  Not too sappy, not too dark, plenty of action, and even some killing.  Definitely the best in the series (much better than No. 3, which was just plain terrible).  Harry Potter books will never be my all-time favorites, but for an  entertaining diversion they are hard to beat.
