This book was absolutely amazing.  The best yet!!!  I...strongly recommend the HP series for adults.  They're wonderfully mysterious, charming and thoroughly uplifting stories of good versus evil.  I read book 4 in two days... just couldn't put it down.  Rowlings' references to mythological and literary images shouldn't be missed.  During the limited breaks I was able to takefrom reading, I found myself re-evaluating the various plot twists and probable red-herrings.  I can't wait for book 5; unfortunately, it isn't anticipated until Fall/Winter 2001.
