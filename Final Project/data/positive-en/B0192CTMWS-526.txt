There are so many hyperventilating reviews here already, I'm going to point out what, for me, were OOP's main flaws.<br /> Harry's angst. Snape was the only one who gave it right back to him consistently. And although his teachers - and sheesh Hogwarts had more than its fair share of horrible ones - were far from likeable either, I found myself occasionally siding with them (though not Professor Umbridge).<br />But while he was over the top, it seemed like Hermione has managed to morph into a serene, wise-beyond-her-years teenager - which is just plain unrealistic. Hermione and Ginny are young teens, regardless if girls are more mature than boys, they just seemed a bit too able to rise to every challenge with aplomb to be believed.<br />Adverbs. OK, this didn't prevent me from enjoying the book. But there must be five on each page. That adds up. Nobody just speaks, they have to speak calmly, brutally, sadly, shortly, etc. This occurred so regularly, that it was easy not to be distracted by them.<br />It also seemed like Rowling was determined that every character from a previous volume make a cameo appearance - from Dobby to Lockhart. While I appreciated this, at times I wished I could just learn more about the main characters like Neville. He'd disappear for pages and then Bam! there he was doing great at his defense lessons or visiting his parents at St. Mungo. Given that he's suffered similarly to Harry, it would be nice to see them contrasted more. (While Harry explodes, Neville implodes.)<br />But OOPS is still a remarkable book. It has the endlessly zany parade of characters - like Oz, the symbols that resonate with universal meeting - like Narnia, and the sly snide humor of Roald Dahl's books. And qualities that are uniquely its own. In short, it works.
