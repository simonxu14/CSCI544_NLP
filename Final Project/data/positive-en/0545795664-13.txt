I bought this book after my 7 year old son begged me for it after seeing it at the book fair at school. He reads it all the time...he has post if flags hanging out all over it to keep all the &#34;important&#34; pages handy. I personally am confused by the whole Pokemon thing, but from the perspective of my 7 year old son, this is the best book! So if you kid is a Pokemon fan, this book is great!
