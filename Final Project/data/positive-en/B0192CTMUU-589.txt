After book 3, I was hoping that the next in the Harry Potter series would re-invigorate the series. While &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; was a good book, it seemed that there was a definite formula developing that was  making Harry's adventures less exciting. Well, I'm happy to say that  &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; lived up to my  expectations! Even the book cover lets you know that J.K. Rowling is going  to shake things up at the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. I  won't reveal too many details, but in this one Harry faces his biggest  challenge(s) yet! While the book is not overtly scary I guess parents  should be warned that it is, so far at least, the darkest of the series -  and Harry is forced to face some pretty grim situations and upsetting  consequences. But I don't think it's anything a kid couldn't handle,  especially since the lessons Harry learns are ones that we all must face  sooner or later. As with the rest of the series, I would highly reccomend  that parents read this book out loud to their children. Harry's adventures  are one of those  rare feats that truly can involve all age groups equally.  And, as someone who very fondly remembers the nights when my father used to  read to my sisters and I, I can assure you that this is exactly the sort of  thing that we would have loved to have shared.
