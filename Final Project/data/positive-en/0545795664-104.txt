This book is my daughter's favorite. It has all of the information one could possibly need about every Pokemon known. It is easy to read and understand and the breakdown is user friendly. This is actually the 2nd copy I have purchased because after two years of carrying her first copy around pages started falling out. It was worth it for the price to re-purchase it and my 10 year old couldn't be happier.
