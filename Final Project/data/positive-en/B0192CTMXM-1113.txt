There has been much talk of disappointment surrounding the protrayal of Harry as a "sullen, moody, spoiled teenager."<br />I will beg to differ and offer the thought that the portrayal of Harry in "Order of the Phoenix" is the most realistic portrait that could be drawn of this character.<br />Here's why, and I'll try to keep spoilers out for those of you who have not read the book:<br />At the end of book four, Harry thought he was winning the Wizard competition with his friend, Cedric.  They just had this great bonding moment and decided to share a victory for their school after months of hard work.  Instead, touching the disguised portkey teleported them into a graveyard where Cedric was killed by the Avara Kadavara curse, and Harry was almost sacrificed by the Death Eaters to resurrect Voldemort.<br />Now, excuse me for being obtuse, but dontcha think this is pretty horrifying and traumatic?  Harry sees his friend die, almost gets brutally murdered himself, witnesses the rebirth of the man who murdered his parents, thereby ushering in what looks to be an apocalyptic future of evil.<br />In the beginning of Book 5, Harry has had no word from any of the Wizarding world about the return of Voldemort.  He's chomping at the bit, not understanding why he has to be at the Dursleys' prison, kept incommunicado by order of Dumbledore, and possibly expelled from school for defending himself and his cousin during an attack by the now renegade Dementors.<br />I dunno about you, but I'd be a little moody, too.<br />The first time I read this book (the day it came out), I was disappointed, too.  With the release of the third movie, I have gone back and read all 5 books, and I can say, honestly, that this Harry is a natural progression - an understandable change in personality considering all the events that have passed in his life.<br />Add to this some fantastic characterizations of his former nemesis, Snape and a startlingly accurate portrayal of a governing body that refuses to acknowledge the real enemy but prefers to demonize dissent and protest, (I'm surprised JKR didn't call Umbridge's rules the Wizarding Patriot Act) and you have quite a mature piece of work.<br />Good job by Rowling, and well worth the read if one can distance one's self from expectation and simply experience the story as it unfolds.
