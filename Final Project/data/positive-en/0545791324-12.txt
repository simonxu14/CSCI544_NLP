Beautiful artwork as expected. I can't wait for the rest of the collection. I will say that Amazon.com so far has the best pricing on this book but BEWARE the packaging. My copy came with the &#34;Harry Potter&#34; foil lettering scratched and in one spot scratched off completely. Some might not care but when the hardcover is just plain the dust jacket becomes just as important as protecting the inside pages.
