This is probably the 6th time I have read this book. It is my favorite. The characters are wonderfully developed by J.K. Rowling. She fills them out and makes them real. I don't care if you are six or 106, you will certainly enjoy your entry into Harry Potter's world and want to return over and over again. Happy reading and safe travels.
