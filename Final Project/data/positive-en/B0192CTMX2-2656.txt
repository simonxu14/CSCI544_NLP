I enjoyed this book. Rowling's a wonderful story teller and I am greatful for these books. However, getting to the end, I couldn't help but wish this was the final book in the series. Like Harry, I was getting tired of it all. I wanted resolution, closure. It's like a slasher movie where the villian gets killed and keeps coming back, again and again and again...
