J.K. Rowling continues to surprise and delight in the third of the Harry Potter series.  There is something for everyone in Harry's story, i.e., fantasy, mystery, sports, adventure.  Each time readers think they  understand Harry's past, Rowling puts another wrinkle into the fabric and  forces a reexamination of the situation.  Great books to teach character  development and point of view.
