The copy I received has Stephen Fry reading instead of Jim Dale which was a wonderful surprise as we are big fans of Stephen Fry from Jeeves and Wooster. He does a marvelous job reading a wonderful book. J.K. Rowling really did create an amazing and wonderful world to escape to and Stephen Fry does a wonderful job helping you get there.
