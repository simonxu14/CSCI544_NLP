I love this book and the movie that they made from it.  The Sorcerer's Stone is the most lighthearted of the series.  As you read it you will feel the sense of wonder and excitement that Harry experiences.  Why stop with one, buy the whole series.  You will regret having to wait for the next one if you don't.
