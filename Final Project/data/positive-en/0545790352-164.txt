It's Harry Potter, whats not to like?  The same great story you have read, but now with stunning art included.  Rowling loved this are and so will you.  My wife wanted this as a Christmas present and read it to my daughter.  The pictures will help hold the attention of kids.  Even if you own all the Potter books, this will be a welcome addition to your library.
