There are 800 some odd reviews here about Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, letting everyone know that yes, it is as great as the other books.<br />I just want to take this small amount of space to thank Amazon.com  for doing such an amazing job during the insane rush that occurred during  this books release. With what was rapidly approaching half-a-MILLION orders  placed to Amazon.com for this book, I expected to wait a long time to get  it (the price made it worth it, though!). To my incredible surprise, my  order was shipped the very next day, and the shipping was upgraded to 2nd  day at no extra charge. I have never received better service from an online  store, and I only wish that I had used Amazon.com for my Xmas shopping last  year (instead of another site that didn't sent my items out for a month  &lt;ahem, there UGO&gt;).<br />I didn't see anywhere else to praise  Amazon.com, so what better place than to do it here. This is truly my  unbiased opinion as a regular shopper and reviewer. I hope staying  anonymous emphasizes that.<br />Thanks for the great service, Amazon.com! Now,  back to my book...
