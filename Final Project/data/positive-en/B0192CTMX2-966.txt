It's always a worry when you start on a 7 book journey...Will all the books be good?  Will they all grab my interest?  Will the last one end properly, so that I don't feel like I wasted my money?  I for one, can say that I think it ended quite properly, and it was satisfying and warm and wonderful.  Everything is so clever and well thought out, you can tell that not only has JK Rowling grown up as a writer but has considered the fate of her characters carefully and lovingly.  An excellent book.  Very few people in this world will be dissapointed with this wonderful ending to a great and clever story.
