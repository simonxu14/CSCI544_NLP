Goodbye... Dear, Harry. I, and everyone else will miss you terribly.<br />As if you were really real, too. That's saying a lot since, it is hard to think of you as fictional. It is also hard to think that this is the end...who or what will replace such fine writing as this? My readers heart is surely broken and no magic can fix it. What a thrill ride it has been for all ages and not just children. Cheers to you, Harry.
