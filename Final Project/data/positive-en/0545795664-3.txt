I was pleasantly surprised when I pulled this out of the box! It is so much nicer than I had expected it to be. I thought for the price I'd be getting a thin little book with a few Pokemon in it. What I got was a nice, thick, book full of good quality pages listing tons of different Pokemon. The layout of the pages is perfect, nicely organized and easy to use as a reference or for younger kids who are still getting the hang of reading. Great price on this! A must buy for any special Pokemon fans in your life. The excitement on my daughter's face when she saw it said it all. Highly recommended!
