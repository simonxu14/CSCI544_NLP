I purchased this for my child who is a Pokemon fan.  He loves this handbook because it shows all the Pokemons from the Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, and Kalos regions.  This handbook is very colorful and gives you stats on the different Pokemons.  It shows what each Pokemon can evolve into.  It tells you how to pronounce each Pokemon, as well.  Also, it even shows you their new power called Mega Evolution.  Great purchase for my little Pokemon fan!
