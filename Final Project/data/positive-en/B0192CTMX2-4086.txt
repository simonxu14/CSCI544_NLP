I am not a foaming-mouthed Potter fan, though I like the series. I only just read it last year. I started in Dec '06 and finished when the new book came out. In fact, I read books 4,5,6 and 7 in like one month (For a slow reader like me this took a miracle. Either that or a few slow days at work....heh heh, ah it's the American way....)<br /><br />Book seven is fantastic. It is far and away the best book in the series. Rowling seals the deal with the most intricate plot, the biggest battles, and the most spectacular surprises. If you haven't read this book by now you probably never will. Either that or you live on Saturn and your Amazon shipment is only now arriving...
