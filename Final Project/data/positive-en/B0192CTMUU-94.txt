I've read this book so many times I needed to buy this book to replace the one that was falling apart. 5/5 stars for Rowling. This is the fourth installment of the Harry Potter series, which includes a lot of trying times and enemies disguised as friends. In this book, Harry is entered into the Triwizard Tournament despite the age restrictions, and spends the whole year trying to stay alive through the three tasks. Towards the end there is a terribly surprising plot twist that will shock the unwary reader right out of their seat. Will not bore you, that's for sure.
