This one starts out slowly and you need to hang in there and trust the author.  It picks up slowly, and things start to fall into place.  Finally, the ending comes and it's so worth it.  Very good, and sets up the next two really well.  I'd say the 3rd and 4th are the best, but this one is better than 1 and 2.
