Less than 24 hours after getting it, I'm finished.  I did NOT want to stop reading. I will NOT give away what happens to Harry.  I will not tell what the death count will be. I will say that this book was a phenomenal read. It was a rocking, no holds barred race of amazing adventures.  I laughed and cried my way through this book to an end that was fantastically satisfying.  Rowling outdid herself.  There is no way anyone could be disappointed in this book.
