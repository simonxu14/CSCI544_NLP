This book it great! We got it for the kids since they have been interested in the different types of Pokemon after Pokemon Go came out. The Pokemon are listed in alphabetical order, and it will show you what it evolved from or what it can evolve into, what type of Pokemon it is, as well as a description, it's attacks, and how to pronounce the name. It does not, however, tell you which generation of Pokemon it is.
