I am returning this book for the SECOND time.  Both times I've ordered it, it has been advertised as a hardback book. It is nothing like the other books in the series, it has no jacket, the cover looks digitized, the paper is poor quality and cut on an angle at the top of the page so the writing slants up to the right.  It is not a classic hardcover book, it looks like a cheap knockoff.  Perhaps it is a library binding, I'm not sure what those are, I always order hardcovers.  Hardcover Harry Potters are especially important for my son, since I am reading them to him in hopes that he'll keep them and read them again when he is older.  So, now I'm headed to Barnes & Nobles to purchase a decent copy with two shopping days before Christmas. Someone at Amazon hasn't done their homework.  Buy this book, but don't buy the hardcover from Amazon!
