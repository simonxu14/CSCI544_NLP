It's hard to believe that J. K. Rowling keeps getting better, but she does.  The latest addition to the Harry Potter series was a real page turner and an absolute joy to read.  My only disappointment as I read was in knowing that once I finished the book, it might be years before another Harry Potter adventure hit the stores.<br />In this latest installment of the series, Harry squares off against dementors, a truly hateful Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, a giant, deatheaters, and, once again, Voldemort.  New characters are introduced; familiar characters are fleshed out and given much more depth.  We witness not only the clash of muggle and magical worlds, but Harry's struggle to cope with what he does and doesn't know about his parents, his godfather, his aunt and uncle, Dumbledore, Lord Voldemort, and even himself.<br />Harry and friends are growing older and wiser.  Thanks, Jo Rowling, for letting us share their lives.
