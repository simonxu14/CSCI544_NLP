I suppose I'm torn on if I like this book or not. My 7-year-old saved up to buy it two months ago, the pages keep falling out because she uses it constantly...so I suppose I should give the quality 1 star. However, it belongs to a 7-year-old who uses it constantly...like every day. So perhaps it really is on par with other normal quality books.<br /><br />That being said. She has been begging me to buy another one and since 7-year-olds don't have all that much money I'm buying this one for her and she will give the other to her older siblings who use it when ever she's not. I have given them a binder clip to keep the fallen-out pages together, they are happy with that.
