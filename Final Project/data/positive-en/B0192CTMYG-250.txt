It has been 15 years since this novel was first published, but I never get tired of listening to the narrator Jim Dale, perform this story. he can do the voice of an old man named Dumbledore with as much I ease and pose as he does 11 year old Hermione. If you have never listened to this story on audio book, you will not be disappointed by this one!
