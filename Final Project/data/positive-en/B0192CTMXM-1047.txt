It arrived yesterday via Fedex (thanks Amazon!) and I finished reading it today. The first 500 pages were sort of slow, but the last 350 pages were the best ever! Outstanding! Harry's pain was my pain, was the pain of all of us who lost someone we love or go have our talents go unrecognized. And Dumbledore's explanation of why these things happen was the only explanation that would ever help.  JK Rowling, please don't make me wait 3 more years for the 6th book, and then 3 beyond that  for the 7th -- I need these books while I am still growing up!
