There's enough other reviews on the merits of this book -- (It is excellent and left me wishing book 6 would be out real soon).<br />The one thing I really want to say is that Amazon really shouldn't list it as being for 9 to 12 year olds. It would be better to recommend it for 13 and older. Harry is growing up, he's 15 in this story, and the problems and situations he has to deal with are going of more interest to teens (and adults like me!) than they are for younger kids.
