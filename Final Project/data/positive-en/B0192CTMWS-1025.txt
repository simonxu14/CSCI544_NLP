I have read the books and seen the movie. I bought my first set of audiobooks on a whim. I love them, I listen to them when I am driving. It helps to block out all the frustration from the heavy traffic in southern calif. I don't mind the time it takes to get home anymore. Sometimes I even sit in my car in the garage to hear the end of the chapter. I also pickup on things in the story I missed before. I want all of the Harry Potter books cuz I like listening to them over and over. But there are alot of different books that are audio now. There is even a rental club like netflix.
