NOTE: I strongly implore you to read ALL of the first six Harry Potter books BEFORE you read this one. If you fail to do so, you WILL NOT understand this book.<br /><br />Also, you will want to be a speed-reader to really appreciate the swiftness of some of this book's events. Speed-reading simulates the speed of a movie superbly.<br /><br />This book answered almost all of my questions about the Harry Potter series' characters in a brilliant and witty way. I enjoyed it so much, I almost snarled at people who disturbed me and I stayed up until 3:00 in the morning finishing it.<br /><br />I don't want to go too in-depth about the book because that'd spoil it, but suffice it to say that this book alone is reason enough to read the entire Harry Potter series from start to finish just to appreciate the masterpiece J.K. Rowling has created.
