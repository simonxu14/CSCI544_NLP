We of course have all the other books on CD but didn't have this one. Jim Dayle does such an amazing job reading these books so much so I have hard time just reading the books to myself or the kids. We all want to hear Jim Dayle do the voices. We have every book on CD and have listened to them on our 25 minute drive to and from school as well as long road trips. Best audio books ever!
