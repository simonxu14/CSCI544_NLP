I did not even pick up a Harry Potter book until the third edition and probally wouldn't have if not for a school project my son had to do but from the moment I started reading I couldn't stop and waited very impatiently I might add for the next edition my son lost interest in them preferring to wait for the movies, I did not, as the day for the release of this book (which I preordered the moment it popped up here) I waited both impatiently and with exitement, but also dread at what could happen and the fact that it was the last book and there would be no more waiting for more, so Saturday morning I was waiting at the back door of my post office for the first employee to arrive to get my book as our post office opens late on Saturday and thankfully they gave it to me, I started reading on the way home which was no easy feat as I did not have my glasses, but I just couldn't wait, so I am stumbling down the road reading and I did not stop until I was done, I laughed , I cried and I thouroughly enjoyed my last installment of my favorite book and I know every Harry Potter fan every where will Thank-you J.K. Rowling for the best set of books I have ever read and I am 50 yrs old
