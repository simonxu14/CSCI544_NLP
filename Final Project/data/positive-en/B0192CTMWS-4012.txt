This final installment of the 'Harry Potter' saga was well worth the long wait.  It is full of twists and turns, surprises (both delightful and dark), and a resounding ending that is extremely satisfying.<br />  This last book only makes me want to read the whole series again.<br />  Well done Ms. Rowling!
