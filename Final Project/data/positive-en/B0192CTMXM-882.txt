This is not the best of the Harry Potter books, but it's still darn good.  Every Potter fan should waste no time in getting a copy, just don't read it as fast as I did as then you'll be back to the waiting game.  Waiting for book six that is.<br />All of your favorite characters return, not all survive.  This is not the cheeriest book, but it does have it's moments of humour.  The Weasely boys are sure to be legends at Hogwarts for years to come :)<br />This is a long book, and I wished it were even longer.  There is so much going on, that some characters and locations get only a brief mention.  We are left with a few unanswered questions as always, to set the stage for the next book.  (Just how well does Harry do on his O.W.L.'s)?<br />Hopefully we don't have to wait quite so long for our next fix.<br />Daryl W. Clemens
