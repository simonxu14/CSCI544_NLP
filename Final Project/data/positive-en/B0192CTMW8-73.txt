One of the very best plots but of course all Harry Potter books have incredible plots and outstanding prose.  I like this one as it is early in Harry, Ron's and Herminie's attendance at Hogwarts still young enough to have fun discovery new aspects of the castle and new characters. My favorite line is when Professor Dumbledore (Professor McGonagall in the movie)  says to Ron expecting to be expelled for driving the flying car and damaging the Whomping Willow &#34;Not today, Mr. Wesley&#34;.  It' a great line to use to yourself when you do something wrong, stupid or fail that ends up OK. I have said many, many times to my self.
