Although I am a fantasy fan, I was not interested in reading the Harry Potter books because I saw them as children's fiction.  However, my adult daughter read the series, loved them, and gave me a set of the first 6 books at Christmas.  I started reading because I love her. Boy, was I surprised at how entertaining they were for me.  After the first two books (Harry at ages 11 and 12) the story actually became quite dark and intriging. I purchased the last book from Amazon and was really sorry to say goodbye to the characters when I finished.<br /><br />The books are classic good versus evil with strong messages about the power of love, respect, and kindness, as well as the value of friendship, loyalty, honor and courage, hard work and intelligence. As far as children and young adults, I think the later books could be pretty disturbing in places for kids under 11 or 12, so parents should read with the kids or carefully assess the maturity of the readers.  But a great thing about young people liking these books is that fact that they teach valuable lessons about tolerance, kindness, and inclusiveness towards those who are "different".  With all the bullying in schools and on-line, this is especially important.<br /><br />Having over 3,000 pages to work on the characters was a bonus.  But keeping up the quality of the work over so many years and pages, as Rowling fleshed out her initial vision of how she wanted the story to end is a pretty amazing literary feat.  We have all seen some great series peter out badly.  All in all I am very happy with my Christmas gift. I was skeptical at first, but am truly impressed.
