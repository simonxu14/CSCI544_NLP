My son had this on his wish list for quite some time.  It was well worth the wait.  It has all the Pokemon and their evolved forms you could dream of.  I have even looked at it, to help me better understand this Pokemon world he loves so much.  The pages are in full color which is really great.  My son is 6 and looks at this daily.
