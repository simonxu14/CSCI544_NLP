All in all another excellent pageturner from JK Rowling. Engaging and exciting, I read it all in an 9 hr sitting! It's not quite the kind of rollicking adventure of the previous books and isn't something I would advise for kids younger than 10 unless they're very mature. Harry is turning into an adult and the pressures and sadness of his life are starting to show. In a way, it's about time our favorite wizard was less than his quiet self. I know I'd have a temper with even half he's been through.<br />A lot more of a downbeat story, this book manages to be good even though the heroes are suffering. What's good; Harry's characterization, general writing and storytelling.<br />What's bad; a more convoluted plot that's confusing even to me, an adult, sometimes and that Mrs. Umbridge. I wanted to kick her!<br />But I still cared about Harry, Dumbledore, Hermione, Ron and everyone else and I can't wait for the next book or to read it again. If you're a fan, you'll love it! If you're new to the series, start with anyone of the other books first.
