This selection was just about perfect from timeliness of service to packaging to being as represented. I had read the book but the Jim Dale recording added life and interest to the story and the characters. The vendor shipped promptly and the title was indeed like new. I enjoyed the title and the service and will certainly buy from this vendor again when a title I want is offered.
