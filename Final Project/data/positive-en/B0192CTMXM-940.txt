I felt this book could have been better edited to create a more seamless storyline; there were times I felt the prose was a bit rambly and not particularly pertinent to the story.  However, I am so impressed by JK Rowling's ability to really engage all ages of readers and to have young children excited about reading the book.<br />Harry is DEFINITELY a teenager!  JK did a great job of capturing the angst and anger.  Younger kids may not quite be able to relate to that aspect.<br />Looking forward to the next one!
