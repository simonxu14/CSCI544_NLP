This is a wonderful addition to any HP lover's collection!  While one of the best in the series, this Deluxe Edition is a beautiful copy of JKR's magnum opus.  I've personally left mine in the packaging.  I am going to continue to watch for sales and hopefully get copies of all 7 books in their Deluxe Editions....and no longer worry about the possibility of ruining my copies when I read them!
