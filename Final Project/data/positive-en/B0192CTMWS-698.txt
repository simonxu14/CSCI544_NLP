In each of the preceding Harry Potter novels, JKR introduced us to new characters and plotlines.  In Order of the Phoenix, few of the major characters are new [with the notable exception of the vile, pink-sweater-wearing-headmistress-wannabe Delores Umbridge] and she explores more deeply some of the old themes and characters. To my delight, some of the familiar characters emerge as unlikely heroes.  My heart soared as the defiant Fred and George Weasley flew away on their brooms to realize entrepreneurial success.  And Neville fighting Lord Voldemort alongside Harry -- who knew?  Hermione, of course, has always been my favorite.  Her quickly devised plan to introduce Umbridge to the Centaurs was brilliant!!  Many of themes in this novel left me feeling unsatisfied -- Harry's relationship with Cho Chang, being an example.  And really, he should appreciate by now that Snape is not his enemy.  In fact, Harry was not very likeable in this installment.  Self-absorbed, unnecessarily defiant, moody.  A byproduct of the teenage years, I suppose.  Still, JKR has achieved another imaginative, compelling story that I recommend to anyone who loves the basic literary device of good triumphing over evil.
