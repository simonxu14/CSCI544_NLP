To a wonderful series. There is something so satisfying and yes a bit sad in finishing something that has been with you for ten years. Luckily Rowling does not disappoint, and wraps up the tale of Harry with finesse and brilliance. I'd rather not say anything about the plot and just say again how lucky we've all been to experience a series that has broken records and will go down in history as superb classics.
