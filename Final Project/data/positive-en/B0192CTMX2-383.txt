Jim Dale is a wonderful performer for the HP series. I have all of the audio books. Or rather, I had them all before I loaned them out and never got them back-- that's how good these are. He has voices for each character and he clearly puts thought behind his work. When someone is supposed to be eating/yawning while talking he mimics it. This is well worth buying and listening to. McGonagall alone is worth the price. (Get the early books and listen to her scolding "Jordon") You really picture what is going on.
