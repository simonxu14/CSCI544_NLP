Another brilliant continuation of an incredible story. I am 65 years old and reading these books has truely been a highlight of my life. I have seen all the films many times, but never with the depth of understanding I now have. I really can't find any thing negitive to say. If you loved the Harry Potter movies your joy will be magnified ten fold by reading the whole series. The order Of The Phoenix does not disappoint.
