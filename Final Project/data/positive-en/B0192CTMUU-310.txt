I just completed this book and already cannot wait for the next one. This may sound strange coming from someone my age-you see, i am 34 yrs. old. But this author is an exceptional writer and is able to entrance even the  oldest of the young.  I recommend it for any reader who loves  a good  story.  Parents--buy this book for your children, heck, buy it for  yourselves!
