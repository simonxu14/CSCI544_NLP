I read this book aloud to my family (with 2 children) over a period of two weeks.  I have done this many times before with other books but never have they wanted me to keep going and going and not stop.  As soon as we finished, my 11 year-old daughter had to read it for herself.<br />Just why  this book has become such a phenomenon is not hard to see.  The story  appeals to all of us, no matter what our age.  The suspenseful parts have  just the right amount to keep us on the edge of our seats; the humor is  perfectly-timed; the emotional portions are exquisite.  All of the  technical aspects of a fiction novel for older children are here.<br />But  that is not why it is so wonderful.  The character of Harry Potter, I  believe, triumphs over a situation in which we can all see ourselves.  His  background is one we can relate to, even if it exaggerates our own  predicaments (just as our own memories are).  His progress through the  story just makes us want to cheer.  All of the characters are  multi-dimensional and impossible to predict, constantly suprising us, and  yet the whole ensemble merges together like a world class symphony.<br />If  you haven't read this book yet, don't wait any longer.  It is not often  that we get to witness the birth of a classic.
