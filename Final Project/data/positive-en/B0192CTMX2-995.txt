It's an amazing book with a great conclusion that still left my family wanting more, more, more.  What were the characters careers now? Who is headmaster at Hogwarts?  What happened to some of our favorite Hogwarts teachers?  What happened to the Dursleys?<br /><br />We loved the book so much and were amazed at Rowlings ability to pull everything together in such a flawless manner;it makes us want to go back and read the first 6 for things we missed the first time that were referred to in this book.<br /><br />Thank you J.K. for giving us the magic of Harry Potter.  You have given my family a piece of literature to enjoy together again and again.
