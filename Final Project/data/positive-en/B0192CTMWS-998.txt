I received number 5 by owl delivery from Amazon the day it was released and started reading right away.  I put the book down only to pick it back up Aug 3/03.  Although I found it easy the first time to put down, once I started reading again I couldn't part with it.  J.K. Rowling is a brilliant writer.  I will admit that Harry's anger was starting to get on my nerves however, it makes sense in the end.  Like Albus Dumbledore, I had forgotten what it's like to be a teenager.  I'm a late HP fan.  I only started reading the series when number 4 came out.  I read them all within 1 week!  Thanks J.K. Rowling for sharing your talent.
