I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.  It's the best book in the series, better than Prizoner of Azkaban.  I was angry with & at Harry.  I laughed out loud.  I cried for the last 30 pages.  It was a reminder of what it was like to be 15 but under extraordinary circumstances.  I only hope that the 6th book doesn't take as long as this one to reach the stores.  I can't wait for it.  I also hope that Ms. Rowling doesn't cash in on this series & keep writing about Harry after his 7th year.  I think Harry & the crew from Hogwarts fate is best left to the imagination.
