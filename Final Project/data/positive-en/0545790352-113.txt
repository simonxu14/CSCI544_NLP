I cannot say enough about how happy we are with this edition, and truly can't wait for the rest of the books!  Our seven year old was literally shaking with anticipation when I opened the box and immediately sat down and started reading.<br /><br />The book is huge!  The text is in column formatting on the page which I enjoy and allows for even larger illustration.  The text is in traditional English instead of Americanized so you'll see neighbour rather than neighbor for example.  Though every page is not illustrated they are more frequent than I'd expected.
