Harry Potter's continuing journey to manhood in Book 4 is Rowling's most detailed canvas yet.  She paints a more richly-colored world in which the characters which we have come to know and love reveal much more about  themselves (and others reveal about them - a new character, a Hedda  Hopper-like journalist who has a penchant for trashing her subjects), as a  result of which we are all better prepared for the inevitable conflicts to  come.  We get to know the Weasleys better than ever; important facts about  Dumbledore, Snape, the Death Eaters, Voldemort and others are revealed and  woven more deeply into the fabric of the life of Harry Potter and his  growing up.  The book is long only because the story is richly detailed.  The details are essential I am sure, not only for the plot in Book 4, but  as a foundation for the last three stories.  Long, however, does not mean  boring . . . in fact, the opposite.  Harry's latest year at Hogwarts is his  most challenging yet.  The book champions teamwork, loyalty, moral fiber,  self-sacrifice and courage.  A wonderful book that deserves quiet  reflection from its readers, and a more slowly paced re-read.
