EDIT:  Some people mark audio reviews as "unhelpful", which I found strange, until I realized what Amazon does.<br />--  They pool audio and text reviews and place all of those reviews on each of the products' pages, regardless of form the material is taking.  You wouldn't expect a book review on the DVD's page.  In this case, every word is the same, but a book review tells you only about the story, not the quality of the audio product.<br />--  But any regular audiobook listener has experienced a great book poorly read, or hammed up, or a voice that grated on your nerves, or found a book you loved to listen to, but couldn't find the time to sit and read (Lord of the Rings for me).<br />--  A review of the author's work tells you NOTHING about the audio, and yet, if you try and find what you're getting into, you have to sift through MANY book reviews before finding out the quality of the voice work, as most people have reviewed the author and the book, rather than the audiobook.<br />--  So, here's a small review of the audiobook, if you're interested in purchasing that.  If you're looking for a review of the author, I am not being unhelpful, but Amazon is.  I will request that they change their policy and display the reviews separately.<br /><br />... Jim Dale is one of the best voice actors I've ever listened to and he brought the books to life an a way that reading could never do.  I like reading, but it's really incredible to have someone put a different voice to every character, displaying the emotions and tone of the interactions.<br />... They are a really phenomenal experience, and I've listened to them over again and again.
