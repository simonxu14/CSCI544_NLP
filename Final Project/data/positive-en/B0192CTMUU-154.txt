We all know the Harry Potter books are amazing. However, this review is about the appearance of the books rather than the contents.<br />I recently decided to complete my HP paperback collection. I originally read all of the books in hardcover but I had bought a few in paperback years ago because they're easier to throw in my purse and carry around.<br />When I went to the store to buy the rest of the books in paperback I found that they had redone the whole collection when they released the complete set. I don't know why they decided to replace the back cover art with a blank background and change the multicolored argyle spines to monochrome, but I think it takes away from the personality of the books.<br />So I had been going all over town in search of the original prints. I was lucky to find an original CoS behind a stack of reprints at a Meijer but that was it. Imagine my happiness when I went on Amazon and saw that the product description for GoF said 2002 edition and the "search through the book" showed the original print with the back cover art. (I also ordered OotP - same story there.) However, when it arrived, IT WAS THE DREADED REPRINT EDITION. Of course, they let me return it, but I was very heartbroken and disappointed. Amazon let me down for the first time.<br /><br />So, for those who love and enjoy the full art of the HP books, you will be thoroughly disappointed with this version. Good luck with your search for first edition!
