Run-ons are a pet peeve of mine, but aside from that, the book had enough action, personal drama, etc etc to keep me entertained.  Rowling does dialogue very well.  The characters came alive with all their flaws and petty tiffs.<br />Probably the best part of the book and the Harry Potter series as a whole is I can believe in the character.  I can believe he's got his burden to bear and does that at times with ill grace.  He's a teen, struggling with life and love and friendship.  He's also human, so he fails and triumphs.<br />The twists in the book are excellent.  Hearty thanks to Rowling for sticking in that "I'll explain all" ch, b/c I did not bother rereading the entire series b/f jumping into the 7th.  Maybe one day I'll read 'em all again, but for now, excellent read, well worth the buy.  Long live Potter!
