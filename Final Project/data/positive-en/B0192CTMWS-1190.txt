I grew up reading all the OZ books, and read them repeatedly. And could read them all again.  I have now read all three of these books twice over in the space of 2 months.  Never thought I'd find tales and characters that  captured me like this.  The magic she creates in our minds, the images, the  characters - all make you wish you could attend Hogwarts, too.  Great  reading for all ages.
