This is a book, and series, you can read over and over again. This was a great ending to me series, with much more details than the movies provide. Very well written, makes you want to keep reading....very hard to put down! The book itself and the book art are good quality, very sturdy and will last for years to come. Don't hesitate to purchase this addition to your library.
