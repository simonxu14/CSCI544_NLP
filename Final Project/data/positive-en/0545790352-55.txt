I had previously read the books and watched the movies so the storyline is not this review.  It is a great and amazingly well thought out storyline though if these are new to you.<br />But this review is this particular book and the newly added illustrations.  All over the book just felt like it was very high quality and a lot of thought had been put into it.  The book is sized more like a &#34;coffee table&#34; book, so pretty large.  This was actually nice for me as it had a more substantial feel to it.  I also imagine it is prefect size to be reading to kids one day in the future. The illustrations were nice but not too overwhelming, they left you plenty of room for your imagination.  Also as many other reviewers mentioned, even the pages without illustrations had a parchment like design to make them look streamlined with the rest of the book.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a long time Harry Potter fan or this is your very first Harry Potter book I think you will be very happy with this purchase.
