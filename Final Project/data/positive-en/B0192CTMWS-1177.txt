I have repeatedly listened to all the Harry Potter audio book sets as performed by Jim Dale, and they are all excellent.  Mr. Dale has a unique voice for each character, and they are all very recognizable. I especially enjoy Mr. Dale's voice acting of Dobbie, Hagrid, Dumbledore and Snape.<br /><br />These are great for enjoying the world of Harry Potter universe while doing other things such as driving or working.
