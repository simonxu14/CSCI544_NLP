Little disappointed. I don't like it when the seller doesn't state weather it has the dust jacket or not and its a long and hard guessing game to try and find one that does. Book had minor stains and dents on the cover but I expected that seeing as I was buying used. I bought all the hard cover books off of amazon of the Harry Potter series. Not a single one of the sellers stated that it was missing the dust jacket and 6 out of the 7 books came with them. Buyer beware if you want one with the dust jacket contact the seller and ask first.
