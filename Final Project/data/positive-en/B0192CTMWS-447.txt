I've been waiting a long time for this story to end. And it finally has.<br /><br />The story was fairly good till the end when it seemed like it was more like something you might see in a movie than imagine through a book, but I found it interesting.<br /><br />I recommend it for anyone who has read the other 6 Harry Potter books. (obviously)
