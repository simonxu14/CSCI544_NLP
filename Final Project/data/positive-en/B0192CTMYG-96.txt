Okay, so children's literature is not my usual thing to read.  But when two computer people, including one PhD in computer engineering, and a cardiovascular-transplant surgeon all &quot;admitted&quot; to being addicted to the Harry Potter books, I decided maybe there was something to them.  I read this, the first, and I have to &quot;admit&quot; there is!  I found the central character Harry Potter and his friends entirely believable, despite their rather unusual milleu.  The story was well written and carefully plotted and was not as treacley as I'd expected it to be.  In fact it was quite charming, included some rather intense real-life topics--such as the unfairness of life in general and the death of parents in particular--and kept my attention well enough for me to read it in under a day's time.  I'd recommend it to anyone.
