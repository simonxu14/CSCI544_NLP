My daughter, a teacher and mother of my first grandchild, encouraged me to read the Harry Potter series so when the youngster is of the reading-to age, I would be prepared.  To that end, she gave me the entire set.  Beginning at the beginning, I opened the Sorcerer's Stone and became hooked.  This is great stuff, and as a senior citizen I highly recommend it for the ubiquitous children "of all ages."  I can see why it takes Ms. Rowling so long to write one of these adventures:  It must take months to come up with all the delightful names of people and objects and to create the wizardry world of Hogwarts (see what I mean about names!), plus the traditions and games and history of this other world.  And yes, even though it is fantasy, I predict you will be caught up in the spells she weaves.  This is a book of mini-adventures, which - except for the principal mystery - conclude within a few fast-moving pages.  I believe this is an important factor to keep children interested.  There is suspense and some scary stuff, but most of it is over in a paragraph or two.  And there's humor that kids will laugh out loud at.  This is a book that is populated with great characters that children can identify with.  They range from Harry, the put-upon orphan who becomes a hero, to Hermione the bookish girl who earns her place among the boys, to Neville the diminutive lad who just naturally lags behind as he is constantly looking for his lost toad.  There's even Hagrid, a gentle, and not too smart, giant.  If you've got a child about nine who won't be motivated to read, I suggest you just leave a couple of these Potter books lying around without comment.  Chances are good that the child might just pick one up, after all Harry is totally awesome among the young set.  Once reaching the second page, the child will forget about the fact he/she "hates to read."
