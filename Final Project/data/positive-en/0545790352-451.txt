This book is exquisite and 100% worth the purchase.  The illustration are full page watercolors done in incredible detail and enhance the story reading process.<br /><br />However I had similar difficulty as a reviewer below that when amazon shipped they just put the book in a cardboard box and much of the gold lettering on the cover scraped off as a result. Amazon, please shrink wrap this book before shipping!
