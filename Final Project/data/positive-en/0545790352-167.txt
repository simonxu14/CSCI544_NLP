So I had a bit of a blonde moment when I ordered this product.  I was looking for Harry Potter options for my daughter's 11th Harry Potter birthday/party.  We purchased the US version as a Christmas gift, as I was scrolling through (to my defense I think it was late at night), I saw this and only paying attention to the cover saw it was different and was thinking I was ordering the second book (maybe it was released earlier in the UK since that is where this was coming from).  Obviously I was incorrect and this is the UK version (my own fault no issue in the listing).  I would not have normally ordered this however I am glad I oops'ed, my kids enjoyed seeing the slight difference of wording and since we are all Harry Potter fans there is no such thing as too many Harry Potter books in the house.<br /><br />As with the US version, the illustrations are great.  My avid reader (who flew through the whole series) enjoyed reading these again and this format made my not as much of a book worm son more likely to tackle the series since it includes the illustrations.
