After reading the other 6, this one fell a little flat. Gone was the humor that ran through the others. Missing was the epic battle at the end (I really felt the end battle was lame and a let down). And the epilogue at the end? Didn't really tie things up for me or leave me feeling satisfied. After so many years following these characters and growing to love them, this was just a let down. Still good-but had I started with this one I wouldn't have been impressed with the storyline or the writing.
