My opinon of this book is twisted. How did I managed to give this book five stars when it is the series' installment I most complained about?  There are aspects so brilliant they make up for any flaw I might find--the second reading allowed me to see the reason behind these so-called flaws.  The book is startling as an almost 180 degree flip from the cute, wonderlandish feel of the prior books, something I originally found disturbing.<br />And yet the disturbing quality is good.  It's necessary as J. K. Rowling explores the world outside a child's fantasy.  Some may complain, but Harry is growing up--I found his whiney attitude considerably mild in comparison with the many angst-ridden teens I've seen.  Considering all that Harry has been through, I'd be more disturbed had he acted naturally.  And let's remember that many teenagers do read these books--they need someone to connect with.<br />And connect teenagers should.  The dark world that is this book is the twisted mutations of many things familiar to a teenager.  The ultimate sinister teacher is embodied in Umbridge who, if examined, is morbidly evil in an even soulless way.  Even tests are hyperbolized fantastically.  Wild, enchanting, and over-the-top: I like it.<br />I feel J. K. has even improved in her writing.  Tight, quick, description paints an incredible world beyond the now-familiar Hogwarts.  It's a pivot:  the once-strange school has become safe to readers, so Rowling takes them beyond it into the wide wizarding world.<br />This is an excellent fantasy, dark and rich and wonderful.
