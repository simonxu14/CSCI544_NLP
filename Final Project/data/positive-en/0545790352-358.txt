Wow. Just wow. I picked this up for my wife, who is generally not a reader at all (she's never read the books herself, only had them read to her) and she thought this was the coolest ever! The wonderful art not only helps keep her attention, it also helps her find her place again in the book. I can't wait for the rest of the series to come out in this format.
