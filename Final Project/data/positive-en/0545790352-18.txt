I'll start by saying that I've been a fan of Harry Potter ever since the first edition of the Sorcerers Stone was gifted to me when I was in the fourth grade.<br /><br />Now that I'm 25 and have read the series many times over every couple of years, these new illustrated editions are a great way to read the series again.  As one can see from the photographs I've provided, the art is very well done -- it seems to have been drawn by someone who appreciates the story and the mental images it creates and aids the reader in viewing the world JK Rowling built.<br /><br />The book itself is very sturdy with nice thick pages and a very attractive look.  This book will serve as the book I will read and keep on the coffe table and in reach of curious guests, while the more expensive collectors edition that is to be released later in the year will go to the bookshelf.
