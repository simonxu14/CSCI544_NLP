No spoilers in my review, but watch out reading the rest of these reviews, there are some serious spoilers here!<br />Now, for the book, it's not a "fun" read like the first four, Harry is struggling on several fronts, and it shows throughout the book. But still it's brilliant, Harry really came alive for me, so many times I wanted to reach out and shake some sense into him! And the Weasley twins were absolutely fantastic!
