JK does not disappoint in this final book. Darker than the rest but shows how much Harry and his friends have grown. It made me want to read the whole series again. (Which I did:-) I was thrilled with the way she strung together all the bits and peices that were mentioned here and there in the previous book. She did a good job of balancing everything out to make a grand finale.
