Let me add my voice to all of the other readers who love HP5. I would rank it among the rarest of reads for this reason: I've been savoring the novel for some time now, have finally come to the final chapter, and I'm reluctant to read it because I don't want the novel to end. It IS as good as I, and many others, have said. I look forward to the next book in the series and can only hope that it's as well-crafted, complex, and enjoyable a read as this entry has been. Reading HP5 has been an exceptional experience.
