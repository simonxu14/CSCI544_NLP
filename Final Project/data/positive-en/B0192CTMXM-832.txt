I just finished read this book.  It is darker in tone than the previous ones.  At first, this is hard to read--I wanted the powerful wizards to live in their happy, funny world.  However, the wizards are afraid, angry, disappointed, hurt, and their feelings influence them to be short-tempered and misunderstand each other.  Despite all their talents and powers, the wizards are frightened; peace and harmony are hard to find when evil is disrupting every aspect of the Wizarding world.<br />This books is wonderful.  Ms. Rowling's writing skills get better and better with each book.  She has given the characters a greater span of emotional responses as each one matures towards adulthood--grownup and child alike.<br />I gave this book five stars but that really isn't enough to indicate how great this book is.  Buy this book.  Read this book.  You will not be disappointed...now, excuse me, I have to go read it again.
