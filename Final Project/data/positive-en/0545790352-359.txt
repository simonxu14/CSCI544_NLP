As a long time Harry Potter fan, I love to collect all things having to do with the books.  This illustrated edition had few pictures than I anticipated, but it turns out to be just the right amount to compliment the story I love.  They leave enough to the imagination that the magic (no pun intended) is still there.  The illustrations are complimentary to the story instead of telling the story.  I love it!  My 5 year old also loves it, and I think that having a visualization of what we are reading now and then throughout the book helps to hold his interest.
