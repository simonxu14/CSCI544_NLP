I will try not to give any spoilers...I read my copy in less than 24 hours mainly because I was paranoid I would go to check my email and see an internet review titled "Harry Lives!" or "Harry Dies!"  Don't let the lack of stars fool you this was a very good book.  Most of the 1 stars are from people mad at Amazon for not getting them their book on time...That's right, they haven't even read the book!  A lot of the other reviews are disgusted with the "sex and language".  Sex!  Come on! You must have read a different book than I.  The main characters are now 17 they are no longer 11.  They are also fighting for their lives and should be forgiven a few "bloody"s  and "effing"s!  I am hoping J.K Rowling will get bored in early retirement and in a few years we will get Hogwarts Generation 2!
