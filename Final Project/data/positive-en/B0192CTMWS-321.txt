Harry's world takes an even more adult turn in the 5th installment. Gone is the naive and sweet Harry Potter, and instead we get a petulant, moody, and generally sullen teenager not terribly happy with the way things are turning out.<br />Some people may find this a turn off, I found it real and refreshing. JK Rowling also manages to shake up the formulaic narrative of the previous books, and presents a much longer opening before Harry's eventual arrival at Hogwarts. But many things familiar are not there at the outset. Hagrid for one doesn't turn up until almost halfway through the book. My only letdown, and it's minimal, is that the climax of the novel didn't live up to the pages preceding it. Overall though, once again Rowling manages to find new and creative avenues to explore, especially the detailed Ministry of Magic.
