I've waited a long time for this book and I wasn't disapponted. There are a lot of diffrent themes/subplots brought up in this book , so sometimes it feels like you're reading a bunch of short stories all at once. However the author keeps them nicely arranged (for the most part) and weaves it into one neat (and exciting) book.<br />This book is all about revalations. Revelations into some of the character's pasts and personalities, revalations about the wizarding society as a whole, as well as revalations regarding some of the secrets.  Some of these you could see coming from miles away, but I'll bet that everyone who has been following these books will come away with at least one surprise. To say more would make this a spoiler review, which I don't want to do.<br />A major theme of this book is also the elitism among the wizards and the borderline contempt/hatred they feel towards non wizards. I'm not just referring to muggles, but to ALL of the creatures encountered. Rowling goes heavily into this theme by describing some of the ill effects to the other groups that have been looked down on, especially the anger and contempt returned by those groups onto the people that mistreat them. I challenge any reader not to think about racism while they are reading those passages.<br />Also very well done is Harry's teen angst. It's been half a lifetime ago since I was that age, but Rowling really brought back memories of the confusion with the opposite sex and the annoyance/anger you get when well meaning adults keep information from you or mollycoddling you. All of the secrecy leads to a tragic conclusion that will resonate strongly with young people. There is a healthy bit of "challenge authority" here (more so than the last books) which may have some adults coughing nervously (hem, hem), but will delight many youngsters.<br />In short, its a more ambitious, more sophisticated read than the last one, but its still amazing and entertaining fun. Can't wait for book 6.
