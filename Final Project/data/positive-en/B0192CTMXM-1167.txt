The final book in this series really fills in a lot of the unkowns throughout the different books.  It has all of the action, mystery, social issues, and the eternal fight between good and evil that the other books have had, but it wraps it up in a fabulous book with a great ending.  I will miss Harry and his pals.  I hope J.K. Rowling comes up with another story line as great as the Harry Potter series has been.
