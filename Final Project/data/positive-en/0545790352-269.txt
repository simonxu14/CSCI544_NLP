Wow, talk about a visualizing stunning book! Not only is this story a classic, but this version of the book is absolutely beautiful! There are some truly amazing illustrations in this book. The book itself is much bigger than I thought the book would be, which is not a bad thing. I love that this is bigger than the average size (US) edition of the hardcovers of the HP books. It makes the book stand out even more. I love how well this book is designed. It's sturdy, and something that seems well crafted so that it can be passed down for generations. This book is definitely a timeless classic. It is a Harry Potter book fans can definitely treasure!
