I have to say that this book is very appropriate for the ending of this extraordinary tale of the Harry Potter series. The story did explained and covered the holes that appeared throughout the series. The contents of this book is so rich and thick because of the loads of events that occurs during each chapter. They are no longer at Hogwarts, as many of you know, so their adventure is just filled with adventures, not how it used to be at Hogwarts. They no longer have to use the Invisibility Cloak just to sneak off into Moaning Myrtle's bathroom to brew Polyjuice Potions. This book is just very different. It doesn't have the whole security of the Hogwarts castle to protect the characters in the story; any of them can die. I guarantee many tears while reading this book. I will spoil nothing here, seeing as I hate spoilers and I wasn't spoiled (thank goodness).<br /><br />It is just worth the read, it is truly an amazing book that readers wouldn't forget too soon.
