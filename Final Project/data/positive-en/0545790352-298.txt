GORGEOUS art on practically every page. People don't believe me when I said it's a full illustrated book and not just a picture per chapter. Bought as a gift for family that's reading the first  Harry Potter to her step daughter (6yo) and hope the illustrations will make it that much more fun. It's a big, heavy book, so not one you hold up and read, but maybe in your lap in bed to read sort of book.
