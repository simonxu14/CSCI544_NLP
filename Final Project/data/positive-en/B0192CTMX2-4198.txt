AS the others, I waited with great anticipation for this book, and was not at all disappointed.  I am eager for my friends to finish, as I want to discuss some of the nuances that I still do not totally understand, but the depth of this book, the references to Hitler-esque situations, are so relevent today. Rowling says so much more in this book than ever before, about humanity, and there is much to be learned amidst her story of magic and wizards.<br />To be honest, I do not understand how most children would understand this book at all, I would think at least 13 or 14 to grasp all that is going on, certaibnly not for 8 or 9 year olds.<br />And also, one really does have to have read the prior books, at least 5 + 6 to read this one... this cannot be the first Potter book one reads.
