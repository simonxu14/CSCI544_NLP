Got through my copy in one day.  Our darling little boy Harry is gone and in his place is moody teen Harry.  How perfectly J.K. Rowling captures those teen years!!!  Her books are such a great read even with all the slang from England.  There is no use giving away the plot since it will be practically be everywhere soon but rest assured this is not as gloomy as the last one. I was disappointed in the abundance of blood and macabre in Book 4.  We can hope Harry outgrows the angst soon.<br />Delightful twists on who is related to whom in this one.  The humor with the Weasley twins trying all sorts of questionable magic for their joke shop is a blessed relief from the bickering teens.  Still.... a wonderful world to visit.  Thanks Jo for the terrific trip.
