For those who already own the hardbacks of Harry Potter and wonder if it's worth it to spend the money on these illustrated versions, I would tell you yes.  The text of the book is still the same incredible Harry Potter story but the amazing illustrations do a lot to enhance the story.  I also love the two column layout of the text in this version.  It gives the book a different vibe.
