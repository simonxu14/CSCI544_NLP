The title says it all. I have never been at the receiving end of a fantastic delivery service until Harry Potter the 7th. All of that is thanks to my membership of the Amazon Prime. So they bumped it up to same day delivery with no cost. I'm ecstatic and eternally grateful! Nothing beats reading the last of Harry Potter series at 7 AM fresh from UPS delivery service. I wish that more product will get the same treatment. Like such is the $5 off bonus at the end of the month that you can combine with the voucher. It will hook more people up, I'm sure.
