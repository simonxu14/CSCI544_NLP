Boy was this an excellent book.  I read the entire series in the span of a month (I would have read them quicker if I hadn't had school). I am 17, but this book is as enjoyable to me as it must be to the supposed &quot;target  age group&quot; of 10 year olds.  I loved the first two novels of Harry  Potter as well, but this was the best.  In the 1st book, we are introduced  to all the characters, and in the second the characters are developed.  By  the third book, we are all used to the characters, so they're personalities  really flourish, creating a great story.  Meeting James Potter's old  friends help us learn more of his fate surrounding his death and why Sirius  Black is imprisoned, which develop the story to its fullest.  Adding  characters like Lupin and Black make for good reading.  I can't wait to  read the next one.
