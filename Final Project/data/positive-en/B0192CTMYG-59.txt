I've seen the movie at least a half dozen times, and love it. I have been reluctant to read the book simply because I thought I knew everything with the story.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />There is so much additional detail that simply cannot fit into the movie.  Fantastic read, I highly recommend. Oh, and just to shatter any stereotype that may be hanging there, I am a 43 year old guy.  This is a story that can be enjoyed by anyone who lives great story telling.
