Don't let the thickness of this book intimidate you!  You still will not want it to end.  If you have read the first three, then this one won't dissapoint you and it is arguably Rowling's best to date.  The book transports you to Harry's world and takes you right along for the ride.  It is fantastic in its imagery and action.  Enjoy!
