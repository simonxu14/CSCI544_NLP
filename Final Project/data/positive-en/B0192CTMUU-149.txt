Thinking of superlatives for J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series is becoming more and more difficult (because everything has already been said thousands of times)!  Trying to give a unique review is also becoming harder and harder.  This is another absolutely stupendous book and I really loved reading it.<br /> Harry has returned to Hogwarts for his fourth year after a fun visit with the Weasleys and a terrifying experience at the World Cup (marking the return of the death eaters).  Quidditch is not being played this year--in its place is a rigorous competition known as Tri-Wizard Tournament.  Only one contestant is selected from each of three wizarding schools with the stipulation being that the student must be seventeen.  Unsurprisingly, fourteen year-old Harry's name is also pulled out of the "Goblet of Fire."  Thus begins his solitary voyage.  With a few exceptions, Harry must make this journey alone through much of this novel.  He even becomes estranged from his best friend, Ron (Hermione does remain close to Harry).  The other students make fun of him and even ignore him. The cruelty of the Slytherins is the nastiest.  Many of the things that Harry goes through are the same as what most teens must endure as part of the growing up process.  Unfortunately, Harry does not have the benefit of loving parents to give him some must needed support so he turns to his godfather, his friends, and even a few professors.  This book is much darker and sadder than the first three books but as in the others, the writing is so beautiful that you will feel Harry's pain.  As always, Harry triumphs in the end but even this conclusion is bittersweet.
