This is my least favorite book in the series.  I think this is mostly due to Harry's attitude throughout most of the book.  He whines and complains a lot, for lack of better description.  He feels like he's been shunted away to the side and left to live with the Dursley's while everyone else is hanging out at the Order of the Pheonix and is included in everything.  Here's a quote, by Phineus Nigellus, a former Headmaster of Hogwartz (and none other than a Slytherin) that very appropriately sums up how I felt:<br /><br />&#34;You know, this is precisely why I loathed being a teacher!  Young people are so infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about everything.  Has it not occurred to you, my poor puffed up popinjay, that there might be an excellent reason why the headmaster of Hogwartz is not confiding every tiny detail of his plans to you?  Have you never paused, while feeling hard done by, to note that following Dumbledore's orders has never led you into harm?  No.  No, like all young people, you are quite sure that you alone feel and think, you alone recognize danger, you alone are the only one cleaver enough to realize what the Dark Lord may be planning.....&#34;<br /><br />Well said...to put it short and sweet.  Get over yourself!  Know that people are looking out for you and your best interests and you can't be involved in every decision.  Ok, off my podium.  *grin*  The rest of the book I really did enjoy.<br /><br />*********SPOILERS!******<br /><br />I loved the DA and seeing everyone really put forth an effort to learn, because it's right and needed, regardless of the consequences.  I abhore Deloris Umbridge and I agree with the twins that Percy is a prat!  It's interesting to see more of Neville's backstory and a foreshadowing into some of his similarities to Harry.  I wish, wish, wish...that Harry had opened Sirius' gift to him so that Harry wouldn't have gone to the Ministry of Magic and Sirius wouldn't have fallen through the gateway.  But, without this, we wouldn't know what weapon Voldemort was after.  We wouldn't fully understand Harry's importance.  Fun romp through the Department of Mysteries.  I love the brains...Ugh!  Great fight scenes.  Good set up for the final story.
