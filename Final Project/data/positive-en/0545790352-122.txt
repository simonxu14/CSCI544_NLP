Before the mid 20th century, many people kept &#34;Family Bibles,&#34; which would be larger, leather bound tomes printed on heavier paper and sometimes illustrated with engravings. They were important heirlooms, and would often have the names, birth-dates, and death-dates of ancestors and extended family in the blank pages. As a devoted Harry Potter fan, this is the definitive edition that I will keep as a sort of personal keepsake of a book that changed my life profoundly when I read it for the first time. The illustrations are simply beautiful, the paper is glossy and immaculate,  and the bindings feel quite strong. There's even a ribbon bookmark like the one in my bible!
