I absolutely love this series, it is so well written.  This is something the whole family enjoys.  I read a lot of technical/medical journals and such, so when I read for enjoyment I like to be taken out of this realm.  This series definitely does that.  I believe this will be an enduring series that our grandchildren and so on will be reading.
