JK Rowling creates an antagonist who appears to have been influenced by a certain 19th century philosopher. Perhaps he read them during Muggle Studies while a student at Hogwarts. You can catch certain pithy statements scattered throughout the seven books from Quirrell's recitation of what Voldemort taught him in Sorcerer's Stone to the Voldemort's own declamations during the climactic duel:<br />&#34;DUMBLEDORE IS DEAD!&#34;<br />[Dumbledore was] &#34;too weak to dare.&#34;<br /><br />In contrast, Rowling's protagonist and his mentor believe the most powerful thing on earth is love--self-sacrificing love. This theme starts with Lily Potter, continues through the actions of many characters, extends through Dumbledore's death and culminates in Harry's willingness to sacrifice himself.<br /><br />All over the world, Rowling offers her readers a choice between Power and Love, Horcruxes or Hallows. Yes, Rowling debunks racial prejudice and other hatreds, but she is really interested in contrasting self-seeking power and self-sacrificing love.<br /><br />This philosophical duel gets explained in a chapter entitled, &#34;King's Cross.&#34; Of all the places Rowling could have chosen to set her denouement, it just happens to be at a railway station with an evocative name.<br /><br />&#34;Of course it's happening inside your head, but why should that not be real?&#34;
