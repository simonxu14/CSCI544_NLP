I don't understand some of the negative reviews of this book.  I thought it  was a great end to a great series.  JK Rowling has a way of making you so involved in her characters that you really care about them.  Yes it is sad that some beloved characters have to perish but there is a war going on after all!  I think she does a fabulous job of telling her story!  Well done!
