It's great to have this fine quality volume in my collection.  I will buy every forthcoming "Anniversary" edition of the Potter series.  With the J.K. Rowling's own sketch of Snape included here, I wonder why she did not illustrate all of her books.  Her sketch of Snape is exactly how I imagined him and has much more gravitas and interest than the rather too whimsical drawings of her illustrator.
