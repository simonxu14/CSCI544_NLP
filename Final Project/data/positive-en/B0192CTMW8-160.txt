It seems that if Harry Potter returns to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizards that bad things will happen.  And it does.  Somebody is turning students (and others) into stone.  And it has to do with something that happened 50 YEARS AGO.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book.  Same style as the first, with a mystery, and some information about the school and history of some of the characters, like Hagrid and Tim Riddle.  Secret Chambers, snakes and spiders do make this slightly more darker than the first book, so be warned!
