High praise from all reviewers including myself so I just wanted to mention if you or anyone else noticed any other &#34;Easter Eggs&#34; in the illustrations besides the obvious differences in the Hogwarts Greenhouses on the end sheets.<br />Look closely at the bird nest at the top of the chimney on the right side of the greenhouse and you will find other differences in the greenhouse pictures as well, but I won't spoil the thrill of the hunt for you. All of the illustrations are worth a closer look.<br />I will be ordering more for gifts to my family right now!
