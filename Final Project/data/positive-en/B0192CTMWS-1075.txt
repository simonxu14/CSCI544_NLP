I do not think there is a need to rate the story itself considering the immense popularity of it.  This review is for those who produced the audio book.<br /><br />Like in the two Harry Potter stories before this one, Jim Dale and company do an excellent job of relating this tale.  Mr. Dale has an amazing range of voices and never misses a beat as he hops from one character to another.  The listener forgets Mr. Dale is the lone reader and is immediately immersed in the story.  Buy this, listen, and then watch the movie.
