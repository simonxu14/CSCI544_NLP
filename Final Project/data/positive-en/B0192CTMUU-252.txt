This time around Harry's a little older, and a lot wiser.  For the first time we see him have something of a love interest (and we become interested in something brewing between Harry's two closest friends?).  The plot is amazingly elaborate and quite unpredictable; as always, this book has been  enchanted with a bit of magic that won't let the reader put it down.  It is  funny, touching, and downright scary.  I won't divulge any secrets, but  here's a hint: more people than Harry are speaking You-Know-Who's real  name!  Altogether, a wonderful (and not-so-quick!) read - fly, don't walk,  to buy this book!
