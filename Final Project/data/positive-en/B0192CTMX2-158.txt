What a series. And to cap it off the way J.K. Rowling did - truly unbelievable.<br /><br />Harry Potter must set out on a mission with his two friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, to find and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes, the pieces of soul that are keeping Voldemort immortal. Only after the destruction of the Horcruxes can Voldemort be defeated forever. In the story, Harry faces difficult surroundings, adversity, persecution, tragedy, losses, adventure, bravery, and most importantly, love.<br /><br />J.K. Rowling has gone to new lengths with this incredible series. You can find pieces of the story littered around all seven of the books. I get excited when I find hints, clues, and pieces of foreshadowing that are later discussed and are essential pieces of the puzzle in the other books. J.K. Rowling is a master at the linking of the story, one which she began writing in 1991 on napkins in the local cafe because of her poverty, to other pieces of the story. She has truly opened up the eyes of all of the doubters and all of the people who once said that such an amazing feat was an impossible task. J.K. Rowling started off with nothing, struggling to live a normal life, sometimes having to go hungry in order to feed her baby daughter. She has become a woman who is the highest grossing author in history.<br /><br />Most importantly, the Harry Potter series has led hundreds of millions of children to start reading and also gave children, and adults as well, a friend and a comfort in the characters of Harry Potter. It is sad that the Harry Potter series cannot continue, but all good things in life must eventually come to an end. We should all praise the work ethic and efforts of J.K. Rowling, a person who has shown that anything is possible with just a little stroke of magic.
