Even though what I received was two paperback books and what I ordered was two AUDIO books, I am still giving this review 4 stars, and here is why:<br />First off, I was very excited to listen to these &#34;books on tape&#34;, as I have never done that before; I much prefer to read a book in hand.  I've heard good things, however, and will soon be traveling, so I was excited at the prospect.  I was very disappointed to open my package and find paperback books (at audio prices) and the cynic in me expected to be out of luck.<br />However, within short hours of sending my email, I got a reply from the company, expressing their apologies, explaining that they are out of stock of what I ordered, and that I am free to keep the books or donate them as I see fit.  My account was credited the money spent IMMEDIATELY and no further problems arose.<br />If you ask me, in an age when we can do everything online, we get snotty and expect more than we should.  Mistakes happen, I am okay with that, just fix it - and this company did, right away.  Much more than I expected and shame on me for that.  Good for them, would order from them again.
