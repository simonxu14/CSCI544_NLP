J.K. Rowling is a genius!  First of all let me say thank you to this very talented and creative lady.  I have enjoyed all the Harry Potter books from  the beginning and am pleased to see the integrity and quality of the series  maintained so well.<br />One always hopes that a sequel will bear out the  reputation that the original book has carved for itself.  Harry Potter and  the Goblet of Fire doesn't just maintain the standard, it raises the bar.  One of the things about this series that I enjoy so much is that the aging  of the characters is handled realistically and in good literary style.  Harry's fourteen now and the social/life problems he's encountering are  pretty much the norm for any adolescent. Well, an adolescent wizard anyway.  I urge all fans of the series to read Goblet of Fire.  As for myself, all I  want to be is the next Professor of Muggle Studies at Hogwart's!  Kudos Ms.  Rowling, keep up the great work!
