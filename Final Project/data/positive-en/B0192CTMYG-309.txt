I had already read all four of the available Harry Potter books before I listened to the audio versions of the same books.  (I borrowed the tapes from a friend).  The books impressed me as some of the best writing and storytelling I have ever read, and the audio versions do justice to the writing.  The reader, Jim Dale, is an award-winning actor who makes the writing come alive.  (Although he does pronounce Hagrid differently from the way I do.  Is it "Hay-grid" or "Hag-rid"?)  The CD's and tapes are unabridged, so the listener doesn't miss a word of Rowling's great writing.<br />I often drive solo, and really enjoy listening to talk rather than music.  The Harry Potter audio series is perfect for an interesting diversion from miles of straight freeway.  If you are traveling by car with children, these audio versions of the books could make your trip much more enjoyable.<br />These CD's are expensive, which is why I bought only one at first.  I intend to get a new one with each Amazon order until I own the entire set.
