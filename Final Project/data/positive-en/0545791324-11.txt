After purchasing the last Illustrated Edition, I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of the next book. The last edition was a wonderful interpretation of the scenes and characters, and this one is even better. This may be in part of Jim Kay gaining more confidence in his interpretations as he had previously been nervous about releasing his illustrations to a rather popular series.<br /><br />There seems to be a higher concentration on the creatures in this edition rather then the characters. While I would have liked to have seen his interpretation of some of the characters (Tom Riddle included), the designs of the beasts are gorgeous and look like they have come out of a textbook from the Hogwarts curriculum in some cases.<br /><br />If there is one legitimate complaint that I have it is that, as like with the last edition, the binding seems to be ill-suited to constant use. Merely a few days after moderate use, I started to notice the pages becoming much more loose with heavy crackling sounds just from opening it up a third of the way. I worry that in the future I may not be able to open it for fear of the pages tumbling out.<br /><br />Regardless, this edition is beautiful and I highly recommend any Harry Potter fan, or those with children, to purchase this volume.
