This was her best book yet!  I was really glad to see the story unfold - and with more detail and excitement than I anticipated too!  I'm sad to see the story end but she did a marvelous job at wrapping it up and having all of her books tie together in this final story.  I would definitely recommend this book and this series to anyone!
