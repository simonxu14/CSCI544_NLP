Reading with my great grandson over the phone every night is a wonderful shared experience as we go to Hogwarts with Harry and his friends, his enemies and his mentors. The values of friendship, integrity and loyalty are taught by Rowling as we follow with fascination the challenges Harry Potter faces and how he finds solutions with the help of others.
