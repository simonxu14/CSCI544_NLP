While I thoroughly enjoyed this literary work, I must point out that the characters involved bear a ~very~ close resemblance to the principle characters in the 1986 Made for TV movie entitled, "The Worst Witch."  The similarities are startling.  However...<br /><br />I must say that I was hooked on the first few paragraphs.  This work, while not necessarily well-written, is quite well conceived, with enough of an expanded vocabulary usage to warrant reading with a dictionary at your side.  This is great for children who are learning, and adults who wish to increase their reading skills.<br /><br />The characters are developed well enough to keep us interested, but not so well as to delineate their full potential; a culpable ploy which leaves the reader wanting more.<br /><br />I love the magical world created by Ms. Rowling, I find the plot to be treacherously sinister, and the twists and clues are darkly intriguing.  I highly recommend this entire series to anyone with an imagination.  Regardless of your age, there is something here for you.
