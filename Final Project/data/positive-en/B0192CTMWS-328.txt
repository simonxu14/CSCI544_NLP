There could have been no other way to end the saga of Harry Potter more beautifully than what JK Rowling had done in Deathly Hallows.<br />Without, of course, giving anything away, the book deals with every loose story from the books previous, and as she usually does, she takes her readers beyond their own imagination and expectation, and totally leaves us breathless to the very end.<br />Definitely darker than the other books previous, we read as Harry must make his final choices in the attempt to destroy Voldemort once and for all, and all the while Voldemort's reign turns the world darker than readers had previously experienced.<br />It has been a thrill and an eye-watering experience to travel the tales of Harry Potter, and I am for certain that his saga will be read for centuries to come.
