Technology has created somewhat of a void with regard to a child holding a book and reading it. In order to accomplish this I decided that rather than giving a gift card to a toy store a well known book such as Harry Potter and particularly the Sorcerer's Stone would be the best present. This particular book, hard cover, filled with great pictures and an exciting story proved to be the right choice for my grandson. From the moment he received this Rowling book he was attached to it all the time. Signing in the inside cover also personalized this special gift and I would hope it remains with him forever until he passes it on to his children. its an outstanding book and represents Rowling at her best in addition to the publishers presentation for retail book selling. its packaged beautifully in a quality and vibrant picture sleeve that carries the quality from cover to cover. Definitely would make a memorable gift for any occasion and sign the inside cover to personalize.
