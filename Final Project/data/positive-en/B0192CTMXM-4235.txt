Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Book 5) is quite possibly the best installment in this series yet. Rowling had more time to write this one, and it certainly shows. That's saying something, given how excellent the previous book was. What I really liked best about the 5th book is its dealings with the Magic World's government and how the government is not always as reliable as it may seem. Lots of characters and things from previous books that seemed so reliable are suddenly unreliable in this book. Plus, Harry, Ron, Hermione and their friends are all finally looking forward to their futures--a true sign of their growing up.<br />Filled with surprises (some good, some painful), Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a wonderful read. I'm already waiting for the next installment!
