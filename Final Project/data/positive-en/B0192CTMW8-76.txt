I picked up the first in Rowling's series in an airport, and at 22, was a little embarassed buying it. However, I am hooked! These books are interesting, fun and full of adventure. The Harry Potter books are a great series that I think would get any child hooked on reading. They also provide nice light reading for adults every once in a while or as a book that parents and children can read together.
