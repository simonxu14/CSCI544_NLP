I have read all 7 of the Harry Potter books three times and Book 5 (HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX) is my favorite.  It is unfortunate that the movie was so poor.  It did not do justice to this book which gives many more of the characters a life.  It is filled with, of course the three main characters, Harry, Hermione, and Ron, but they are getting older and I believe Rowling handles this extremely well.  Although the book is a little on the dark side, she infuses enough humor that you can't help but laugh at the escapades.  This book grabs you immediately and you do not want to put it down.
