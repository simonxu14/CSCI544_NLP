Jim Dale reading the final installment of Harry Potter. It doesn't get any better than this.<br /><br />Jim Dale is such a great reader that I listen to his audios, even if I'm not so sure about the book he's reading.<br /><br />Harry Potter is the best fantasy series writting in the last decade or so. The richness of the stories and characters and their ties into folklore and mythology are wonderful. That this standard could be maintained across several novels is fantastic.
