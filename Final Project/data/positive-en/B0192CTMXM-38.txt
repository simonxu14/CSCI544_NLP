My son started reading Harry Potter books in 4th grade and he's now finished all of them up! It's the start of 5th grade and he LOVES these books!<br /><br />The order of the Phoenix is outstanding and he was REALLY happy to get it!<br /><br />He told me that I absolutely MUST read them in order. (I've started on the first book and love it so far).  We all watched the movies together as a family and I highly recommend this to children of all ages, including 46 years old like me.<br />:)<br />Well done J.K. Rowling!
