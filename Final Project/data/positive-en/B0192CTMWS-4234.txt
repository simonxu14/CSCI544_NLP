So the 7th and final instalment of Harry Potter has come and another fantastic saga has come to an end. I was very eager to see how the ending of the story was going to come out after I put down book 6 2 years ago. As a fan of the books as well as the films (the books are better of course) I have to say that I was left, satisfied. There are so much hype over this last installment too much for my taste. I think that the whole ending was not intendted to be some incredible ending, I mean let's face neither was Lord Of The Rings. Rowlings objective here was simpley to end the story by closing up the gaps and putting the big Harry Voldemort story to rest. I have to admit there were times I was extremly bored because the book was moving so slow but I kept on reading to see what would happen next. Rowling did a great job picking up the pace as the book was coming to a close. The final battle between the two sides of the wizarding world was awesome and with all the deaths that occured some actually made me shead a few tears inside. Rowlings final showdown was surley a compiling of all the sci-fi/fantasy/disneyesque good vs evil battles and she pulled it off the way it was meant to be. It didn't have to be a flashy battle but mearley a true test of stregnth as to why the loser had to be defeated. The epologue, I liked as most people say it reads like fan fiction, thats why she wrote it that way. Because there were so many screaming fans wondering what would happen after this whole story and what made me so happy about it was she gave the fans exactly what they wanted to read. All and all reading book 7 just makes me want to pick up book one and finally read all 7 books and see this story that will live in our hearts forever whole in all it's magical glory.
