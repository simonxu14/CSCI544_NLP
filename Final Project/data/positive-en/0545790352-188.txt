I just received my book!  This book is exquisitely beautiful!  The pictures that I have seen posted from some of the posts in these reviews really do not give it justice.  I am at work right now (had it shipped to my office), and had to open it immediately and thumb through every page.  I saw that one reviewer was upset because the book was not protected by bubble wrap when they received it.  Amazon I believe has now corrected this problem.  It was packed with air bubble wrap and did not move at all until I opened it.  J.K. Rowling turned our children back to reading and I can personally attest to this!  My son, back when he was 9 years old HATED to read.  I had to force him to do it as it was required for school.  My mom actually found the first two Harry Potter books at a discount store and bought them for him.  He started reading the first one and now, 8 years later, I can easily say that he has read well over 300 books and buys new ones all as soon as he finishes the last.<br /><br />Please if you have a young child that doesn't like to read or is just getting into it (3rd-4th the requirements for reading pick up significantly for school), buy THIS book.  The beautiful illustrations and the wonderful story telling that J.K. Rowling tells will introduce your child into a whole new world of beautiful imagination.
