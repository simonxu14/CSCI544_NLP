Like all the other books in the series, this is a very quick and<br />enjoyable read.  As the series progressed the themes became<br />more complex, and the writing increased in quality. Overall,<br />I think the sixth book was better.  However,  J.K. Rowling<br />really managed to keep it all together here and deliver a dramatic<br />build-up and satisfying conclusion to the series.  I enjoyed the<br />move to high fantasy in the end - it was entirely appropriate<br />to cap the series.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see how this series holds up over time.<br />Will it take a place next to Narnia, or will it be forgotten<br />like so many others?  I would give a better chance to either<br />His Dark Materials, or the Abarat series, but who knows...
