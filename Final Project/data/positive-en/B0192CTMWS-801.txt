Order of the Phoenix is by far Ms. Rowling's longest, darkest, and best addition to the Harry Potter series.  The familiar cast of characters returns (with some memorable additions!) and Rowling fleshes out these characters and their personalities even further than she has done in her past books.  The same goes for the plot: it is more intricate and layered than any of her books to date.  Harry and company are faced with difficult decisions in a world that is increasingly grey, as distinctions between good and bad, right and wrong become as unclear as ever.<br />Best of all, this book maintains the magical quality, impressive depth, and mystical attraction that has become the standard for the Harry Potter series.  The book is almost 1000 pages, but I will imagine most readers, if they are like me, will not be able to put it down until they are finished.  Please, Ms. Rowling: don't make us wait another three years for the continuation of this saga!<br />Another excellent book!
