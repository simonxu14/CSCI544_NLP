This is one of my all-time favorite books.  It wraps up every question any reader could possibly have in a nice little bow, and it makes sure that the answers are satisfying and sometimes even unexpected.  The way that Rowling wrapped up her series with this most stupendous of novels is incredible.  The world she has created and populated with characters of all different shapes, sizes, and magical orientations is one that every child - young and old alike - should take the time to read.  The magical aspects alone are intoxicating (especially since I wanted to be Samantha from &#34;Bewitched&#34; or Sabrina from &#34;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&#34; when I was little), but the relationships among characters and the way she finds to describe the past and how it imposes on the future is ridiculously well-crafted and realistic.  Anyone can identify with at least one of the emotions that Harry or his friends feel within this novel, as well as any of the others that Rowling has written.  She appeals to the masses, and this is not an easy task.<br /><br />Beth Rodgers, Author of YA Novel 'Freshman Fourteen'
