This is a great book! I had read the first two books in the series, but this was the one that really hooked me on Harry Potter! Since I was a preteen when this book came out, I only got the paperback. Since then I had acquired all of the other books in the series in hardback, except for this one, so I was very excited to get it for such a great price! If you haven't read this book or the HP series, you definitely should!
