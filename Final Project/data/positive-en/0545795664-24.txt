I bought this for my 5 year old's birthday, and it was her favorite out of all the presents!  It shows all the Pokemon to X & Y in the National Pokedex order.  She can leaf through it and identify so many of them.  What is REALLY good for her, since she's working on letter identification and sounding out words, is seeing her favorite Pokemon's names in print.  It's taking one of her favorite things in the world, and making it a learning experience.  For example, I'll ask her to find &#34;Bulbasaur&#34; for me, she knows she has to look in the &#34;Bs&#34; for it, and then have her spell it for me!  These exercises will eventually help her with sounding out &#34;real&#34; words and learning how to read.  (she just started kindergarten).<br /><br />I recommend this for young and old Pokemon fans, but the idea I expressed above is certainly a winner in my house!  So parents, give this a thought for education!
