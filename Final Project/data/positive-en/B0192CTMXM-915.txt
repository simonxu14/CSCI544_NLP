I have read every single harry potter book and I absolutely love all the books. This book has a lot more action in it which is a plus, I was at the edge of my seat because some much is happening inside the book the way j.k. Rowling tells the story is unbelievable. I like how in this book we get to see more of dumbledore's past because he has always been some kind of mystery to us readers. Also we get to learn more about snape's past also because he was also a mystery. With all the rumors going on you'll be surprised how the book ended. my only problem is that the book can lose its affect by being too serious sometimes. it make me wonder what ever happened tot he harry potter that used to be happy and have fun with his friends.5 stars..2 thumbs up and all of everything.
