I picked up this book as a whim 3 years ago when I was 22 because i wanted to see what the hype was all about. I was hooked after chapter 2.  This book starts the whole Harry Potter trend. If you like fantasy, Sci-fi, and great characters, please pick up this book.  You will not regret it, and will be running out to pick up the rest.
