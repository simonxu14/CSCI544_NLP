This book had such an epic ending to such an epic book series that stimulated my reading and imagination like it hadn't been stimulated since CS Lewis wrote the Chronicles of Narnia I had read when I was of elementary school age. The book is way better than the movie. I highly advise that you read it before you see the movie if you haven't already.
