Bought my first copy of this when my 14 year old was only an infant, and as I have no idea where it is now, bought this one for my 9 year old who devoured it in days.  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first book in the amazing series by JK Rowling chronicling the adventures and story of young Harry, a wizard brought up in the non-wizarding Muggle world.  He is learning of his past and being warned about enemies that he didn't even know existed in this book, also making friends that will stay with him and help him through the years to come.<br /><br />PS - still waiting on my letter to Hogwarts
