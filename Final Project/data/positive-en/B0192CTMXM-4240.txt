Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a rousing epic end to one of the most celebrated series of books in history. Without revealing any spoilers, the book finishes up the great war for the wizarding world and the final confrontation between Harry Potter, the boy wizard who has grown near to manhood, and the Dark Lord Voldemort. It is a dark, sometimes scary, occassionally sad tale that is filled with loss and sacrifice, but also redemption and the grandeur which is the eternal battle between good and evil. Long time fans of Harry Potter, whether they have grown up with him as children, or discovered him as an adult, will be well satisified. Whatever the writing plans of J.K. Rowling are in teh future, it is greatly hoped that she will one day return to the wizarding world that she has made as famous as Middle Earth and Narnia in the annals of fantastic literature
