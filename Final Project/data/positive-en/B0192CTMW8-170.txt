I'm 19. A love reading but I wasn't quite interest about Harry Potter's series. Nevertheless some of my friends told me they were great, so I have to give them a chance. And I just have to say the books are really amazing. This one has an extraordinary rhythm and has ethical messages without a moralist tone. And the best of all it isn't a childlike book, is very nice to read because age doesn't matter.
