I loved this book.....it was a very fast read and kept you on your toes.  I love how it tied all 6 previous books together and showed you exactly why the characters had the roles they did.  I loved the Epilogue.....(...)  GREAT book!!!!!!  JKR is one of the best writers I have ever read...Thank you!!
