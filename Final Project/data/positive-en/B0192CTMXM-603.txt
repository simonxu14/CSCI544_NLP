As you move through the Harry Potter series the reading level gets progressively more difficult - so does the intensity and darkness of the books. The relative innocence of the first book may fool parents into thinking the whole series is appropriate for young readers. A word of caution - in my opinion it isn't.<br />I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the books in the series but I have to say I came away from this latest book with mixed emotions. The innocence is definitely gone! This book is full of anger. Harry Potter's anger and frustration made him seem almost like a stranger at times. I really got caught up in his anger at the injustice, both real and perceived, that he and others suffer in the book. I'm concerned how it may affect younger readers.<br />Plus, at 15, Harry is growing up and facing adult situations and emotions. As a mother I found myself wanting to sit down with him to counsel and comfort him as a parent would. The kid in me wished I could be his friend and fly off on a thestral - to fight at his side!<br />So - do I recommend this book? Yes, I liked the book and didn't want to put it down as is evidenced by me reading all 870 pages in 3 days! But I urge some caution - I think this book is more suited to mature audiences. I won't be reading this one to my 7 year old granddaughter for a few years. Can't wait to see this one in the theatre though! Should have some spectacular scenes!<br />Am I eager for the next installment? You bet! I am after all a big Harry Potter fan!
