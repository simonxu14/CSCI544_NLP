Harry's adventures (and J.K. Rowling's ingenius writing) continues with this second installment. No disappointments here. Although the story sagged a bit in the middle (just a bit!), this one was just as good as the first.<br />Terrific plot twists and vivid imagery. It was wonderful to get re-acquainted with some old friends and meet new ones...and as always, I love how Rowling depicts the Dursleys. She has a great sense of humor.<br />The first chapter will have you in stitches.<br />Get this one!<br />Cris
