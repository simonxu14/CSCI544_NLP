My big cousin just started reading the books after loving the movies. I told her she would love the books better. Its a switching game we play. She got me into Stephen King Books. I got her into Harry Potter. It arrived in Pristine condition. Spines weren't cracked. Fresh, like off the presses. It arrived in about the time expected.
