The Harry Potter Series, in my opinion, is comparable to the Lord of the Rings trilogy with it's in-depth descriptions of characters, scenes, plots and of course the universal theme of good vs. evil. She ended it beautifully and without giving too much away I will say that I hope someday she continues to give us more stories of the remaining characters, perhaps a new generation of Potter adventures. I was pleased to see how she developed the Snape and Malfoy characters in this final book. What a wonderful read, I can't wait to pass it on to future generations and enjoy it all over again with them.
