I was very nervous about reading the final book.  I wanted (still do) Harry Potter books to continue forever.  J.K.Rowling writes his life and world so well that I wanted to live (all be it briefly) in all aspects of his life for years to come.  I was sure I was going to hate the book and never want to read it again.  But J.K.Rowling pulled it off.  Another Excellent book.  She pulled all the pieces together nicely.  I treasure the entire series and I will read and reread all 7 again and again and again.
