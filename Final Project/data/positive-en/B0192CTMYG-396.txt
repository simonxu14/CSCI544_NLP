Being a huge fan of the books, I was a little sceptical about getting the audio version. I love hearing and visualizing in my own mind as I read. I have to say that Jim Dale is wonderful on this and the other recordings. He really brings the characters to life, and his flexible voice changes for each character. Highly recommended for traveling or those who have a hard time reading printed books.
