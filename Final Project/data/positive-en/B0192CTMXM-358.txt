I wasn't sure if I should enter my opinion into this very popular book's review section.Tossing the idea around I decided I would.<br /><br />I did enjoy this book very much. The story line was compelling and kept me riveted until the end. Maybe I was rushing to reach the end so I could see how the story concluded. Maybe it was because so many had already read the book and knew whether or not Harry dies in the end.<br /><br />I wont tell you how it ends, I will tell you that the conclusion leaves you feeling complete and happy. Some are angry with the ending but I think that most people find that it was the right thing to do. All in all a great story and fitting conclusion to the saga that has held me for the past 7 years.
