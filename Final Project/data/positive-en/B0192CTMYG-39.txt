Our first copy of the book got damaged, so this is a replacement. Love the Harry Potter series, like so many other fans. These are well written stories that can entertain all ages. We got this to begin our grandson on the books. He is loving it now, too. This is a paperback version, which is not quite as nice as the hard cover editions that we have of many of the later ones from the series, but it is good quality all the same.
