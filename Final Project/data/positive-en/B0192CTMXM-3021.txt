I was worried that with all the hype about the book that it would be a disappointment, but it definately was worth waiting for!!  I finished the book last night & couldn't hardly put it down (Read it in 2 days).  It is much darker than the previous books and Harry is becoming a very, very angry boy.  He has had so much happen to him & has seen so much.<br />The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is an utter nightmare.  I have to say that I could pit her against Snape and I'm not sure who would win.  You learn a few interesting facts about Snape in this book also.<br />I don't want to give too much away but I will say that knowing that someone was going to die made the whole book more suspenseful.  Too many people end up in perilous situations and you wonder, will it be this person?  I was on pins and needles through the whole second half of the book.  I was upset with who died, but I guess I can't have my way or none of the main characters would ever die.<br />The book does end with a bang.  The whole end "fight" scene was amazing!!  We finally do learn a lot about the mysterious things in Harry's past.  Things make a lot more sense now about why things are happening to him.<br />I have to encourage any Harry Potter fan to READ THIS BOOK!!!  If you haven't ever read Harry Potter I would suggest reading the first 4 books before this one.  It would help keep your facts straight.  It is a darker and sometimes more depressing book but I absolutely Loved It!!!
