Rowling's Prisoner of Azbakan is a wonderfully written book.  With the recent troubled world seeming to fall<br />apart around me, I took the opportunity of reading it as &quot;light&quot; fiction, and found myself engrossed in the<br />characters, the carefully woven plot and the imaginative setting.  I had already read the first two Harry Potter<br />books and had found them charming enough, but this episode seems to be somewhat more developed than<br />the previous two.  The various elements of the plot were almost as skillfully interwoven as those of a well<br />written murder mystery (the only other type of narrative prose I indulge in with regularity).<br />Although a little predictable in some respects, this did not detract from the story.  Here as in the earlier books,<br />the author has taken up some very grown up motives.  Among these are: the death of parents, the loss and/or<br />death of pets, the occasional falling out of friends, the unexpected goodness of individuals thought to be &quot;evil,&quot;<br />the fact that what &quot;everyone&quot; believes about an individual may not be true, that it's important to give the other<br />guy a chance to fully explain his point of view, the fact that fairness and justice are not always in the cards<br />even for the &quot;good guys,&quot; the fact that some individuals can influence events according to their own agenda<br />because they have power and wealth, etc.<br />For children learning to live in a grown up world, the book certainly gives small doses of reality orientation<br />along with its fantasy.  The hero, as usual, comes out on top of the central action, but he does not always<br />prove to be totally correct about his understanding of events, and everything doesn't work out entirely his way.<br />Above all the book underscores the notion that it is best to make value judgments with caution, and when<br />contrary data come ones way to be willing to change opinions accordingly--something even adults aren't<br />always good at doing.<br />Although many of the &quot;lessons&quot; in living could become platitudinous, in fact to a degree are so, on the whole<br />the parable is delivered without being saccharine enough to put off an adult reader or so condescending as to<br />put off a younger reader.  Here as in the earlier books, Rowling has managed to capture a very broad audience<br />successfully because she has many things to say to each reader.  I enjoyed it immensely and have<br />recommended it to a number of people, none of them children.  I also plan on giving the book to a friend with<br />several children--but only after my husband reads it!
