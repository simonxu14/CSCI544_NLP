Finished this in about 6 days, and for me that was very fast.  Almost every chapter makes you want to keep reading.  This took about the same amount of time to read as the Goblet of Fire (Harry potter 4'th book).<br />Being from "Across the POND", J.K. Rowling used a few expressions that people in the America's might not understand, especially younger kids.  This did not take away from the book though.<br />The Vocabulary was advanced at times, with words I would never expect a 15 year old to know.<br />To sum up the book, Almost everything Harry looks forward to at hogwarts gets taken away form him by the ministry of magic(who made harry out to be a Crazy Kid telling lies about the Dark Lord's return), he is now "mentally" connected with the Dark Lord(voldermort), and after facing Voldermort's followers(Death Eaters), he winds up with Dumbludor revealing the secret to Harry's Life and why he is so "special", something he never mentioned in the previous 4 books.<br />As all this has been happening, harry has become Much More Short Tempered, and really gets temperamental at times.<br />I myself thought the ending of the 4'th book was WAY DARKER then this book &lt;I actually cried at the ending of the 4'th book>, but this book had more "semi-dark" aspects, still suitable for young kids though.<br />Also, this book did not have that "twist ending", that the other 4 books had, this did not affect the book though In My Honest Opinion(IMHO).<br />This is a must-read for anyone who likes things to do with magic or people who liked the previous 4 harry potter books.<br />~Hope this helps
