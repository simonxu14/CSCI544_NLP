Roller coaster is not a word that explains the plot twists and the path changes that the story takes.  You have to have read all the previous books in order to complete the story, the movies cut out so much that is relevent to the last book.  The final chapter is almost a let down, as while it is nice to see the future lives and how the circle continues, it leaves the reader who has invested so much in reading and retaining all the information from the previous books, looking for more.  It is akin to the yearly Christmas letter that we get from relatives each year; a condensed, Cliff-notes version of what has happened, without getting any real information.  After reading the book and completing the series, it seems rather unnecessary to see any of the remaining movies, they cut so much out of them.  The only remedeming thing that Hollywood could do is learn to put more in the last two movies.
