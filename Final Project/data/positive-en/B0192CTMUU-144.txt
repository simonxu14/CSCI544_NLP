This is the fourth novel in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series but the first that I've read.  My daughter urged me to read it and since she's a teenager I'm happy for any opportunity to make a connection with her.<br /><br />Readers familiar with this series or the Harry Potter movies will know that this book focuses on Harry Potter, a young wizard, and his two best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.  Harry plays a leading role in a pitched struggle between good and evil wizards, and it is this struggle that provides the necessary suspense in the novel.  Harry is not particularly smart, but he is brave.  Hermione is the smart one.  Ron is a goofy sidekick to Harry and he "likes" Hermione although he doesn't always know it.  Behind this trio is a legion of well-developed major and minor characters, from the evil Lord Valdemort to the wise Professor Dumbledore, from bureaucrats to bullies, from giants to elves and goblins.<br /><br />These characters interact in a believable magical world, complete with poverty (the Weasleys are good and hard working but poor), prejudice (against muggles* and wizards with muggle parents), and injustice (wizards enjoy privilege; elves form a servant class). The furniture of this magical world is appealing: a giant bathtub with a diving board, portraits that talk, a purple carpeted stadium for the Quidditch world cup, fires that send purple sparks into the air, and so on.  Hogwarts castle is the site of most of the action, and here there are many cozy interior scenes in front of the fire at Hagrid's cabin or in the Gryffindor common room.<br /><br />Beyond the major theme of good versus evil, this book has many themes that will appeal to the young audience that Rowling is aiming at.  There is much attention paid to the price of fame: while Harry's fame makes him the center of attention, it also makes people envious and ready to believe the worst about him.  Harry often suffers in silence rather than trying to correct those misimpressions.  In fact, for a powerful wizard, Harry has remarkably little control over the events that affect him.  He pretty much has to do what the adults around him tell him to do, a plight that Rowling's intended readers are familiar with.<br /><br />* Muggles are ordinary humans with no magical powers.  They aren't very important.
