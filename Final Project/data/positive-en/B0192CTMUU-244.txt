As a 3rd grade teacher, I have to say that this one is a little more sophisticated than my students could handle, but in a couple of years they'll be ready!  Iti is wonderful how Ms Rowling has improved the story  with a new storyline that varies from the first three. Harry seems much  more trusting of adults (or dogs!) and he makes choices that are not  self-destructive. He is a magical boy--but he is a boy any kid can look to  as a role model, for his bravery and kindness.  I have watched my  students get excited over this series like I've never seen before. It is so  rewarding to see this from a book and not a video game! Way to go J.K. and  way to go Harry!
