this is my favorite book because harry stole my heart...for a child that was mistreated most of his life he was a great kid who almost always made good choices ...my daughter bought a very special one for me...a collector's edition...i read it asap...the illustrations were beautiful...but i bought this one from amazon to fill in the one i lost...
