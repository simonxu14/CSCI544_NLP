I bought this in Spanish when I took Spanish in high school that way I could explore the different tenses that shift. Even with a Spanish dictionary and my Spanish notes it does take me quite a bit of time to read just a few pages but it did help increase my Spanish! Also it was fun to follow along with the English version in this popular tale of Harry Potter.
