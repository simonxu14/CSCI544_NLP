Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a remarkable story for kids to teens and a majority of adults. I chose a rating of five stars. Why? Because in this book you really seem to be with and growing up with the character. I enjoyed the curiosity of what  the next chapter would be like. For example every time I was done with a chapter I would think what is going to happen to  ? Or was that a dream or not  ? I wonder how they are going to escape from  ? I highly recommend reading this book.
