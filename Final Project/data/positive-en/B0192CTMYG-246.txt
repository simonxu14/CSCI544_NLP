If you love the films, you will adore the books.Films are great, but books are for handing down to your children. As a parent, I have been fabulously fortunate to have my babies (now in their 30's) have the same reading and viewing (up to a point, after all they're girls) tastes. We buy each other books and videos, video games and systems as well. I am a lucky Dad.
