It did not have a jacket, but I didn't ask if it did so maybe that is my fault. And it had a cigarette smoke smell--i don't smoke so that bothered me a little. It did arrive very quickly, though, so I was pleased with that. Also the price was worth a chance--overall I probably should give it a 5 star because it was in pretty good shape, but with no jacket and the smoke smell I had to take one star off.
