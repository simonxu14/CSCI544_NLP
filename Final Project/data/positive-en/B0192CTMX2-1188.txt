This is an excellent read!  The longest of Rowling's books so far, it is also darker, but very satisfying.  Plot elements that have been working for the last four books are brought together.  Not all questions are answered, and there is more mystery generated that will need to be cleared up in the next two books, but Book Five is very satisfying to read.  I highly recommend it!  Enjoy reading!
