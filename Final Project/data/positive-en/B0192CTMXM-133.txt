Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts is one of more adventures and unexpected twists. There's a reason these books are so popular. The characters keep you entertained and the plot doesn't move too fast or too slow. Don't think the movie has the same content as the book because they are different. These are such a nostalgic books I find myself reading them just to remember what it was like to get lost in literature and feel like a kid again.
