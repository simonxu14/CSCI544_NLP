If you do not know Harry Potter, you should! This series is amazing and life changing! Great quotes, great characters, great fun! The books grow as Harry grows, and my seem childish at first, but will leave you bawling like a baby by the end of the series. This is one of my favorites in the series, it really starts to take the darker turn. Be sure and start with Sorcerer'sâ€‹ Stone though!
