A wonderful series of stories about a young wizard, his education, friends and adventures.  There must be very few people who have not heard of Harry, Ron and Hermione, Lord Voldemorte, or the amazing Albus Dumbledor.  This series is a classic example of a coming-of-age story about a young person who must learn how to deal with life and difficulties from an early age.<br /><br />The stories are written to capture the interest of the younger reader, with stories that recount classrooms, meals, and the disregard of rules.  It's also a series that the reading adult can find much interest in as well.  Be warned, these stories start out with adventures, but because of the nature of the theme, get darker and more involved as time passes and Harry gains in age, education and ability.  But the stories reflect what is best in all of us and should be read with that expectation.<br /><br />In this outing Harry and his friends must deal with an escaped convict, an endangered hippogriff and dementors.  Of course the Dursleys start things out and Draco Malfoy has a hand in the goings-on as well. How will Harry, Ron and Hermione finally save the day?
