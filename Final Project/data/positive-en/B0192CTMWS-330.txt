Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix is the longest and my favorite of the series. I was not interested in this francise until part 1 of Deathly Hallows released and I thought it an obligation to see the previous entries before watching the movie. I still don't like the sorcerers stone but the prisoner of azakaban peeked my interest enough to see how much better the novels were and I am so glad I did. Order of the Phoenix is a stellar achievement in any genre and this is coming from a man who avoids fantasy titles most always because I feel it would be betraying my science fiction fandom. Crazy I know but just goes to show how good this book is. No spoilers but High inquisitor Delorous Umbrige is a villain you cannot help but hate and Luna Lovegood is a personal favorite because she is so weird and Jim Dale's choice of voice for her is strange but oddly adds to her mystique. In short while not wanting to ramble too long I'll simply say for those who love Fantasy and others who do not this is a work for all who want to enjoy the majesty of the fantasy genre.
