It's so beautiful! I love the illustrations - even the pages without actual pictures have a &#34;texture&#34; behind the print. The wording is a bit different than the original American print. Some words are changed back to the original British English terms (ie, Philosopher's Stone instead of Sorcerer's Stone).
