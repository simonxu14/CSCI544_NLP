While controversy may still surround the subject matter of Rowling's books, she nevertheless delivers a literary masterpiece in the latest, greatest edition to her ever-popular series. This book is the biggest, and darkest, of them all, bringing our hero Harry closer to his ultimate encounter with the dark lord "he-who-shall-not-be-named". He must also face a wretched school administrator, an antagonistic house elf, and impotent magical government authorities. Luckily for Harry he has a host of loyal friends to help him through this maze of uncertainty.<br />I have read the book, and have listened to the sound recording featuring Jim Dale and if I had a choice, I would highly recommend that you purchase the CD or audio version. Dale is an extraordinarily talented voice actor. He brings each character to life in a humorous, energetic matter. Absolutely fabulous.<br />Cris Cunningham
