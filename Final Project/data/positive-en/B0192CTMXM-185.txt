Yes, I bought the Deluxe Edition which had a cardboard box cover signed by JKR.  I purchased it from Amazon via the advanced-order service and had forgotten I had ordered the Deluxe version by the time it arrived.  Initially, I wasn't really impressed but now that I've finished the book, I'm really glad I spent the few extra dollars.<br /><br />Like many people, I loved the whole series.  I re-read 5 and 6 before beginning 7 simply because I'd read #4 (which used to me my favorite) so many times that I'd forgotten what happened in the next 2 books.  I read the last 3 books in one week which probably influenced my overall opinion of #7 which is that I found it to be simply amazing.  I just finished today and am now suffering from withdrawl.  I agree with the critism that the Prologue should have been longer with more detail but that is simply because I didn't want the story to end.  All I can do now is send out a word of thanks to JKR for such a wonderful and uplifting tale.
