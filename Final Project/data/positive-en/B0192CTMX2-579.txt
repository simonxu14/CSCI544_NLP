Just as the rest of the world did, I waited with anticipation for the fifth book to arrive.  I was estatic when my copy arrive from Amazon.  I dived right in and was not disappointed.  I admit that the number of pages was intimidating, however, like all the other Potter books, it just flowed.<br />The story is definitely darker and more intimate than the previous novels.  Rowling lets us see very deeply into mind of Harry and how frustrating it can be as a famous wizard and a growing adolescent.  From Harry's extreme moods swings to his rambling rages that upset everyone around him, you can see how much Harry is growing up and the extreme pressure that is forming around him.<br />The introduction of the New Dark Arts instructor definitely presents new problems and struggles for Harry as well as for the rest of the entire school.  I love the fact that Snape was placed in a different light and given the opportunity to show the rest of the world why he is how he is.  Rowling showed many levels of Snape and the rest of the adults in the story and made me want to get to know them better.<br />I was disappointed in the ways that the anticipated death of a 'main character' was played out.  Rowling had many storylines that led up to a wide variety of possible deaths and then, at the end, she leaves "the character" with a death that does not seem plausible and is ambiguous.<br />I would definitely recommend this novel to the avid Harry Potter fan.  I could not put it down (done in a day and a half) and am going to re-read it for a more detailed understanding of all of the new characters that have been introduced.
