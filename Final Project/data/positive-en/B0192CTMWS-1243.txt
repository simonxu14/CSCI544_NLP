I was pleased about the length of the book.  Rowlings went into quite a bit of detail.  It was great reading about Harry's summer and not just an abreviated version that left us guessing as to what he does before September.  I loved reading about all the familar characters.  She answered a lot of questions in this book.  I am only sorry I finished it so soon.
