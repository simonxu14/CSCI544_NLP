This book was BRILLIANT!! How she tied it all in I don't know.  I read it in 2 days, and if I didn't have kids to take care of I could have easily done it in 1.<br />She takes so many twists and turns in this one.  Just when you think you have it all figured out you find out you don't have a clue!! She answered all of my questions.  I love what she did with Snape and the Malfoys.  I thought the ending was great!!  I don't want to ruin it for anyone, so I will just say it will not diappoint, anyone who says otherwise must not have read the same book.<br />This book in an instant classic and a MUST READ!!
