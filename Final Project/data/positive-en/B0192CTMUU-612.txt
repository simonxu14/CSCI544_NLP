Powerful, well-told, fascinating. I could go on and on about the many positives of this book, but it would just get repetitive. So I'll just toss out three questions that I have about things that the nit-picker in me sees as possible plot-holes:<br /><br />1) Does anybody who's been following this series (and who hasn't?) really believe that Hermione wouldn't be able to find a spell as apparently obvious as the bubble-head charm (one which apparently Cedric Diggory was able to find on his own) given weeks to research it? I can just BARELY believe that she didn't know of it off the top of her head. I CANNOT accept that she couldn't find it given plenty of time for research.<br /><br />2) Given that Sirius is sufficiently worried about somebody intercepting the owls used to send mail to him that he wants different owls used each time, AND that he cautions Harry, Ron & Hermione not to use his real name but to refer to him as "Snuffles" when talking about him among themselves at school, WHY DOES HE SIGN HIS REAL NAME TO THE LETTERS HE SENDS HARRY?<br /><br />3) While we're on the subject of owls: if, as is apparently the case, owls are magically able to find whoever their message is addressed to, no matter how well hidden or disguised the person is (even using different owls every time, some of them school owls with no apparent special talents or knowledge of Sirius, Harry's messages always reached Sirius eventually) why, when Sirius escaped from Azkaban and was being hunted near and far as a dangerous escaped criminal, didn't the ministry simply write him a letter and then track the owl? Why doesn't Dumbledore simply write a letter to Voldemort and track the owl? Or, if Voldemort is considered too dangerous, Wormtail?<br /><br />Minor quibbles, all, but I must confess to being curious if there's an explanation for any of them.
