I bought this book for my grandchild and he was very happy with it.  He brings it everywhere he goes, and it helps him identify a character he wants to play when he is interacting with his friends.  The book has good user features like giving the phonetic pronunciation of each pokemon.  It also shows how each character evolves and if they evolve.  Great value for the price.
