I just got my copy deleivered yesterday morning by FedEx and finished reading it that night.  You won't be able to put it down! As usual, J.K. Rowling draws you into the world of Harry Potter and the most disappointing  part is finishing the last page. I wish book 5 was out already. One bonus:  we learn how to pronounce Hermione.
