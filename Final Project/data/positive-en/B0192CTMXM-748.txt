While the story is a bit clunky in places and has a feel of someone trying to clean up loose ends while distracted, it is still very enjoyable and you will like the finish. It's not the typical ending but a good ending for this story and in this author's opinion, leaves the door open for more or even fanv ersions of alternative storylines much like Star Wars and Star Trek. I ordered the audio CD version of the book and the UK version of the printed book. Jim Dale as in the past, is an excellent narrator of the story complete with his 130 or so voices (his number from an NPR interview).  I did use Audiobook Builder (OSX) to make my CDs into something that I could load on my iPod and still bookmark and have the proper names on each track. The book really does have a special feel when you listen to it because of JK's nicely done descriptions.  For the fan, I recommend that you try the audio version and listen to JK's world of wizardry and magic with Jim Dale. It can make the commute much more enjoyable and even make cleaning the kitchen a fun task. Unless you have some house elves help you.
