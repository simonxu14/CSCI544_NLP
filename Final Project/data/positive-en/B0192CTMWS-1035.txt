The first time i read Harry Potter I was 12 now I'm 19 and I still love every book in the series. The final book does not disappoint at all. J.K. covers everything that needed to be covered answered every question I had and helped to understand why she chose to end the book the way she did.If you are contemplating whether or not you should buy this book for your child or yourself....I believe you should buy it because there will never be a book that will open up your child's imagination and propel them to live a life full of happiness like Harry Potter will.
