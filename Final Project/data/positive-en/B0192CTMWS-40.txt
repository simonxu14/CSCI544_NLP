What an amazing story and an amazing series!!! I came in late to the Harry Potter fan club (just now reading the series) and all I have to say is: So while I was late to the party….what a party it was!!! What was I thinking? Not reading these!? A Sin! I have to say Rowling’s writing is amazing! I loved how she tied the series together. I also was quite in awe with the detail these books have and although I am heartbroken (Snape’s story line literally hurt me) this last book was amazing! There is nothing I can say to add to these reviews other than I am a Gryffindor for life!
