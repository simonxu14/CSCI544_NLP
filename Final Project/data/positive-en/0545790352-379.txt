I've always tried to remember what I thought the characters would look like before the movies came out and these illustrations just bring JK's description to life! Love the different medium. Great book. Very large letters if young kids were wanting to read. I also like the little attached string for the bookmark. Can't wait til Chamber of Secrets is released!
