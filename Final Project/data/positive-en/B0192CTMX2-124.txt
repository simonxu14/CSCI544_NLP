The perfect way to enjoy a long car ride.  I was nervous about purchasing a used copy but the seller was very accurate in that is was &#34;like new&#34; (at least with the first 10 cd's).  Much to my surprise, it came earlier than expected, making this an even better experience.  Now that we are home, we continue to listen to the beautiful story telling.  I'm a sucker for an accent and this delivers.  With all the media buzz around us, it is nice to take some time with the family and listen to a great story.
