JK Rowling managed to end the series in a way that tied up all loose endings.  It's amazing when you look back on the entire series how tightly everything fit together.  The middle of the book was a bit slow but the action-packed beginning and ending more than made up for it.  It's sad to say goodbye to Harry, Ron, Hermoine, Ginny, Hogwarts etc...
