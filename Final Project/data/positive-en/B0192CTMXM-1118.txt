Having read the whole book in one giant 10hr marathon, I can say this is really great. Like the other four in the series, it's quite a page turner, keeping the reader interested as Ms. Rowling propels the plot along. However, there is some slowness towards the front of the book that is to be expected. The book ends nicely starting from about page 600 or so, straight on to the end at page 870.<br />Certainly the most fun I have with a book since the last Harry Potter.
