After having read all four Harry Potter books three times each I am going through withdrawal. I wish I didn't have to wait a year or more for the next book so I bought the two schoolbooks. Of all the books I have read as an adult I have found some of the greatest reading joy in Harry Potter. Those of us who grew up as nerds, unathletic, and/or non-cliquey people will feel at home at Hogwarts. Those readers who haven't will still love reading these books. As each book unfolded I saw parallels between the Hogwarts world and the Star Wars films. Both promote a sense of  a loner learning to thrive in a world where you are just a little bit (or maybe more than a little) different from everyone else. Harry is creative, intelligent, and interesting You will find yourself rooting him on as each book finds him confronting evil and I'm not going to spoil anything by saying any details! Don't skip these books because  you consider yourself a &quot;grown-up&quot; and too adult to read them.
