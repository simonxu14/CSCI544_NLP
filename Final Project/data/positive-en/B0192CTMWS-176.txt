Book came in great condition, I will be a return customer to this buyer in the future. Growing up, these books changed my life. I started out as a struggling student in English class, and after a year I became an avid reader with good English skills. The books are very engaging! Book #7 almost completes my collection. If you haven't given this series a try yet, do it, you won't regret it :)
