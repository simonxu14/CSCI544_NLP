While this book started off a little slow (the first chapter not that great), the rest of the book was fantastic.  I recieved my book from Amazon  at noon on Saturday and have spent the last 30 hours reading it every spare  minute.<br />As usual the dialogue and characters are great.<br />Probably the  best of the series.
