I enjoyed the Harry Potter books for the first time with my son.  He is now 23, and we still enjoy watching the movies again from time to time.  I bought this audiobook to replace the cassette version we bought years ago.  The Prisoner of Azkaban and The Deathly Hallows are my two favorite HP books.
