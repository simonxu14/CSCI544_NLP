In his fifth year at Hogwarts, our favorite wizard, Harry Potter, finds himself battling more than just dementors, death eaters, potential murderers and bullies.  He fights the ultimate fight -- adolescence (complete with a crush).  Though longer than the last book, I found I was unable to put it down.  Questions we have had for years are answered and yet Rowling leaves us wondering just what is in store for our beloved hero in the next two books. An absolute must for any Harry Potter fan and if you haven't read them, you're missing a great story!  Well written and well worth the wait.  I can only hope it doesn't take another three years for the next one!
