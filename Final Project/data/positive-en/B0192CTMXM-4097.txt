I MUST NOT TELL LIES....I rarely find that final books, movies, etc. live up to expectations, especially ones generating such a mainstream buzz. But after nearly a decade of devotion, as a reader introduced to the series early, I am content with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. This is also exceptional because of the sheer enormity of the body count on this one, like the 2 books before it, most of the fallen turned out to be my favorite characters.  The author  had released before the release that two major characters who die. This is an understatement. Of course, plenty of death happen "off screen," TEN deaths are "major" players in the sense that they appear in 4-7 books!<br /><br />While J.K.Rowling avoids making this the largest novel in order to answer all the questions and plot requirements, she does do the finale staple in the referencing or return of many, many, many concepts, characters and catch-phases of the past 6 books. Settings, spells and special guest appearances are all welcome additions to HP VII.  Things big and small appear with parts to play: For example Dedalus Diggle, a very minor player, was the first wizard to appear in Book 1, and he is the first to do so here in the final story. Other characters returning in person or as a passing reference include the likes of: Mr. Ollivander, the surviving members of the Order and the D.A., the Malfoys, the Weasley's Ghoul, Stan Shunpike, Grindelvald, Nearly-Headless-Nick, Norbert, Bathilda Bagshot, R.A.B., Gregorovitch, Viktor Krum, the Lovegoods, house elves, Wormtail just  to name a few. Watch out for cameos or references to inanimate and animate objects like, Harry's first snitch, his invisibility cloak (which plays a major role ), the Monster Book of Monsters, the Whomping Willow, the Marauder's Map, pensieves, Polyjuice Potion,  and even Sirius' flying motorcycle as referenced early in Sorcerers' Stone.<br /><br />Book SIX focused on tracking down the Horcruxes or magical objects into which the Dark Lord Voldemort a.k.a Tom Riddle has divided his soul to be virtually immortal. Horcruxes we've seen the Diary, the Ring, the great snake Nagini and Voldemort himself. We get some insight into his history and plans, but by the end of Half-Blood Prince we have as more questions than answers.<br /><br />Questions ultimately answered in Book Seven:<br /><br />Is HARRY himself one of the remaining Horcruxes?<br />How to destroy them? How did Dumbledore destroy the ring?<br />Where is real locket Horcrux? Who is R.A.B.?<br />What becomes of Hogwarts?<br />Is Snape evil? Why did Dumbledore trust him?<br />Did Dumbledore have a plan?<br />What are the Deathly Hallows? What is Voldemort's ultimate goal?<br />Must HARRY die to stop Voldemort?<br />What did Dumbledore really see in the Mirror of Erised, back in Book 1?<br /><br />BOOK 7... Careful some plot spoilers below.......<br /><br />This one opens with scenes behind enemy lines, revealing Harry's 17th birthday and the end of his protection from the Dark Lord is fast approaching. The Death Eaters are ready for the Order's plan to move Harry to a safe house. Following a down-rite heart warming good-bye to the Dursleys, the action-packed escape ends with the loss of more than just Harry's broom, but two friends fall as his childhood innocence is symbolically stripped from him. Things slow-down just long enough for The Wedding, before the chill is off the drinks all hell breaks lose and Harry's quest begins again for the "you know whats" and this time Harry's archetype takes on literal interpretation as his searches for a sword, "the Sword of Gryffindor"  possibly the only way to finish his assignment for Dumbledore.<br />The Sword is at Hogwarts and Hogwarts is again controlled by the Ministry, but a corrupt or controlled government which has placed Snape as Headmaster. He has the Sword in Dumbledore's office, or does he? This quest and the search for the Horcruxes lead Harry back to the ex-headquarters of the Order, Grimmauld Place where he makes things right with Kreacher, the house elf willed to Harry along with the family estate itself.<br />Harry visits his own family's home which has become a memorial of sorts like GRACELAND. I think Hermione would disapprove of the graffiti there as well. Before this there is a daring visit to the "Muggle-Born Registration Commission. Forced further into hiding the trio learn more of Dumbledore's early history, the tale of the 3 Brothers and possible revelations about Harry's cloak.<br /><br />The Sword is recovered by a Gryffindor other than Harry, but pulled from a lake like the Arthur archetype. Harry learns the hard way that there is power and fear in a name as the taboo on the Dark Lords name leads to the trio's capture and imprisonment at Malfoy Manor where Voldemort himself is a house-guest. Wormtail makes good on his debit to Harry. Ultimately they escape at the cost of a friend's LIFE along with fellow prisoners: Griphook the Goblin, Luna Lovegood and wandmaker Ollivander. They learn lots of wand lore that will be Harry's key weapon in his "final" battle with the Dark Lord, the "Elder Wand" will be the deciding force. Griphook will lead Harry and friends as they break into the best protected place in the wizarding world Gringotts Bank in order to claim a Horcrux. Are there really Dragons and traps protecting the place? Griphooks price for this good deed?<br /><br />During return to HOGWARTS, new secret entrance to the school is revealed, along with a character previously only referenced Aberforth Dumbledore, who reveals his late brother's motivating guilt. Also the D.A. are summoned, among others to help Harry in his final quest. Harry up to this point has walked a fine line, between falling into the traps that both Tom Riddle and Dumbledore fell. The desire for the "Greater Good" costing a lot of lives. For all of his trust in people Dumbledore's greatest weakness was his secretiveness, and it cost both him and Harry plenty. Meanwhile, Harry risks his life turning away from killing whenever possible, Lupin even calls him on this early in this story. Harry here makes a choice to include the D.A., his friends & students from Hogwarts in his last mission for Dumbledore.  This final battle at the school sees the return of many magical forces from the Forest and more. What begins as a play for time becomes the end of the war. The cast of characters and tied up plot lines is enormous here, Ron proves his worth and cleverness in "now or never" moments while Neville Longbottom proves himself a true Gryffindor as well.<br /><br />Fear not there is an epilogue that is a satisfying bookend for the series as is the entire novel, "An exceptionally satisfying bookend to an exceptional series" that will live on long past the final Hollywood interpretations, as surely as THE CHUDLEY CANNONS will rank bottom of this years LEAGUE!!"<br /><br />Thanks J.K.<br /><br />Long live Gryffindor, where dwell the Brave at Heart!
