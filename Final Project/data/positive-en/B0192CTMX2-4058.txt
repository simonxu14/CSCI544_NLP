J.K. is a wonderful writer.  These stories are going to be read and treasured 100 years from now - like we read Dickens today.  Boy, after reading this book, the characters are that much more real to me - I feel like I know the main characters.  I really felt Harry's pain throughout this book, and at the end of the story.  He is no longer a child.  He had to learn a lesson the hard way - not altogether his own fault.<br />In the next two books, Harry will be a young man.  Hope his sixth year is easier than his fifth year.  When's the next train back to Hogworts?
