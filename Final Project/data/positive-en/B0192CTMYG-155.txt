After learning Korean, I wanted to read my all-time favourite series in it. Granted, there are going to be quite a few differences due to the language change, but it still paints the picture and drags you into the the fabulous and magical world of Harry Potter.<br /><br />I wish I could write more, but it's 2011! I'm pretty sure everyone knows Harry Potter and as read the first book by now. X3
