JK Rowling has done it again!  There are some things in the book that caused us Potter fans to yell out "That's just Wrong!" but the incidents fit in well.  Just upsets us when bad things happen to great characters!<br />Not sure about the ending...maybe wishing there was a bit more insight there into adult Harry.  Good way to finish the series.  What's next, JK?
