The final book flows nicely and keeps you involved in the developements. I marvel at JK Rowlings mind and conception of the whole Harry Potter series. This book does very well in bringing the problem of Lord Voldemort to a conclusion. To me a unique conclusion.  However, it does skip 19 years at the end. So maybe that will lead to another book and then again maybe not.
