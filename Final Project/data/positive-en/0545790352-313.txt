Absolutely gorgeous!!!!  My 4 year old is obsessed with Harry Potter and this book was a reward for being such a great big sister.  She loves it, and it's the perfect balance between a fully illustrated children's book & an all text book.  This book is the perfect book to help introduce your child to imaganitive reading!
