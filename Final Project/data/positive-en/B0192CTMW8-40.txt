Still after all the years that have gone by, this book makes me fall in love with the wizard's world all over again.<br />I purchased all the books as they came out years ago but to have them at my finger tips whenever I want to read them again is really cool.<br />My soon grew up to me reading the books to him until he was 8.<br />He has the books now, I like the trade off.<br />Imaginative, character building and daring in her writing, J.K. Rowling will never disappoint with the Harry Potter series.
