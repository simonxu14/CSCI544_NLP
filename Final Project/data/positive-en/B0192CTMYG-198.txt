This is a classic children's book that will endure the test of time. Mark my words. We are immediately drawn to Harry, Hermione, and Ron and the wonderful adult influences in their lives. Hagrid, the lovable giant that is every child's dream friend, wise Prof. Dumbledore, and stern Prof. McGonagall. I run the Harry Potter Book and Movie Clubs of NYC and am thrilled to see that a new generation of children are just as thrilled with the books as my first club members. Now they have a cover that they can call their own. Kazu Kibuishi has done a fantastic job. I'm enjoying this 10th reading almost as much as I did my first. Well done!
