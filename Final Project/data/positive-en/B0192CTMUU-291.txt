Well, I purchased the book back in the summer when it came out waiting impatiently for the Winter holiday so that I could really sit down and savor this huge tome when I had some time off to do so properly!  It was worth the wait! Incredible that is was even better than I could have imagined.  Simply riveting.  I love the way Ms. Rowling has brought children and adults back to reading. She is an amazing writer and I love the world that she has created.
