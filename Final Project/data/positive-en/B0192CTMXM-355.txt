The last book in the series ... hard to please everyone because we all want something different from these characters that we have followed for the past few years.  The last chapter was unnecessary, but there were many chapters that were brilliant which made up for the epilogue.  Suffice it to say, at our coed book club, we talked for over an hour about the hidden meanings, plot twists, symbolism, parallels to Nazi Germany, the presence of spirituality within the book, etc.  For a children's book, it has some deep meanings, and some stirring outcomes for sideline characters such as Neville Longbottom, and Luna Lovegood.
