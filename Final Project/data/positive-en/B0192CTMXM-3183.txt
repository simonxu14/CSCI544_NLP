I remember the first time I ever heard about Harry Potter. It was when I was a school librarian and I was having a book fair (supported by Scholastic) and  my students were buying it up like wild fire.  I decided to pick up the first book and read it, and after that, I quickly read the Chamber of Secrets and the Prisoner of Azkaban.  I was hooked, and it was then that I understood why my students would fight over getting a copy to check out of the library each week.  Like everyone else who loves Harry Potter, I had to wait each time for the next installment to come out and I was very excited each time a new title was released.  The series is a fabulous series by a very talented author.  This last installment will not disappoint the avid Harry Potter fan.  It is action packed with  a lot of adventure and suspense, and a few nail biting parts that will really make your heart race.  It is the PERFECT end to the series, and I think, provides a good deal of closure for those of us that will be suffering from "Harry withdraw".  Definitely worth the money, and the time it takes to read it.  A must have for anyone who has collected the other 6 in the series.
