I have read the other three Harry Potter books, and I loved all of them.  This book was no exception.  The plot was very interesting and suspenseful.  There are many twists that will keep you reading!  In this book Harry's  fight against the evil dark wizard, Voldemort, continues.  Many interesting  facts about Voldemort's past get revealed. This was by far the most  &quot;adult&quot; oriented book of the four Harry Potter books.  But I  believe that it is appropriate for all ages.  If this is your first  experience with Harry Potter I would recommend reading the other three  books first.  I think you could enjoy reading this book if you had never  read another Harry Potter book but a lot of the references to past books  would be lost.  However, J.K. Rowling does do a good job of  briefly  paraphrasing some of the major events from the other books.
