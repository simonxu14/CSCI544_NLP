I was not sure just what a 'Library Binding Edition' was all about.  It is an extra heavy (durable) binding - I guess to withstand heavy usage.  I very much like the weight of it.  The retailer sent it along quite promptly.  And in new condition as advertised.  The story, of course, speaks for itself.  I cannot say that I enjoyed the ending - but, the journey was entertaining!
