The book arrived at noon on the 21st of July by mail. My college aged daughter cried, groaned, moaned, squealed until I was ready to take the book away from her. Being a fairly nice mom, I didn't. By 1 a.m., my daughter had finished it. I started on it that night & finished it the next day (Sunday). The plot swoops, twirls, runs & roars with action. There is a lull in the middle, but I found it nice to catch my breath. Could the book have been better? Maybe. But it certainly kept our attention for the duration of our reading. J.K. Rowlings is one of the richest women in the world by virtue of writing the Harry Potter series. She deserves it. She has brought my daughters & me much entertainment over the years. We've all read each book several times & probably will continue to do so. Many children have read all of her books, while many adults won't read more than a magazine article. Getting kids excited about reading adds to the worthiness of this series.
