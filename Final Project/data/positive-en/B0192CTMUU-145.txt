J.K. Rowling has written yet another wonderful work about Harry Potter and his time at Hogwarts. I read it all in one day -- I didn't want to stop reading. The book didn't seem excessively long to me. In fact, it seemed almost too short -- not once did I wish that the part I was reading would go faster. I read a LOT of books, and I haven't had that happen since I read "The Gripping Hand" by Larry Niven.<br />It appears now that the first 3 books were merely prelude to the "real" story that begins with this book. "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" answers some questions, but asks even more. It's a perfect "to be continued...." kind of book, because it left me feeling like a complete story was told, but also feeling anxious for more.<br />Harry is 3 years older than he was in the first book, and it shows. He is entering the most harrowing, spine-chilling, frightening period of his life -- he's discovering girls. Also, a very powerful evildoer is trying to kill him. It's almost a toss-up which gives him and his friends the most trouble, at least early on. It's nice to read a series of books about teenagers who actually age and change. Nobody worry, though. Harry's still a really nice boy, even if he is still somewhat of a typical teenager. After all, teenage life is hard enough even without people trying to kill you, and Harry has all the troubles of young adulthood. In short, he's growing up, and just in time, too.<br />The new characters introduced in this book are excellent, and serve to advance (and, in some cases, twist) the plot quite well. I'm looking forward to seeing some of them in future books. I'm also becoming very curious about Snape... but I'm sure we'll find out more in the next book.<br />In conclusion: A great book! Buy it now! Buy copies for your family and friends! :-) I hope you all love it as much as I did. The only problem is, now I can't wait for the next book to come out! Write faster, J.K.! :-)
