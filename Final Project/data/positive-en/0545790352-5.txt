I am a huge Harry Potter fan so of course I had to pre-order this edition for my birthday.  I am so glad that I did, it is so beautiful.  The book is big, and full of beautiful pictures, it also has a red ribbon bookmark attached which I love.  I think this is a great way to get my son and daughter interested in reading the books as well.  A must have for any Harry Potter fan, or anyone interested in reading the books alone or with children.  The children will be enticed by the beautiful pictures throughout the book
