I read this book a few years ago, when the the thrill of Harry was in it's prime.  I've seen the movie more times than I can count and I must say the movie is excellent but not as good as the book.  I've just reread this book and can't beleive all I had forgotten.  It's truly a page turner.  From the start when Harry spots the Grim to when Mr Weasley warns Harry of Sirius Black's escape and hunt for Harry the reader is hooked.  The Maurader's Map is a great addition to the Invisibility Cloak.  The first 2 books were good, but you truly don't get into Harry until this book.  Ron and Hermione's relationship is beginning to bud.  Hermione is truly the goody goody in this installment.  There were times I was mad at her with Ron and Harry.  Getting the history of Harry's father's friends helped the story advance with background.  This book also helps paint the picture of Snape and his hatered for Harry.  The introduction of the Patronus is excellent.  It's just as amazing in the book and the movie did a great job of reproducing it.  All in all, I loved this book and recommend it to everyone who enjoys magic and fantasy reads.
