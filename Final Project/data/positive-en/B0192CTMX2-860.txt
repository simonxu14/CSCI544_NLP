There are so many reviews here that this book certainly doesn't need one from me but I wanted to say I loved it. I've read all the others and was looking forward to this one,too. I'm very pleased that Rowling chose to end the book the way she did. It was satisfying and sweet.<br /><br />Harry Potter is the classic Hero's Journey --- Joseph Campbell would have loved it. It has all the elements of great, classic adventure and the triumph of good over evil. Plus it has the addition of some of the most wonderful characters a reader could ask for. I'm sorry the series has ended and I know that the entire Weasley family, Sirius and Mad-eye and Lupin, all those great kids and, of course, Harry, will always be characters in my internal world. I think I'll miss Luna most of all.<br /><br />Thanks, Ms. Rowling for the magic. In a world that can be trying at times, it is deeply appreciated.
