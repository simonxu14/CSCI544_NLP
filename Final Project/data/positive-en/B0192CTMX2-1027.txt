Entertaining as the last one, maybe more so.  I love the details about day-to-day life at Hogwarts.  The world that Rowling has created comes into light more and more and the detail becomes more visible as you read the books. I can almost smell the smells and feel the textures at Hogwarts. The characters, which were always well-developed and multi-dimensional, are even more vivid in Book 5. It's a great escape; she really transports you into their world. One minor warning: this is probably not appropriate for young or sensitive children.  But for the rest of us, it's great.
