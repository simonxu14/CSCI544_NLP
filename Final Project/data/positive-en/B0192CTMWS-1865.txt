The last Harry Potter was very, very well thoughtout, and I was scared to read it at first in fear that too many people will die who are main characters, and even though people did die, it was very reasonable and I understood it had to be done, though it was saddening. It was complicated but I love the way Harry won victory, and the truth was finally revealed, and all your questions were answered. A great book, and I love how Rowling wrote it. Spellbinding and wonderful. Rowling has such a big imagination that you will come to admire in all Harry Potter books, but especially in this one. To me, this was my favorite Harry Potter book and I felt like hugging it after reading it. A long but worhtwhile read! Words can't express my admiration for Rowling! I LOVE HARRY POTTER!
