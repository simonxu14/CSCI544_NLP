Don't worry about the size of this book. It is fast reading, with the same fast-paced drama as the first four. The story of Potter's latest chills, thrills and some frills, hasn't suffered from sequelitis. On the contrary, Rowling continues to impress with simply excellent character development, timing, drama and intrigue.<br />You'll find it has shorter descriptions of classroom lessons and quidditch. What it does have more of is drama, with many interweaving stories. It has a love angle, a secret society, an undercurrent of Voldemort's latest plan, and a lot of authority vs. righteous teen rebels. You'll find yourself wanting to shout "don't" at Harry, like when you're watching a horror flick. However, it never gets cheesy and there is just the right amount of suspense and missteps to keep you interested.<br />Thanks Rowling! You deserve every dollar of your billions.
