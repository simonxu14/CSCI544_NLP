I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS ILLUSTRATED VERSION OF HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE! To give you some background, I have the complete set for Harry Potter, and The Hogwarts Library and this book topped everything! It made me feel like my childhood is finally complete especially because the illustrations are so beautifully and lavishly drawn by Jim Kay (if you don't know him, he also drew A Monster's Call by Patrick Ness). It definitely brings every character to life and this book review definitely does not do their collaboration any justice. If you have a kid who cannot seem to finish the unillustrated versions, get them this book and they will love you for life!
