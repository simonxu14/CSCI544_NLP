Saving the best for last this book this book sends Harry and his contemporaries off with flare, excitement, and style. In the style of CS Lewis and JRR Tolkien, where the best presentations of faith are indirect ones, good triumphs over evil once more. Many loose ends are tied up - some still reamain for the reader to descern for themselves. This book is a page turner for Harry fans though I can't see anyone not totally tuned into the series enjoying it simply for what it is. I thoroughly enjoyed this series - which started off as childrens books but did not necessarily end as such.  These stories matured with Harry and once the charm of the fantasy community were thoroughly engrained in the readers knowledge base the stories became more complex.  Thank you Ms. Rowling for sharing your fantasy.
