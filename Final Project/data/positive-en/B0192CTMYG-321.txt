I read many of these reviews before I purchased this book, and found the clains hard to believe!  Well, I believe them now!  This is a wonderful, exciting read for kids and adults!  My boys are 8, 10 and 14, I encouraged  my oldest to listen in because the reviews were so good.  Much to my  surprise after we read chapter 3 he came up to me and whispered in my ear,  &quot;Can I read ahead&quot;?  :-)  I told him absolutely NOT, it's a  family thing and he would have to wait like the rest of us!  :-)  He teased  as if he were asking to go and hang out with his friends...this can only be  a good thing.  I did have to take measures; as one other reader suggested,  she had to find a good hiding place for the book so there were no cheaters!  This is a terrific way to show your kids that reading is for  pleasure...not just something you HAVE to do for an assignment at school!
