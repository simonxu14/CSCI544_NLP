"Order of the Phoenix" is the best audio book of the Harry Potter series. It's not just Rowling's writing, but the vocal work of her narrator, Jim Dale. He is the "voice" of the series and does a fabulous job narrating the HP books (I have all of the audio books including "Half-Blood Prince"). However, he is brilliant in "Order of the Phoenix" with his vocal characterizations and the high level of excitement. I had to wait in my car in the parking garage at work until disc 1 finished - I couldn't stop! No wonder it won Audio Book of the Year from Audiophile. Jim Dale is the best vocal narrative actor around for audio books.
