If you are the kind of Harry Potter fan that has to have everything, then you probably have considered purchasing the Collector's editions. This Collector's Edition is very similar in binding and looks to its predecessor, Sorcerer's Stone, and markedly different from the last two Collector's Editions, Order of the Phoenix and Half- Blood Prince. It is my honest opinion that if you are looking to invest in a collector's edition of any of the HP books, the first two are the most handsome and display- worthy. The "Box set" feel of the latter two Collector's editions are lovely, however the bindings are no different than the Hardcover editions (although the dust jacket artworks are unique to the collector's editions). The first two Collector's editions are a leather binding, with gilded page edges and have the feel of a true collectable for adults.<br /><br />This edition of Chamber of Secrets is bound in red leather with a lightweight, translucent plastic dust cover to protect the leather. The leather binding is very tight and clean and the gilded page edges can suffer a fair ammount of page flicking without flaking or rubbing off. It also includes a small piece of jacket art (same artwork from the dust jacket of the hardcover edition) that would be suitable for framing. This edition would be better kept away from the hands of children if you want your copy to stay clean and pristine.<br /><br />I have to honestly say that my favorite portion of this edition is the spine of the book, which is just beautiful to look at in red leather and gold lettering, and Harry's lightning- shaped scar in gold along the spine adds a touch of whimsey, reminding the reader that, as beautiful as this binding is, this is a book about fun and adventure for all ages.<br /><br />If you are looking for a Harry Potter collectable edition, this one is by far my favorite.
