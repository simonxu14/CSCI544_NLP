Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows lived up to all my expectations and went beyond.  Rowling is truly a master in capturing one's imagination.  I was completely enthralled in the story from the first page to the last...I must admit that reading it with a British accent in my head makes the story even more enchanting!  I love the little life lessons Rowling weaves into this series and brings them all together in the final chapters.  A must read for kids of all ages!  My only disappointment was the use of two rather strong swear words in the book.  As a classroom teacher, that would most likely eliminate the possibility of reading this aloud to my students.
