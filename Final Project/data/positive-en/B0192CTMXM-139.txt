What an amazing rollercoaster ride.  I read it in two nights, and would have done so in one had my body been willing.  Book 7 is definitely the climax of the series, with the action starting right from the start and never ending.  So many pieces fall together in this book, but it's all done so suspensefully that you don't feel like you are just listening to lots of talk.  WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Rowling, I'm going to miss this series.  I hope you reconsider and write more about these characters (prior or future generations, for example) down the road.
