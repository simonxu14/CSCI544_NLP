Once again, JK Rowling has come through with an exciting and realistic book. Realistic in that teenagers do go through times when they are unreasonably moody. I read it in about five days, mostly on the bus to and from work and at lunch - averaging about 125 pages per day.<br />Now I can hardly wait for the next one!
