Again, J.K. Rowling has led me into the wondrous world of wizardry in a thouroughly wonderful way. I felt weightlessly transported right into the magical milieu of Harry, Hermione, Ron and all the other colorful characters and personalities of Hogwarts as if I were right amongst them sharing all of their awesome adventures.<br />This generation of readers is fortunate to have Ms. Rowling to lead them into the realm of reading in such a compelling manner.
