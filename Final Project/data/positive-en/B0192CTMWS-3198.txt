Ditto to all the positive reviews you've read, flawed, but entertaining and gripping until the end. The contents of the book were wonderful, the physical properties of the book were less so, read below:<br /><br />(Warning - big whiny complaining story follows) My complaint is with the construction of the book rather than the contents. My first copy started to peel away from the glue of the spine during the first reading. It parted company completely and we returned it. The second copy was barely opened when it fell apart. I contacted Scholastic and after some back and forth, they agreed to send a new copy out to me. I don't expect it to hold up any better than the previous two, but we'll see.<br /><br />Since the Harry Potter series will join the Chronicles of Narnia, the Chronicles of Prydain, the Lord of the Ring series and anything written by Robert A. Heinlein as books I hope that my grandchildren will read and enjoy, I expect better than the shoddy  workmanship shown here. Scholastic's first email said that since they'd had such a big job printing 12 million copies, I should expect defects!
