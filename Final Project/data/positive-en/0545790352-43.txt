I love the Harry Potter books and I wanted to get this to introduce my 7 year old son to the series that I grew up with. I also wanted it for my collection.<br /><br />The illustrations in this book are more beautiful than I thought they would. They make the book come to life in a way that is making my very non interested son into a very interested little boy. He is becoming more intrigued into the world that I loved. I am excited to share it with him.<br /><br />I haven't had a problem with my copy falling apart or anything. It is holding up very well to my son and I taking turns reading.<br /><br />I honestly cannot express how beautiful the illustrations are in this book.
