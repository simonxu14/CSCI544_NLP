This book is absolutely stunning. The artwork is just so gorgeous and goes along perfectly with this wonderful story. It is also a very large, heavy, well made book so it can stand up to some use as my children and I read it. We are currently reading this book for bedtime reading and all three children love to listen and look as I turn the pages. This would be a fantastic gift for any Harry Potter fan but I think that it can especially help to get younger children into the magical world of Harry Potter. I cannot recommend this book enough!  Buy it, you will not be disappointed!
