This play wonderfully portrayed a very different world of magic. The tone of the writing is different, but the fantastic way it tickles the imagination is very much present. If one is counting on the play to be like Harry Potter, I am afraid one might experience disappointment.  This is not a prelude, although,  familiar characters are mentioned. This is instead, a wonderful snippet of the magical world. Well worth the read.
