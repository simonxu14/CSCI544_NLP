I know the Fourth Book in the Harry Potter series is Harry Potter and the  Goblet of Fire.  Why then is this listing still up?  Could Doomspell  Tournament possibly be the name of Book 5?<br />By the way, I loved Harry  Potter and the Goblet of Fire.  It had much more detail than the others (of  course!) and the characters are all back for more.  I can't wait to see  what happens next!
