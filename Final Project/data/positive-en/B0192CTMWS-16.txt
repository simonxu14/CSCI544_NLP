After reading the first two books in two days flat, I was dying to get to the third. Fortunately, it came out about six days later.  As I finished that one at 4 the next morning, I'm in quite a bind until the next one.  These books are some of the best I've ever read.  J.K. Rowling has an  amazing gift, and I hope she continues to share it for the next hundred  years or so!  Harry, Ron, Hagrid, and Hermione are wonderful, and Malfoy  and the Slytherins are perfectly horrid.  I like that the books have all  the wonder and intensity of childhood as well as a very adult eye for  character.  It is impossible for me to express how much I love this book,  and the other two.  The plot was even better(if that's  possible)this time  around.  The twists and turns kept me riveted, and the ending was so  bittersweet!  At least we know that Harry's not completely alone, though.  I hope we see more development of that in future books, as I liked that  character a lot(don't want to name names and spoil it).  To sum it all up,  this was a wonderful, amazing book, and I really can't wait for the next  one!  Thanks, Mrs. Rowling, for the pleasure of your books.
