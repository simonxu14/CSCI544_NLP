A truly fantastic reprint! I was expecting the illustrations to be somewhat sparse, but there's rarely two or three pages without an illustration. The illustrations themselves are gorgeous. Incredibly well done and close to the source material. I typically associate Harry Potter imagery with the films, so it was fun to see everything re-imagined. This was given as a gift and the recipient absolutely adored it. I highly recommend it for any Harry Potter lovers in your life.
