At first, I thought Harry Potter books were little kids' books and didn't feel much interest in them. Then I saw lots of people talking about them, and bought the first book out of curiosity, and started reading it.<br /><br /> I was hooked!<br /><br />I bought this book (HP & the Deathly Hallows) awhile ago and have read it three times (along with the whole Harry Potter series of books) - and enjoyed them all as much as the first time! I'm now a Harry Potter fan, and I think the books and the movies are among the most fun and entertaining books/movies I've experienced. After finishing the series, each time, I was left not wanting the story to end!
