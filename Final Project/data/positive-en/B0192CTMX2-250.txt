I have a question for anyone who has read both the UK adult version and the US version of the Harry Potter series.<br /><br />I have also followed through all of the Harry Potter books and movies. Being just over 50, I was surprised at how easily the books and movies pulled me into the delightful world of Harry Potter. I have relatives in their 70's who have been just as steadfast at following the series and reading all of the books. It is a wonderful thing how this series instilled the love of reading to an entire generation (and then some). Reading books had almost become a lost art until Harry Potter came along.<br /><br />My question on the UK adult version of the Harry Potter books...... Are they different from the US standard hardback version which we have been buying from Amazon? I bought the entire series through Amazon and on the last book, I bought the deluxe US version with the illustrations.<br /><br />I'm wondering if there is a difference in the writing or additional info in the UK adult version. If there is more to read which I have not yet seen, then I would want to buy those as well... but I thought I would  put this question to those who have read both versions to find out whether there is more to read in the UK versions.<br /><br />I would hope Rowling changes her mind and adds more books to the series. There is an endless number of storylines she could continue into their adult lives for deacades to come and it does not have to be focused on Voldemort. She could write a story about a virus among the magical world which affects their powers with Hermione as a Doctor or medical researcher at St Mungo's trying to find a cure to the ailing wizards and witches who don't know how to cope without powers... and muggles who catch the virus could gain powers which go haywire. The storylines have endless possibilites. Perhaps if Rowling changes her publisher's contract to not have a hard schedule like the previous series, she can take more time to enjoy writing without  harsh deadlines now that the characters ages for the movies are no longer an issue once the seventh movie is completed.<br /><br />I still think Mrs Norris, the cat, was Filtches former lover who was turned into a cat by her husband which is why Mr Filtch is so devoted to the cat. I know there is a storyline in that which has not yet been explored.
