I have seldom encountered any book that demands the sobriquet "you can't put it down."  This is one of them.  From the shocking chapter one through the climax 30 something chapters later, the story is instense and intensely moving.  Almost all of the questions raised in the various discussion groups were answered.  There are moments that will elicit tears - and not all of them are associated with death.  There are also surprises.  Yes, despite every kind of guess work, JKR manages to pull a few surprises out that are both moving and surprising.  From the battle at Hogwarts, through the moment Harry enters the forest to face He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named to the end, few readers can stop reading (or crying).<br /><br />Some will not like the epilogue.  I found it satisfying and, based on JKR's own comments on NBC last evening, it is clear that there were very good reasons for its inclusion.  NO SPOILERS HERE, SORRY.<br /><br />(I can say that the one person who was reprieved from death received that reprieve in book 5.)
