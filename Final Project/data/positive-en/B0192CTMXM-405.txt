AWESOME!!!  Last summer I decided to read the series.  I was enthralled from the start.  Little bumpy with Book 5, but the rest were phenomenal. I don't normally read this type of book (I am 52) but was pleasantly surprised how wrapped up I became.  I can't imagine reading one book and then waiting a year or so for the next one to be published!!! Glad I read them all back-to-back.  I can not wait for movies 6 and 7 .... good stuff!!!!
