This novel is an excellent continuation of the Harry Potter saga.  As with the other books we find out more about Harry as well as You-Know-Who and his minions.<br />From a literary standpoint this book makes an excellent  addition.  I couldn't get through the book without referring back tothe  perivious ooks and marvel at Ms. Rowlings consistency across books.<br />Fans  of Quidditch may be alternately pleased and disappointed with this novel.  Quidditch, the sporting event which life at Hogsworth seems to revolve  round, makes less of an appearence in this book.  We get to see the World  Cup game (which is over relatively quickly), but the Quidditch tournament  at Hogsworth is replaced by a new event, the Triwizard Tournament.  The  Tournament pits the top student from each of three wizard academies (yes,  Hogsworth has competition) against each other in a dangerous competition  for the honor of the schools.<br />As an avid reader of mysteries I tend to  figure out the mysteries well before the end of the book.  Ms. Rowling,  however, constantly manages to keep me guessing (often wrongly) about who  is behind the problems Harry encounters.  It is a complete pleasure to be  surprised at the end of a Harry Potter book.<br />If you've enjoyed the  previous books you'll love this new addition.  If you haven't read the  books yet, read them!  This is the best series I've read in a long time.
