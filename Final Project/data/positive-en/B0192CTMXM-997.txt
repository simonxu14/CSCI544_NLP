While I loved all of Harry Potter books, this one was far and away my favorite.  It just had a much more personal feel about Harry and his family, perhaps because I've read so much about them, they feel like family.<br />With a lot of sequals, the books start loosing something as they keep going, this one is the opposite, as the students at Hogwarts grow  so do their characters.  The author does a magnificent job in aging her  characters.<br />I found myself after this book worrying that there will  only be seven in this series and it just doesn't seem like enough.  I  recommend this to people of all ages, all will enjoy it.
