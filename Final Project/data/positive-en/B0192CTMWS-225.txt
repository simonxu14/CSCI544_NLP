Before I read this book, I could not order a Phoenix.  Now I can.  They never get delivered but progress is encouraging even if the final results are not achieved.  I deserve a participation trophy for ordering-challenged humanoids.<br />But seriously, Harry Potter is fictional right? Right? So, how could it be wrong?
