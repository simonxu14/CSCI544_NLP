As a 64-year-old-child I must admit, this book sucked me in from the beginning. From the beginning of the series to the last word, I loved just about all of it. But I still think  Hermionie (sp) should have wound up together. And the movie cast that useless person as that useless Ginny. HOW DID SHE GET THAT JOB???? Useless and completely non talented. Probably some wealthy person's child.
