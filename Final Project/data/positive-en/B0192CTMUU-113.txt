The book and dust cover arrived in perfect condition with no creases or tears. Mint condition, first edition, perfect!<br /><br />Many people didn't care for the Goblet of Fire, but I can't understand why that is. It's longer which is a plus for me as I love my Harry Potter fix. It delved into the everyday lives, struggles, and thought processes of the characters and studied them more which was very interesting, entertaining and fun. It also kept building up to a year's end which was epic in every way imaginable.<br /><br />J.K. Rowling is a master with twist endings and misleading her readers to think they know everything that's going on the school of Hogwarts, only to school them in just how powerful magic is and what can happen when that power is put in the wrong hands. If you're a fan of the first three books, keep reading. It only gets better from here on.
