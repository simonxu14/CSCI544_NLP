What can you say about this series? It has all been said. As I embarked on this magnificent story over seven years ago, I knew I would dislike when it ended. This seventh and final edition of Mr. Potter is more than I could have ever hoped for. I dislike that Dumbledore was killed - however, when the first actor who played Dumbledore died (Richard Harris) it was only fitting that the character die as well - as NO ONE - not even his son - could replace the energy he brought to that role.<br /><br />However, I digress. Every story Ms. Rowling writes takes me on an inner landscape ride of enormous proportions - into my imagination which is filled with all sorts of wonderful characters and the story she tells captivates my very soul. All the cantankerous arguments about this story, about her, the spectulations have all ended now. As I look back I know I was part of an epic story, an epic milestone in children's literature and I am proud to be a part of it.<br /><br />The story will continue on as the movies will be out forever and so will my memories. There is only one Harry Potter and he was a magnificent story that will live forever in my psyche. The way the story ended was excellent - I will keep my promise to Ms. JK - read the story for yourself and be mystified by the brilliance of this writer and learn to lesson from all seven books - never quit, keep going despite how you are treated, how much interference there is, even if you doubt yourself - keep going - endless effort - and your reward will be Peace.<br /><br />A very well written book - worthy of compliments and awards from this generation to the next. Well done JK, well done.
