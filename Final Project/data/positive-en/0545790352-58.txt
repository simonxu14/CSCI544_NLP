Beautiful book! I'm so excited that an illustrated version of the Harry Potter books are in the making! The artwork is just amazing and so lively and colorful. It brings a whole new atmosphere and feeling to the book. I've yet to look at all the illustrations while reading, but I'm excited to begin.<br />I believe this set is a must have for any Harry Potter fan's bookcase! Don't hesitate, just get it!
