I am a die hard Harry Potter fan and have been collecting the various editions of the series for many years now, a love I have passed on to my now ten-year-old daughter. When I saw this illustrated edition, my initial impression was that it was going to be a graphic novel, but it has exceeded all my expectations as this is the entire first novel (not abridged) with illustrations. How wonderful! Imagine a new generation of young fans being introduced to this stellar series that made readers out of legions of young readers? The possibilities are heartening indeed.<br /><br />The book is an over-sized hardcover with a lovely red satin ribbon page marker. The dimensions measure 10.9 x 9.7 x 1.2 inches. It is stated on one of the front pages that the paper is sourced from responsible sources. The book is then divided into seventeen chapters and each chapter is lushly illustrated with the beautiful illustrations of award-winning artist Jim Kay. The illustrations add a depth of aesthetic pleasure to the reading of this wonderful novel, and fans of Harry Potter will relish each illustration, big or small. There are full page depictions in sumptuous color, and smaller artistic depictions, as well as tiny accents that come together to tell this tale of the Boy Who Lived.<br /><br />There's Hagrid, rendered in watercolor, zooming on his motorbike, on his way to deposit the infant Harry at Privet Drive. Harry's cramped quarters in the cupboard under the stairs is dark and musty as I imagined it, with spiders and an abandoned teddy inhabiting the small space. There's touches of humor to the illustrations (let's face it, the story is amazing but in this edition, the illustrations are the highlight) - here's young Dudley on one page, facing a gorilla on the other page , that looks remarkably like Dudley, &#34;except it wasn't blond.&#34;<br /><br />Diagon Alley is imagined in a creative manner with the buildings all assembled in a hodge-podge fashion, and in a chaotic, messy way, reflecting the wizards of many talents and persuasions that visit and do business there. Hogwarts Express is depicted in majestic fashion and quite took my breath away. This is a book that my daughter and I will peruse again and again and never tire of it.<br /><br />Professors Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Snape get full-page treatments (I confess I would not have imagined McGonagall the way the artist depicted her). My one complaint? Hermione does not get much attention here, which annoyed us both as we are great fans of Ms. Granger. Oh well, they shall just have to remedy the situation and do much better in the next book :-) We for one, cannot wait!
