I very much enjoyed this book... except for a few nitpicks.  Firstly:<br />Harry's constant angst.  Yes, I know he's had a lot happen to him in the past few years, but the constant anger and shouting isn't going to make his case.  Frankly, he acts like a typical know-it-all 15 year old. What happened the to sweet Harry we used to know and love?  Now he thinks he knows better than anyone else, no one else could POSSIBLY know how he feels, and, as usual, he totally ignores the sensible things he could do, like talk to Dumbledore about his problems, in favor of acting like a hero.  If he didn't want the constant attention, there are avenues he could take.  He's made the same mistakes time and again, he should learn from them.  Tell other people when something's wrong!<br />The beginning drags a bit.  This probably could have been shortened by about a hundred pages if things had been condensed.<br />One-dimensional characters: Draco can't be ALL bad, yet he's shown as constantly evil, no matter what.  Everyone has a good side to them.<br />The death of one of my favorite characters!<br />Other than that, it was an excellent read.  I can't wait for the next book.
