When I saw the Harry Potter movie marathon during the holidays, I thought I'd try reading the books. At first, I was skeptical because when they first came out I didn't get what the hype was all about. But now after seeing the movies and reading the complete series, I understand it now.<br /><br />This book is truly captivating, more intense and frightening than the first. I absolutely loved it! It was both entertaining and funny, much like the other six in the series. It is engaging to read, and I honestly think it appeals to all ages. Even older readers will enjoy being taken back to the days when the border between fantasy and reality was blurred, and all the books would keep the modern teenager entranced. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets actually kept me laughing throughout. At some points in the middle, the story may get slightly boring, but don't worry, it gets better. This series blurs the ordinary design of which children's books are written. But most are not always written with the same stylish elegance J.K. Rowling seems to successfully integrate into the plot, and they each carry their own sense of magic, to the point in which the reader can't seem to put the book down! This book is a must read, it is one of my favorites! I would highly recommend the Harry Potter book series!&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets-Special-Edition/dp/0747545774/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Special Edition)</a>
