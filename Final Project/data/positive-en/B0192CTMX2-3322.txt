I was seriously excited about the last and final chapter of the Harry Potter Saga. When I recieved the book, I dove right in and didn't stop until I had finished. At the end of the book, I had a sense of completion and closure, but also a small sense of disappointment.<br /><br />There seems to be one thing about the story that made me sad. I see that J.K. made the story line end in the way that we would expect. I didn't want to expect the ending, but I did. This made me slightly disappointed.<br /><br />Also, her writing isn't the best I have ever seen. The reason that the book and the characters and the story are so good is because of the underlying theme and the strength of character.<br /><br />Although there were some things I didn't like, overall I still loved the entire series and I will probably read them all one more time.<br /><br />I recommend it for everyone.
