Loved reading this book.  With three kids, aged 12, 10 and 7, the two older kids have read through all the books - sans pictures.  In our house, we have a rule that you cannot watch the movie before having read the book.  The older two are so obsessed with Harry Potter, they talk about it all the time.  They walk around the house humming the music and have constructed most of Diagon Alley out of Legos - no instructions.  The 7-year old has been mostly left out of it all because to ask her to sit down with a beefy chapter book with little to no illustrations is a stretch.<br /><br />I saw this book at the Universal Studios Harry Potter store.  At first I didn't understand why there would be a different version.  I wondered if it was an exact copy of the chapter book or somehow modified.  Then it dawned on me.  It's a genius idea.  By having many illustrations, it helps to pull younger readers such as my daughter into the fold.  It softens the fact that we're sitting and reading a 300 page chapter book together if she can occasionally look at a picture.  Genius!<br /><br />Rather than pay full price for the book at Universal Studios, I ran home and ordered it from Amazon.  We read it in a week and a half and she was completely enraptured.  Had no issues with attention span whatsoever.  Truth be told, I read it to her, but was happy to do so.  I'm hoping that in subsequent books, she'll be able to trade off with me reading a page here and there. Today, we watched the movie together and upon the credits rolling at the end, she said to me &#34;Mom, can we start book two?&#34;  Cha-ching!<br /><br />It's a beautifully illustrated book.  I love that the illustrator didn't just copy the images of the actors in the movie.  It's beautifully done and feels so substantial.  I also love, love, loved the built-in bookmark.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
