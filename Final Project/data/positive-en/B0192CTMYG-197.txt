Okay, everyone already knows about Harry Potter, the entire universe has seen the movies and most of the known world has read the books. I bought this because my first copy had broken apart, and I have to admit it had been read a LOT. I splurged and bought the British version because I'm an anglophile and I find it silly to have the English translated into American. Like I don't know what a scone is, for Pete's sake?! Hagrid sounds so much more himself in the rude slang that Ms. Rowling (G*d bless her) gives him, and all those extra u's just make the words a little rounder and fuller in the mouth (or mind). If you have not read the Harry Potter books, then you have missed a great treat. And as for those unread people who think this is anti-Christian, I find her philosophy fits beautifully into Christian thought, and in fact the culminating book of the series IS Christian and nothing else in the beliefs and actions of the young hero, though she is the furthest thing from &#34;religious&#34; and preachy. Think C.S. Lewis' Narnia series for older kids. And adults.  If you want anti-Christian, then Pullman is your man.
