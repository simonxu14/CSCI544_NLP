When I first heard about this, I got really excited and then calmed myself down as to not be disappointed.<br />Fast forward to about two weeks ago (having forgotten about this edition) I find a post about it on Facebook, you can imagine my delight as I ordered it and saw the delivery date. I received it today and this this is big and heavy. It almost could pass for a coffee table book. The outer sleeve is beautifully illustrated with shiny gold lettering. The pages themselves are a nice glossy feeling and almost every one has an illustration of some sort, lots of these being simple ink blots or similar. The illustrations are huge, many taking an entire page, lots more taking half. As an avid Harry Potter fan I recommend this 100%. It's like reading the book for the very first time, the illustrations really bring it to life.<br /><br />Tl;dr<br />This illustrated edition is fantastic<br />Worth every penny<br />Order it now for you or the Harry Potter lover in your life<br /><br />10/10<br />Will be buying all of them as they become available.<br />Bravo Jim Kay, bravo!
