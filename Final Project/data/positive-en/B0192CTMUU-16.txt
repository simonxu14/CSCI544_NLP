I'm a grandmother and great-grandmother and thought it about  time (past time, actually) to read the rest of the Harry Potter books which I had started with my children. Starting from the first book again I have to say that each has been an entertaining pleasure. Nothing in the world can compete with a wonderful imagination and with each book I have been delighted with the gifts of J. K. Rowling.  Thank you for the adventure and excitement.
