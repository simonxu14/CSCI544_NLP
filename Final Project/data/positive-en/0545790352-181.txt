My god, this is beautiful. I knew it was going to be great but I honestly almost had the sensation of holding a new Harry Potter book in my hands. I sat down and read the first few pages and it was an insanely different, yet nostalgic, experience from when I originally read the first book as an 8 year old.  The illustrations are beautifully drawn and well placed. There are just enough drawings, not too few, not one every page. The book itself is fairly large but it's much nicer to see Jim Kay's illustrations that way. I will 100% be collecting all 7 of these  as the release, and while I will definitely read through each one, I am most excited to one day share them with my children.
