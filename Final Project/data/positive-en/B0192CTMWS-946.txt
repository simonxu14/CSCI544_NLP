A lot can be said for this book, but the first thing that came to mind was, "she really did it. It is over." What she actually did will not be revealed here, even if others are posting it everywhere. this is not a spoiler. Suffice it to say that she made it clear that there will be no more books about the teenage angst filled wizard Harry Potter.<br />The book was not as engrossing as the first couple. The first couple I went sleepless nights to finish. I did not do that with this one. I am not sure if that had anything to do with the story telling, or was more just a factor of the daunting appearance of 700+ pages sitting before me.<br />This was one of the most consistently good series I have ever read.<br />Enjoy it!
