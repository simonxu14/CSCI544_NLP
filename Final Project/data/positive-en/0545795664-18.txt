I wanted to get deeper into Pok&eacute;mon, and catch up on what I missed out when I was younger. This book is definitely perfect for anybody wanting to have a broader knowledge about the many, MANY, Pok&eacute;mon out there. Also very useful to have if you're playing Pok&eacute;mon GO. Graphics are good, gives pretty in depth detail, and is perfect for a quick read. Definitely recommend.
