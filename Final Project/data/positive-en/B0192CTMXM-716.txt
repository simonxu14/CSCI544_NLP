This is the highly anticipated 5th ook in the Harry Potter series. It is also the best, by my opinion.<br />  This book portrays Harry as a 15-year-old adolesent, showing us his crushes on Ravenclaw seeker Cho Chang, his determination, and most of all, his anger. In this book, perhaps the darkest book in the entire series, he is angry for all the bad hands he's been dealt over the years, lashing out at almost everyone and letting his anger out on them. Ron and Hermione don't change much, personality-wise, but their role in the story becomes consideringly more important.<br />  I, for one, was very eager to learn what Dumbledore "should have told him five years ago" and was amazed at how well J.K. Rowling had explained all the strange happenings and adventures  that had occured during the previous Harry Potter books. The whole book is extremely well done and emotional. One of the main characters dies very dramatically.<br />  Like I said, it's the best Harry Potter book so far, also the most vibrant, visual, exciting, dramatic, humorous, and just about any other descriptive word one would give to a five-star book. Harry Potter fans won't be dissapointed.
