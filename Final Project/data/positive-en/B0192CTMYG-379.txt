My seven year old daughter and I are thoroughly enjoying this book. I have read the book through because I couldn't wait to see what happens myself. It is a fun, heartwarming book that is so imaginative I smile when I think  of it. We can't wait to read the sequels. What a pleasant way to put my  daughter to bed each night. Thank you Ms. Rowling! Imagination and  Creativity and Excitement  begin to describe this great book. I'd say the  age levels should be 7 on up!
