I read this book aloud with my husband and we were riveted to the end.  We could hardly put it down.  There were several nights that we stayed up all night reading it.  It is that good.  I won't spoil it for you in case you haven't read it, but there is a whole chapter devoted to whether Snape is a bad guy or a good guy, you get to see Bill and Fleur's wedding, you find out who R.A.B. is and just about every question from the series is wrapped up.  A wonderful end to a wonderful series and we will all miss waiting for new books to come out.  If you haven't bought yourself a copy yet, what are you waiting for?  Don't you want to find out if Harry lives or not and whether or not he manages to defeat Voldemort?  Go ahead and buy your copy today.  It's great!
