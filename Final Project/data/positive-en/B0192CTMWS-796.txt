What seems most wonderful about the conclusion of this series is the interconnectedness of generations of families both past and future that gives a rich depth to the values that are in conflict. The story becomes timeless. We are just enjoying this generation as they experience the conflict. There is a sense that the lessons learned are something each generation must pass on to the next.<br />This series also continues to develop characters so that we really feel attracted to some and repeled by others -- or sympathetic at least.<br />This is something movies can only give a glimpse of so reading the books remains a must do before thinking the movies will do the story justice. The movies made of these will continue to be a series of snap shots reminding us of the books and helping enrich our imaginations.<br />Several of my pet theories play out in the end but there are several things that remains loose or lost.<br />I would love to know what happened to Crookshanks. I thought there was more for the cat to do.
