I am a librarian at an elementary school. Not only do I highly recommend this book, but even I could not put it down!!! It is very imaginative, intelligent and funny! The female characters tend to be a bit  stereotypical, but this book has so many other outstanding qualities that  it rates at least 5 stars! I can't wait for the next one!!!!!
