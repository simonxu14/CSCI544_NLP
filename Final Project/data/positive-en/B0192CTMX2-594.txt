J.K. Rowling is a genius. She creates a magical world that enchants both adults and children. This book is just as wonderful as her others in the series. I am so sad that I will not read about Harry and his friends' adventures after this book. I think that she left the possibility open but she claims in her interviews that this is the last one.<br /><br />In this book, we are taking a ride through the darker side of magical life. No character is what they seem. We learn new things about characters that we never suspected. It was surprising that she used every character from her books.<br /><br />This is the showdown between Voldemort and Harry. One of them must die but who? How can one teenage boy defeat an older more powerful wizard? Voldermort has the Death Eaters and the dementors. Every political office is run by one of the Death Eaters. Harry has his immediate friends and the Order but this is it.<br /><br />The last 50 pages were so intense. These pages were the heart and conclusion of the book. We learn things along the way such as Ron and Hermione's affection for one another and how much Harry loves Ginny. Harry is forced to face real fears for the first time. He knows that he might die and he is trying to deal with that fact. He is also angry and upset over the loss of Dumbledore and other friends and family members. Suddenly, he does not seem so big and powerful. He learns things about his parents that he never knew and he finds out somethings about himself too.<br /><br />Enjoy and then start with book one again to live the adventures all over again!
