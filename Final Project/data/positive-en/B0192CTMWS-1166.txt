With how popular this book was, I had to "rush" reading it so I wouldnt hit spoilers.. I read one and was very upset, and then someone "told" me another one after I said I didn't want to hear spoilers.. so after the first read I said "it was good but I didnt like X, Y and Z". Second time I read it it was WAY better I think because I enjoyed it more, took in more and didn't "miss" as much from rushing. It was great!
