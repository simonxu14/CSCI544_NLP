This is the book that started it all!  By now you've seen the film.  I finally got around to reading this cleverly packaged fast paced fantasy.  The next time you see Owls flitting about you,  stop and listen.  Perhaps you are being summoned to the next meeting of the Hogwarts.  The book approaches familiar themes of injustice to  fragile, vulnerable children by transforming them into  gifted beings.  A little "divine intervention" keeps the action sparkling, crisp and "rights" a lot of "wrongs".If you liked both this book and the film, make sure you see "SHREK".  It is another action filled fantasy.
