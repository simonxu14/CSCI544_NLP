As a big Harry Potter fan, I really appreciate how beautifully the story of Book 1 was illustrated. It's very detailed and full of color; it also gives a new experience when re-reading it again.<br />I love how all Potterheads thought of the same details so differently, but still so close to the esence of the story, and this book is the proof of that..<br />I definitely recommend this book, especially if you are a Harry Potter book collector.
