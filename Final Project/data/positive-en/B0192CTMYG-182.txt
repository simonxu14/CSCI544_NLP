Jk Rowling is amazing , I am a life long reader ,biographys, history, politics,clasics, mystery's ,ect ect .One of rhe great joys of my life was reading to my children , I started reading this to them aloud, and I was hooked ,so were they !!!! We continued on with the series, standing in line at ,midnight for the next book !!!!! In August !!!!  ANYONE who can get children to want to read a book so much during summer vacation deserves a medal !!!! What a wonderful time we had !!! I must admit by the time the last one came out,my kids were in college, that did not stop me from standing in line at the bookstore at midnight for my copy, I was pleased to see I was not the only one with white hair !! But it filled me with joy to see all the age groups there waiting for a BOOK and talking about the last one ,speculating about the new release !! THANK YOU JK ROWLING for your wonderful world of Harry Potter !!!
