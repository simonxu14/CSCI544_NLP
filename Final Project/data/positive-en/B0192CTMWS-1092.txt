My family has enjoyed listening to the Harry Potter audio books for several years.  Jim Dale's readings include a host of characters with remarkably distinctive voices that carry over from the first book, the Sorcerer's Stone, to the last.  He reads with fabulous energy and makes these great stories come to life like nothing I've ever heard before.<br />The Prisoner of Azkaban is no exception.  This audiobook is a fabulous way to enjoy several afternoon in the car or in your favorite chair at home.
