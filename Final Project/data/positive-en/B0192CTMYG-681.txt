Love it.  I don't have a chance to read much about the children books.  However, I found this book is highly imaginative.  Eventhough, some parts are violence concerning this is a book for 9-12 years old kids.  But look  to the bright side, this book contained every children dream.  Imagine  this! the lonely boy who never seen his parent, never know who he is, live  with the relative who hate him for the reason that he never know for 10  suffering years.  Then one day, he found out that he is a wizard and a  famous one too.  Lot of fantasy, I must said.  But who would not love  fantasy story.  If you are an adult, please...please read it with a child  heart because this book is for everyone who still young at heart.
