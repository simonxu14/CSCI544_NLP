As the finale of the HP series The Deathly Hallows is a must read.  It is the final evolution of both the HP series and the ideas and writing of Rowlings (at least within the series).  The book finally ties together the unresolved but suspected issues and tensions between Harry and Severus Snape and ends the feud between Harry and Voldemort.<br />Reading this on an Android phone was somewhat less satisfying than turning the pages of a real book but it is far more portable and available to a busy scheduled person.
