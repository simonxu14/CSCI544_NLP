I just recently finished a second reading of "The Order of the Phoenix."  And I must say that everything Rowling said would happen, is a big down-play to what actually happens.  The normal array of twists and turns in the plot kept me reading the thing straight through, at 870 pgs. this took awhile.  I was amazed at the revelations Rowling reveals.  I wasn't expecting to find out about many of the things till her last book.<br />This book has grown-up with Harry.  Rowling doesn't play the kids as little sweet boys and girls, but gives them raw teenage emotions.  Plus you get to meet all your old friends.  Almost everyone from the previous books comes back into this one, even Lockhart in a small, but amusing, role.<br />This books has many joyous times but also has its sad.  Like Rowling has said someone dies.  She wasn't kidding.  Many people will be upset to see this character gone.  But their death brings up many questions in Harry, that add to the wonderful book this is.  I recommend that anyone and everyone read it.  Though you don't have to read the other books before you read this one, I think you should.  Happy Reading.
