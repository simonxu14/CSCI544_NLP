Of course it's a great book and I wanted another copy so I wouldn't have to read my first edition, since I decided to re-read the books and this one was no longer available in our public library (all of the copies had been stolen).  This copy is very clean, nice, and arrived quickly.  The shipper / seller is highly recommended.
