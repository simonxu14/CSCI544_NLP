I never read the Harry Potter books before, we had only seen the movies and were curious to see how they line up with each other. While the movies are almost exactly like the book- the books give you extra depth that makes the movies all the better! So even if you know the story from seeing the movies, you will really love reading the book and then noticing all of the subtleties that are addressed in the book and then just casually happen in the movie. I really recommend it! We read the book and then when we got about half way in we watched the movie too! GREAT book- we ended up buying the whole set of them hardback a few weeks later!
