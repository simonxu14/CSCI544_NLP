Pre-ordered this book - once I heard about it through a friend, I had to have it, plus it released the day before my birthday! When it finally arrived, I didn't realize that it was going to be the actual Sorcerer's Stone book - I love it even more for that! I cannot wait to start reading it, I browsed through most of the artwork already, its all beautiful. A must for any Harry Potter lover! :)<br />Only downside about my order is how long the shipping took - if I would have known it was going to take as long as it did to get to my house, I would have just bought it from the bookstore; it would have saved me from paying for the shipping. The tracking was inaccurate and was the longest shipping experience I've had with Amazon. Because I'm an avid Harry Potter fan and the book itself is so great is the only reason I'm giving this 5 stars!
