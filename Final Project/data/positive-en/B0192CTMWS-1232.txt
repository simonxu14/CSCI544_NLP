Jim Dale has delivered the final Harry Potter book with his usual superb delivery and has not left me disappointed.  Although I read the book first, hearing it on the audio version has brought it to life in a whole other light.  He is consistent with voices and inflections, and has been since book one.  I highly recommend both the book itself and the audio version.
