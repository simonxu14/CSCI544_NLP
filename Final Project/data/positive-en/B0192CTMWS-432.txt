This has become my favorite book in the series.  I definitely enjoyed reading it from cover to cover and I'm looking forward to read it again.  I think to keep so many people interested for a series of 7 books is nothing short of miraculous. I'm a little bit saddened that there will be no more Harry Potter books to look forward to, but all good things must come to an end.
