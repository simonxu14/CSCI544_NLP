The Carol of Harry's Heart<br /><br />The is the best book so far and every time you think you have JK Rowling figured out, she throws you off into another dimension.  I have already read the sixth book, however this one and Chamber of Secrets are my favorites. There are so many rich, convoluted themes running behind one another and beside one another. The despair in Harry's belief that Sirius will return as a ghost brought tears to my eyes. How one woman can carry within herself the feelings so many of us have and write them in such a way so those feelings become almost of a physical nature. As if you could touch them with your hands.<br /><br />And at 12 midnight tonight, we will all discover what happens to Harry and the friends he cherishes so much. So this is what I think may happen:<br /><br />In book four, there is a gleam of triumph in Dumbledore's eyes. As awful as this is that Voldermort shares the same blood of Harry which includes the blood of Harry's mother, it makes Voldermort "more human" for Harry to destroy.<br /><br />In book five, Dumbledore tells Harry it is love which is Harry's greatest power. Dumbledore tells Tom (Voldermort) his greatest weakness is that he does not believe there are things worse than death.<br /><br />Harry's love will destroy, not kill Voldermort, and Voldermort will become horribly maimed and crippled. Harry will take great pity on him and this act will cause a magic which will transform Voldermort into a green Phoenix. The same color of Harry's eyes.<br /><br />In book five, two of the broken prophesies state; "At the solstice will come a new . . ."and none will come after."  Does this mean a new dawn of good triumphing over evil?<br /><br />And there is the debt owed to Harry from Peter Pettigrew. Peter will find a horcrux for Harry to destroy or he will help defend Harry.<br /><br />Longbottom and Lovegood will end up together and that there will be three houses left instead of four.<br /><br />Snape is the most difficult to predict because you have to remember that it was he who caused the death of the woman he loved. Each time he looks at Harry, he sees the man he loathed and the woman he loved. In a way, he is a tortured soul with no one to turn to.<br /><br />A splendid, splendid marvel of literature and one that stands up in its own right.
