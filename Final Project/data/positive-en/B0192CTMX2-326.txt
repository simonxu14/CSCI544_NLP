I just want to say thank you to Jim Dale for his work on all the HP books. It is like a merging of the literary and the live-action done splendidly! As if you are hearing a play acted out. He gives such distinction to all the characters, you don't have to think twice about which character's voice you are hearing at any given moment. My favorite being his perfect rendition of the sultry sexy voice of Severus Snape. Through Jim Dale's readings I believe you can gain valuable insight to the mysteries yet to be solved within JKR's story. I doubt I would have formed some of the theories I have on the evolution of certain characters without hearing Jim's voice. Even if you already own the hardcover edition of this or any of the other 4 HP books I highly recommend picking up the audio books as well!
