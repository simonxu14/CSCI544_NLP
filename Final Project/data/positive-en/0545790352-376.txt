With these pictures my grandson doesn't want me to stop reading! He is willing to sit close and not run off to play in case he misses something. The pictures help him to better visualize the story which is important with young children. I read the books to his mom, but he couldn't get into the story until these pictures helped him to understand what he was hearing.<br /><br />When I showed it to my daughter, she grabbed it and ooh'd and aah'd and said that she wished for an entire set!<br /><br />Older kids will enjoy reading to themselves more with these lovely drawings showcasing a dramatic scene. Okay, I'm going through withdrawal myself and can't wait for our next reading session.
