What more can be said about Harry Potter? At this point you either have fallen in love with the series, you've found it's not for you, or, by now, you're likely not ever going to bother with it. So all I can and should add to the discussion is about this release. I was leery of how this edition would come out when I first heard about this edition. I feared that all we'd get was a few drawings dispersed meagerly throughout and that none would really sum up any iconic scenes in a meaningful way. Fortunately I was wrong. The entire book is packed with full color illustrations that, rather than depict scenes specifically, adds a new layer to the experience of reading these books. Definitely worth picking up, even if you've read every book to death and own every other edition, this is one that any Potter fan must have.<br /><br />My only complaint? The book is physically large. It's not easy to just sit down and read. If you want to settle in and get comfy while reading Harry Potter this one isn't for that. It's more of a sit at a desk or table and read type book.
