I was surprised by the length of the book, but found it absolutely riveting throughout. The author has made it incredibly easy to laugh and cry along with the characters she's created. I found parts of it bringing  back embarassing memories of high school.  Quite a bit of the book made me  think, and it's a real treat to see the best traits and worst foibles of  humanity so delightfully packaged in a form that both kids and adults can  consume, without leaving anything further to be desired (except for the  sequels! ) despite the age range. I'm really excited about the next book!
