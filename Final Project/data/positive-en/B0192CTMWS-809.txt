I read this book as fast as I could, and despite it's length, I was finished by early afternoon the day after it came out.  As will all of the Harry Potter books, I didn't want it to end, and I can't wait for the next installment.<br />This is definatly the darkest of the Harry Potter books, and is showing a new level of writing maturity for the author.  The readers are growing up as Harry does, and Rowling has been able to accuratly judge what her readers can and can't handle, and while she may come close to the line, I do not think she has stepped over it.  I encourage the parents of younger readers, probably ages 12 and younger, to read the book with their children and help them with any of the parts that might be beyond their understanding or experiance, but I see no reason why anyone else would have any problems with the difficulty level of the book.<br />This is a terrific and engrossing read, and I congratulate author J.K. Rowling on her latest triumph.
