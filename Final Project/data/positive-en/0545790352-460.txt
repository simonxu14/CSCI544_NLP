So Beautiful, I grew up reading and loving these books, and now I'm at the age where I'm starting to think about having my own kids, so when this came out, and I saw the pictures from others who have ordered it before, I purchased it right away, because these illustrations add so much to the story, and I want my kids to grow up with imagination and wonder, and these images help create it and enhance the magical experience of the wizarding world...  Jo, I don't know if you read these reviews, but please consider doing illustrated versions of all the books.  I know the seventh will probably end up being 12&#34; thick, but I will still find a place for it on my bookshelf ;)
