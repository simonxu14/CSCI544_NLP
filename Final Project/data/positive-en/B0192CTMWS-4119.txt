The Harry Potter books have all been winners.  They grab you from the first page and it's hard to put the book down until you are finished -- then you want more.  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the best of the lot.  Just what I have come to expect from J. K. Rowling.  The excitement builds throughout the book.  And the end is appropriate.
