Lived up to the hype - couldn't put it down. An amazing end that leaves the reader slightly out of breath, but completely satisfied. Glad to hear that she'll be publishing the back stories in an "encyclopedia" format, as some of the characters were left a little more open ended than others.<br />Agreed with the reviews about some of the action/fight scene writing - confusing at times. Also, some of the magic logic used to justify the actions towards the end were oddly communicated. Overall, though - I couldn't imagine being more impressed.
