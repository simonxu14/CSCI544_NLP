Although I had to wait a bit for my book, it did arrive within the allowed time and in perfect condition even though it was a used book.  I have ordered quite a few books from Amazon and have always been satisfied with the results.<br />The only sad part is that this was the final book of what I feel is a great series.  Fun for all ages.
