This is by far the darkest in tone of the Potterverse books. We have Harry as the Angry Young Man with abandonment issues (this gives nothing of the plot away and is not a spoiler, and it's evident from page one).<br /><br />Someone has it in for Harry Potter, and it's not just the Dark Lord. It seems that the Ministry of Magic has a minor issue with Mr. Potter. Asdie from Ron, Hermione and the people (except for the Dursleys) who know him, there's an issue of just how blind politicians can be.
