Another fantastic year at Hogwarts with the usual schoolboy antics of our wizard in training hero and his classmates. This year they have classes in magical animals, so, we get to meet the likes of Buckbeak, the hippogrif.  Then, there is the mysterious sickly new instructor of Defenses Against the  Black Arts, who teaches about boggarts and the like. Loved the game of  quidditch and the description of the sweet shop in Hogsmeade. Can't wait to  do this as a read aloud to my students. Thanks Ms. Rowling.
