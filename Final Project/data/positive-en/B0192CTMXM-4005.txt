This book was purchased for my son back when he was almost 12.  Here's what he had to say about it at that time:  "This is the best book in the world, although 6 and 7 are bound to be beter. I am a total fan of harry potter and even recomend this to minor fans. I have all of the best series in the world... !HARRY POTTER!"
