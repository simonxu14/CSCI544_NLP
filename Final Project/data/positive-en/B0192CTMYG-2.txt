I studied Spanish in high school and university.  I am far from a fluent speaker, though I don't think I'd get myself killed wandering around in Mexico or Spain.  Having read all of the Harry Potter books in English many times, I decided to give this a try to brush up on my Spanish skills.  I am only about 50 pages into it (reading Spanish takes me a lot longer than English!) but so far I am enjoying it immensely.  Of course, it helps that I know what is happening, but that has also helped me with my understanding of the Spanish.  I've really enjoyed this experience.
