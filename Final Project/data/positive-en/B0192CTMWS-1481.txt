For the most part, I really enjoyed reading this book.  It certainly has its minor flaws and inconsistencies, but over-analysis of any multiple-book series this complex will always yield them.  Other reviewers have mentioned my two main dislikes about this book:<br /><br />1) The middle drags quite a bit.  It seems like with so much to resolve, the entire book could be used to reveal secrets and plot details.  Instead, we are treated to (what seems like) many chapters of "Harry doesn't know what to do or look for next."  After a while I started thinking, "OK, we get it, Harry and team are stuck on their quest!"<br /><br />2) The epilogue is weak and unsatisfying.  I think most Harry Potter readers could've written that epilogue themselves.  No epilogue at all would've left most readers guessing that what happened to the characters is precisely what Rowling wrote.<br /><br />Still, the end was pretty satisfying and well-conceived.  While there were moments where I feared the whole thing would degenerate into a giant Star Wars or Lord of the Rings battle, I was glad to see the story stay a little more thoughtful than that.
