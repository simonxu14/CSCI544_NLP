Wow.<br />This weekend my 11-year-old son, my wife, and I all read the new Harry Potter book.  How is this possible for a 734-page book?  We made some ground rules and stuck to them (you can't take the book away from someone  until they've finished a chapter, you can't keep the book from someone if  you're not reading it yourself, no spoilers, no taking the book out of the  house).<br />The short review:  this is the best one yet.  Rowling's  imagination is inexhaustible, the characters grow and change in unexpected  but absolutely right ways, and the struggle between good and evil is more  gripping than ever.<br />Although I'll post a longer review later, I'll get to  the most important point now.  The only plausible reason I have ever seen  for not buying the Harry Potter books is a worry by some Christians that  the emphasis on magic and witchcraft is somehow unhealthy.<br />All I can  say is that those books are spiritually in the right place -- it is VERY  clear what the difference is between good and evil and which side we should  be fighting on, even at the cost of great pain, sacrifice, and death.<br />The latest book is the best yet in this respect -- the villains are much  more openly evil, and yet the reader understands why they choose that path  [hint: power and pride], while learning both the ultimate soul-destroying  horror of it and the necessity of fighting it at ALL times (every choice  you ever make being potentially decisive).
