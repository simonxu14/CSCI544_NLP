This is the best book yet in the series. It is exciting on every page. Rowling is an extremely talented storyteller with an incredible imagination.  I finished the Goblet of Fire and was disappointed because  now I have to wait for the sequel. Rowling ties up lots of loose end, only  to create so many questions for the next one. I fully expect number 5 to be  the most exciting HP book when it comes out. What I love most is that my  students who hate to read or avoid reading are reading this book and loving  it.  Highly recommend, almost any age.
