If you liked the first three books, you'll like this one. There's even more to enjoy here, 734 pages' worth! Old characters return: the Weasleys,  Albus Dumbledore, Hermione, Hagrid, the dreadful Dursleys, Draco Malfoy, et  al. And you'll meet new ones, such as Rita Skeeter, Mad-Eye Moody, Winky  the house-elf and Victor Krum. This is very good fantasy, the sort that  makes you see the magic in everyday life. I've noticed that more and more  grown-ups are reading this series, which is definitely not for children  only. While you're waiting for Harry Potter 5, you might enjoy reading  fantasies by two outstanding British authors, Diana Wynne Jones and Eva  Ibbotson (look for the latter's ghost books in U.K. editions).
