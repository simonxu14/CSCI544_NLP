I have been a reader of Harry Potter since I was in Junior High and now that I have followed Harry on his journey to the very end I still find myself rereading this book series every now and then.<br /><br />The storytelling By JK Rowling is excellent for any reader seeking fun filled adventure By Harry and his schoolmates.<br /><br />I have had most of these books in paperback and some of them in hardcover over the years and I find that books do wear and tear.<br /><br />I have slowly started recollecting these books again but now all of then will be in hardcover instead of paperback.<br /><br />I do hope someday I can read this to my children as a bedtime story and see the happiness that comes from them while listening to the story.<br /><br />Any child or adult will love Harry Potter And The Sorcerers Stone!!
