Amazing book, minor issue! (Really 4 1/2 stars)<br /><br />The beautiful illustrations make reading Harry Potter to my children fun, and engaging!  The book is well made and is a great gem for any book collection...<br />My only issue was that the book covers were a tiny bit warped...and compared to my Volume one I could notice a little issue.<br />But I truly enjoy the book and wouldn't regret purchasing another!<br />(I even ordered one for my brother!)
