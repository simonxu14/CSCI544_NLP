The book was outstanding... I couldn't put it down from the time I started reading it.  How Harry evolves and matures is so true to real life.  I don't want to give anything away, but there were a couple of things that were predictable.... but the rest more than made up for that.  If you're a Harry Potter fan it's a must.  The reviews about the book are right on... it's a little darker than the other stories.  I think it's really setting the stage for the last two books.  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix has alot of action, probably more than any of the others.  I hope you enjoy the book as much as I did.
