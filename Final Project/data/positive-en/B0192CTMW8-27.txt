My 8 1/2 year old son and I are reading the Harry Potter books together.  I am enjoying the story as much as he is, maybe more!  We read the first book, then watched the movie, and now we are doing the same with this book, and plan on continuing with the entire series.  HIGHLY recommend for all ages!
