A nice end to a great series. A few spoilerish observations:<br /><br />1. Under the most intense scutiny imaginable, J.K. Rowling has the guts to finish what she started by providing an actual ending. There are no what-do-you-think-happened-to-Harry? moments, no it's-up-to-you-to-decide-whether-Snape-was-loyal-to-Dumbledore cop-outs. Non-endings are neither original nor clever. Tony Soprano, I'm looking at you.<br /><br />2. The massive cross-references to past events and people demonstrate the care that went into this book (Ravenclaw's diadem - how cool!), but this time around it was a little too much of a good thing. The past locations and people were great, but by the time Oliver Wood showed up the gratuitous cameos were well out of hand and I was reminded of the Seinfeld finale.<br /><br />3. You know what's really great about Rowling? She can explain without overexplaining. The connection between the Muggle and Wizarding worlds is explained adequately without a legal brief answering all the what-if's, and there's not a midichlorian in sight.<br /><br />4. I am such a sucker for a good seige; all that was missing was a Henry V speech from Minerva. Rowling is so great at knowing where to set her scenes. The ending could only be at Hogwarts.<br /><br />5. Can't say I liked the mechanics of how Snape was handled. I think his history with Harry called for more face-to-face time in this book, and there was something just too passive about Harry hiding behind a crate while Snape has his final moments with Voldemort. Also, Snape's backstory was good, but telling it in a chapter-long flashback was awkward. That being said, what a wonderful author's touch for Snape to ask Harry to look at him as he dies, so that the last thing Snape sees are Harry's (Lily's) eyes.<br /><br />6. In some places, the book seemed to have the feel of a screenplay, with scenes constructed based on how they would appear on a movie screen. Maybe this is just my own hangover from having recently seen Order of the Phoenix.<br /><br />7. I've always admired Rowling for earning the right (after her first book) to have her books published in the U.S. with the orignal U.K. language intact. However, this was the first time I found it a little distracting; did the other books have so many "had done"'s in them? Still, her style is like a direct download into your head, clean and efficient. The great ones make it look easy.<br /><br />Man, I'm really going to miss these books.
