Jim Dale's "reading" on the CD version of Phoenix turns this thick book into a virtuoso piece of one-man theater (would that he would tackle War and Peace or Moby Dick). Dale brings an experienced stage-actor's pacing, emotional inflections and, most incredibly, various vocal characterizations and (British) accents for dozens upon dozens of different characters. Even the most gifted "amateur" reader would be hard put to match this prodigious effort. The climactic fight near the end of the book, if anything, is easier to follow and far more exciting with Dale's pacing and delivery that a mere reading of the printed pages.<br /><br />Encouraged by this success I also listened to Dale's performance of the next installment (#6, Half Blood Prince) where his acting gifts make Harry's faults more vivid than the printed version (Potter is, by now in Dale's interpretation, definitely not your unblemished do-gooder) and intensify to an almost unbearable degree the final chapters of the book. In the cave scene especially, Dale's performance brings out, to a disturbing extent, the agony and sadism inherent in the plot.<br /><br />All these discs, transferred to a iPod or other personal player, will make for many delighted hours in the presence of a voice-acting master.
