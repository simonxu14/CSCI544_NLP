This is the best edition of Potter EVER produced. .  . . pictures are GREAT but this edition is approx 11 x 10. .. .and a great source to be able to read to your younger HP fans and pictures to show them what the word are saying.  I collect books, and have all of the American editions, the UK editions and the special editions, but this is by far the best. I can not wait until CoS is released. . ..very very nice.
