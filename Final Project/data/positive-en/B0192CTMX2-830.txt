The 5th book of the Harry Potter series doesn't take long to get intresting.  The very first chapter has an unexpected attack in it by two Dementors on Harry and Dudley.  Harry fights off the two Dementors and gets exspelled from Hogwarts....or does he?<br />  Later in the book, the evil toadlike Professor Umbridge ("hem,hem")  has Harry in Detention with a quill that requires no ink.  Everybody (or mostly everybody) doesn't believe Harry or Dumbledore that Lord Voldemort has come back.  Professor Umbridge is made High Inquistor of Hogwarts and later she replaces Albus Dumbledore as the headmistress of Hogwarts.  After Professor Umbridge is Headmistress, the students rebel.  Fred and George soon leave Hogwarts, rather then being tortured by the caretaker.<br />  Soon Hagrid runs off like Albus Dumbledore and poor Professor McGonall gets hit by four stunning spells in the chest.  Better than the 4th book!
