Wow! It's a wonderful extension of the series of Harry Potter.  Everyone in our family is in line to read it, but Mom got to go first and I finished in 2 days.  Harry doesn't disappoint with more great stuff at Hogwarts  school and all our favorite characters back again.  This might be a little  more &quot;dark&quot; than the early ones, but I think that #3 is more so.  I loved the new wizard game in it, and having Harry and the gang grow up  just a little is very realistic. There are lots of fun magical creatures  and spells that go wrong to keep things exciting, and good does always win  out in the end.  I like Harry's resourcefulness and the way most adults who  care about him are wise and helpful, but let him figure out how to deal  with problems, too.  I would recommend that parents follow the not younger  than 9 years rating on it, but no one in my family is under 19 and we love  them all!  I can't wait for the next one.
