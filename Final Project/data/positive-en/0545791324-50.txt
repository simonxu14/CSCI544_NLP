Not going to comment on the story as I am sure Amazon has plenty reviews on Chamber of Secrets.  I will only say it is perfection.  My comments are directed at Jim Kay's amazing illustrations.  The beauty of these drawings bring to life a story that everyone loves.  I feel that Kay's illustrations enhanced the experience.  The pictures, for me, match my imagination when reading the book.  I cannot express the urgent need for every Potterhead to buy this RIGHT NOW!  You will not regret it!
