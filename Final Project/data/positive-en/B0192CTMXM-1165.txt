I was about 10 years old when the first Harry Potter book came out and it has been delightful growing up with the series. JK Rowling does a wonderful job in building suspense and weaving a wonderful tale and finale for our beloved hero and those we have come to admire along the way.<br /><br />There are a few inconsistencies within the chapters, but I don't want to give too much away and spoil the plot for others. I'll just mention one part where a main character states that he/she used a memory charm on someone, but later sincerely says they never cast it before. It is a complex tale and it is understanding that the author and editor could have overlooked such a minute portion of the text without picking up on it. I felt rather put off by the epilogue as well, along with a couple instances of crude language, a few minor curse words that I feel should have been edited out for the younger readers, regardless of the escalating tension within the storyline at those moments. While it was nice to know what happened to some of our favorite characters in the epilogue, too much time has passed for several crucial details being left out - I finished reading it and had so many questions, which makes me wonder whether Rowling did so on purpose in order to write a side story later (one can always hope!).<br /><br />I am a critical reader though, and enjoyed the ending and the enthusiasm Rowling demonstrates as she finishes telling Harry Potter's story. Buy it, read it, re-read each installment in order, see the movies and compare it to the books...future generations will enjoy it over and over. She's re-established a standard for modern writing in the fantasy genre and has joined the great works of C.S. Lewis and Tolkien. I give JK Rowling credit for stimulating the imagination of many who are overwhelmed by the easy fillers of our technological world.
