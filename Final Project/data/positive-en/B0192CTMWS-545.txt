Sometimes the last book in a series seems rushed--not quite as good as the others.  I'm glad J.K. Rowling took the time to make Deathly Hallows the best book of the Harry Potter series.  Mysteries are explained, loose ends are tied up, relationships are forged, and characters come of age.  Fans of the movies need to read the books, because they have missed so much!
