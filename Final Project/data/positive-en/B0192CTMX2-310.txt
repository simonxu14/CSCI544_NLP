I pre-ordered this book from amazon, and it was delivered on the release date as stated it would be.<br /><br />--Now for the review. I don't want to go into much detail about the book, I realize that some people may have read what they thought to have been spoilers on the book, as I actually did read a piece of a spoiler while searching "harry potter" in google. Happily, the supposedly spoiler was not correct, thus the ending was genuine.<br /><br />--Let me say that I personally think that this is the most amazing book of the entire series. The first 5 chapters of this book, are perhaps the greatest first 5 chapters out of all the books. This book is a lot different than any of the other books, and this book is more of a ending book, "seems that the whole book is the ending" I read this book in 15 hours. I would highly recommend the books over the movies, however if you have read the books and then watch the movies, your knowledge of the books fill in the skipped things in the movies. I would like to thank amazon, for getting my book shipped out on time, and I would like to thank J.K. Rowling for these most touching books, that I now hold a place in my heart for.
