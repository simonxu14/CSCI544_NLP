I purchased this book to go along with the rest of my Harry Potter collection.  I will say, the first copy I received from Amazon had damage on the dust jacket, so I returned it for a new copy.<br /><br />The book itself is amazing.  The attention to detail in the illustrations is phenomenal.  It captures the story just as you think would when you are first reading the book.  The unabridged story is in bigger font than the original book so reading it with a child would be perfect.  The pages are glossy & the book has a red ribbon to hold your place in the story.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone.  If you are a Harry Potter fan, this is a must to add to your collection.
