So incredibly beautiful. I have read the whole series more times than I can count and preordered this the minute it was available. Looking through the illustrations I find them even closer to how I imagined some things to be before the movies came out. I hope they release an illustrated version of every book. I can't wait for my daughter to be a little older so we can read them together.
