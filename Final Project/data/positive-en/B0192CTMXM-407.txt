As a huge Harry Potter fan, I find this book to be an improvement over the last two with the introduction of Professor Lupine. His relationship with Harry demonstrates the growth of Harry as he moves toward his final destiny.  The combining of the three situations, Hagrid and Buckbeek, Lupine, and Sirius Black, indicates a change in the complexity of Rowling's writing.  It was time that she gave her readers another insight into Harry's past and with that, a glimpse of his future relationships beyond Ron and Hermione.She is improving as a writer with this book.
