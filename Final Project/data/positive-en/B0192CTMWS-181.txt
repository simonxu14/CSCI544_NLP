Following the catastrophic events in the previous book, The Half-Blood Prince, Harry, Ron, and Hermoine embark on the quest that Dumbledore gave them.  They must hunt down and destroy the remaining horcruxes, the items that Voldemort placed parts of his soul into.  They know that this is the only way to defeat Voldemort for good.<br /><br />This installment is by far the most intense and suspenseful, with no relaxing until the very end.  And the final, climactic battle scene was inspiring.  I avoided spoilers and all hints about the book, so I'll avoid any details here.  But this was definitely my favorite of the seven books. Besides being so suspenseful, it was extremely emotional and epic.<br /><br />With many surprises, good and bad, I literally could not put the book down and finished it in less than a day and a half.  While I love the movie adaptations, they simply cannot compare to the depth that the books have.  I teared up at the end. And finished the book with a sigh and a smile.  Rowling has created a wonderful classic series that will continue to entertain for years to come.
