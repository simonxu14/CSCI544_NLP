Like the first two Harry Potter books this book is great,  it is in this book that parents should beware;  it starts to have a few more moments that might scare the younger reader,  it takes on a darker side as Harry ages and Voldemort begins to gain his power back,  Definately makes you want to continue to read the complete set,  this is my second time thru the books and I never tire of reading them. Great Reading for all ages
