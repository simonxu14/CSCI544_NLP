J. K. has done it again..a real page turner.  I couldn't put the book down, now must listen to the CD because there is so much more to learn each time through.<br />I hope she will write other books because she has such a fabulous style.  Her descriptions make you really see what's going on in the story, even though it is in an imaginary world.
