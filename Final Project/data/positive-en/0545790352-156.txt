I feel in love with HP as a teen-ager and find this book at the bookstore for over $40. I had to have it! I'm so gosh i checked Amazon first. I paid $23 for a book that really feels like it's worth twice that! Everything about it is well-done and beautiful. The layout, illustrations, bookmark, cover, it's all so perfect and such a great book to to your collection!
