I have followed the Harry Potter series from the very first book and have loved every word that was written.  I just finished the seventh and final book and though it was very good reading, I feel sort of empty inside like I didn't get my complete Harry Potter fix.  There are several characters that aren't mentioned in the very last chapter that it would be nice to know what happened to them.  What is Harry Potter doing?  What is George doing now that Fred is no longer there.  What about Bill and Fleur?  There are several heart wrenching scenes in this book, i.e. Mad Eye, Dobby, Lupin, Tonks and Fred.  The most moving part of the book for me was when Harry walked into the Forbidden Forest to die.  I'm sorry to see the Harry Potter series end because like I said, it just doesn't feel complete.  This is a definite read.
