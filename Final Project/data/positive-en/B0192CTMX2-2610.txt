Of course everyone knows how great these books are, but it's incredible how Rowling can keep the story so fluid and consistant throughout a nearly 900 page mega novel. I read the book to my daughter and we are both delighted and awed by the authors ability to give unique life to each individual character and her skill at transporting the reader into the magical world of Hogwarts. This book is thrilling!
