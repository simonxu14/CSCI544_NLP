While I will not reveal who dies or the main focus of the plot let me say this.  It is well worth the wait and the long read.  Rowling shows the depth of emotions within hercharacters from joy, fear, sorrow, and  treachery.  This book is the midpoint of the series and sets the stage for  the next few books well.  I am already waiting for the next book.
