I love the look of this book! The pictures look amazing and the text is big, which I like because it can be easily read. It is clear that the artist, Jim Kay put a lot of effort into creating the magical wizarding world. The only thing I didn't like is that while I was following along in this book while listening to the audiobook I realized that many of the British terms for things had been changed to American words, phrases, etc. I didn't like that at all! Why not keep it like the original? J.K. Rowling is British after all! But other than that, a beautiful accessory to a Harry Potter collection.
