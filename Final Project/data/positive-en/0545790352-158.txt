I would give this 100 stars if I could. It's so beautiful, perfect for a huge Harry Potter fan. I love the little details in the pictures, and its just so beautifully done with the cover and place-holding ribbon. The binding doesn't seem super strong (I hope it doesn't fall apart), but it is definitely worth buying!!! And 40% off of what you'd pay in a bookstore! Best Amazon purchase I've ever made.
