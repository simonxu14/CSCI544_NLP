Imagine, a wizard at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and them finding out the some of their piers are being attacked and killed. This wizard is Harry Potter and he wants to get to the bottom of these attacks.<br /> The book Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by J. K.  Rowling is set at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This setting is very believable. I felt like I was the school with Ron, Harry, and Hermione. There was a large array of description and sensory detail. That is one of the reasons I love this book.<br /> The climax and Resolution were very good and surprising. J. K. Rowling did a very good job at writing a book where one would expect an outcome but the total opposite. This was yet another one of the reason why Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is one of my favorite books.<br /> The story paced at a perfect speed. It was not too fast or too slow and left me hanging at a point where I wanted to read the 3rd book. I was able to read this book in 3 days and I was hooked to the story line.<br /> Overall, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by J. K. Rowling is a very well written book. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy, doesn't necessarily love to read, and people who read the first book of the Harry Potter series.
