I used to spend a lot of time on the road, and being a working wife and caretaker of all the pets, didn't have much time to read anymore. This is the unabridged story, and the narrator kept your interest while you listened. Arrived in good shape, and has been kept that way. And its still a story I can listen to when I don't have time to sit and watch or read.
