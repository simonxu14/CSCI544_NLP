This fourth book of the Harry Potter series was absolutely fantastic... for about the first 400 pages.  The book seemed to start dragging a bit in third quarter.  The story came to a screeching halt at one of the most  tense moments when the villain summarized the story so far as if he was in  a &quot;B&quot; movie.  Otherwise, this has everything a Potter could hope  for, and more!  It even has an ending that will make the reader crave the  fifth book!  Great job!
