With the upcoming release of Book 8, I am desperately trying to reread the first seven books before its July 31st release.<br /><br />Either it's been too long since I last read these books, or I really skimmed the other times. At my current moderate pace I'm able to really enjoy the details this go-round.<br /><br />The best thing about the Potter books are that they are truly timeless. The absence of texting or iPhones or Pokemon Go! don't seem to matter because, let's face it, the Wizards had better alternatives even back in the early 2000s. #Potterhead
