All you need to know:<br /><br />1) Different but interesting writing style.<br />2) Good character development.<br />3) Lags at first, but then picks up and I couldn't put it down.<br />4) The epilogue was MUCH too short!<br />5) There are some inside jokes for adults but the book isn't inappropriate at all.<br />6) I have to wonder HOW this will translate into a movie. So complicated, and so much (appropriate) violence.<br />7) We would have loved for the book to be 200 pages longer, but I think she presented a great finale to a much-loved series.<br /><br />P.S. Dumbledore's recent announcement isn't evident or relevant in any of the books, so parents shouldn't make that be a reason for their children to not read the books.<br /><br />-RLA
