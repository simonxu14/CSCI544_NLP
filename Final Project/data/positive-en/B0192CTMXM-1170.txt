Here it is; the final installment of Harry Potter, after years of nerd worship and Chirstian-hating, JK first series come to a close. What can I say about it without spoiling the end the end to anyone who has yet ot finish it? It ends the way we always knew it would, but J.K. expertly and loyaly adds what were always never see coming, just because thats how it always been. Simply put - loved it, and so will you.
