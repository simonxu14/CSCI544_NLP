This is perhaps about the last book I'll be able to read and sort of remember bits and pieces of the movie in my head simultaneously. The book is great from start to finish. The introduction is sort of slow with the Quidditch World Cup occupying much of the beginning of the book, though it slowly leads to the start of the fourth year at Hogwarts, and how something accidentally becomes of the goblet which was not meant to have been.
