The Order of the Phoenix is number five in the Harry Potter series. J K Rowling is amazing in that her stories seem to tell themselves, they are just waiting for your eyes and imagination to follow. The Order of the Phoenix is sure to make you forget your troubles as you fall into the magical world of Harry Potter.<br /><br />If you think you have troubles, you should read this book. Harry is experiencing angst all through this story, it is not easy being a teenager, let alone a teenager who is also a brilliant wizard. I enjoy reading about all Harry's obstacles and his struggle to win out yet again. Courage generosity and a never give up attitude make him sparkle and shine. Harry Potter stories always seem vividly fresh. The storytelling details make them breathe with reality in a fantasy world.
