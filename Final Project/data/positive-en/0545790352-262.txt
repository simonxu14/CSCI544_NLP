Almost every page in this book has an illustration of some sort or another. Sometimes the pages are completely filled with the most amazing pictures, sometimes they are made to look like they are water damaged or distressed. So much thought and work went in to making this a true work of beauty and art. I love being able to introduce a favorite story and series to my kids with pictures they love and enjoy. I cannot wait to see the rest of the books in the series in illustrated format.
