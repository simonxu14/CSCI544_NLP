I admit, I was a bit worried. With all the buildup and hype and so forth for the release of the 4th installment in the Harry Potter series I dreaded that the book wouldn't measure up, that all the excitement would be for  nothing. But the brilliant J.K. Rowling has done it again- with a book,  that, in my opinion, is the best in the series so far.  In this book,  Harry sees the Quidditch World Cup, discovers girls, is entered in a sort  of spell duel, meets some new friends and foes, becomes farther and then  closer to his friend Ron, and once again has a brush with, well,  You-Know-Who.... but I won't give it all away.  After hungrily devouring  over 700 pages of glorious fiction in about 4 hours, I was left with a grin  on my face, a feeling of triumph for Harry, and a pang that told me the  book was over; and that, alas, I would have to wait a while for the  sequel...  Thank you J.K. Rowling! What a wonderful, magical phenomenon you  have created.
