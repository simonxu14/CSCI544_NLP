HP and the Deathly Hallows is one of the greatest finishes to a book series I have ever read.  Now that I have finished the series, I have forgotten the details of many of the novels, but I can still remember the details of the Deathly Hallows.  Ron leaving Hermoine and Harry.  Harry getting captured in his pride.  The escape and the confrontation with Voldemort at Hogwarts.  Wow! I have read several series, but this finish is different.  Usually, the building material is great, but the last novel is a letdown.  This book was exciting and satisfying.  JK Rowling does not disappoint at all.  This series is great and I recommend it to everyone.
