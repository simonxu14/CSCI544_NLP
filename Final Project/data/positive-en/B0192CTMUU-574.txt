I enjoyed the book immensely but I have to agree with one of the other reviewers and say the it could have been done in a lot less pages and it was predictable. Don't get me wrong  - I'm an adult who loves Harry Potter.  I waited for this one to come out along with everyone else but I didn't get  that same feeling that I couldn't wait for the next one after finishing it.  And I can't help but think that if I were 8 years old I'd have a hard time  just lifting this book!
