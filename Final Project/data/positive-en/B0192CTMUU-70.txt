Although I really don't have to give an explanation (5 stars can explain itself), I really like where Rowling is going with the series.  It has great vocabulary - simple, yet very complex - and is great for all ages really.  Great to read at any moment (even for taking a break from finals) and kept me locked all throughout; has many meanings to understand and think about.
