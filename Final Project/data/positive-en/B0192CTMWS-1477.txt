I had stopped being a Harry Potter fan after the fifth book.  I didn't really like how the story was going at the time.  However, I did want to know how the series ended, and so I watched the movie.  I liked the movie, and this caused me to want to read the book.<br /><br />The movie was a little more appealing in that it made things have a nicer ending.  The book is a little bit more realistic.  For instance, the way Hedwig died.  In the movie, she dies defending Harry.  It is sad but sweet.  In the book, she was angry with Harry for keeping her locked in her cage.  She gets killed while riding with him when a killing spell hits her in her cage.  That is just sad.<br /><br />The book can be a little tiresome to read because it also has more interpersonal fighting between our three heroes.  However, the book does give more information.  For instance, something the movie never quite explains--how did the Deatheaters find the trio so quickly after they disappeared from the wedding.  You also learn more about who R.A.B. was and his tragic end.  This is something that is not really explained in the movie.  You learn the identity, but you don't know the reason why he did what he did.<br /><br />People who think Dumbledore was so great that he had chocolate coming out of his butt may get upset with this book, which reveals Dumbledore's imperfections and his mistakes.  To his credit, Dumbledore seemed to be someone who learned from his mistakes and tried to always do good.<br /><br />One thing I did like about this book was that we did see more of the villains in it.  One thing that has consistently annoyed me with J.K. Rowling with this series is that her bad guys always felt like an afterthought.  I really liked the Malfoys, Bellatrix Lestrange, and Voldemort...and I was disappointed that more was not done with these characters.  However, at least we have more scenes with them in this book.<br /><br />Of course, be prepared to be traumatized.  Like a Shakespearean play, a good many favorite characters get killed.
