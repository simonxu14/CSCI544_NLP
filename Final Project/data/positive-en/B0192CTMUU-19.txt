I ordered this cassette book because one of the tapes broke in my set and I needed to replace it.  I have all of the Harry Potter books on tape as well as in book.  I pop the cassette tape in, get the book open, and let the cassette read to me.  The MANY-MANY voices that Jim Dale has to portray in this entire series is simply amazing!<br /><br />All seven of the Harry Potter books are excellent. This is the fourth book in the series and things start to rock Harry's world.  The entire series is good vs evil, much like that of life.  The series tells how Harry deals with the evil that he is constantly facing and how those that love and care for him are there for Harry no matter the cost.  And Harry is always ready to fight the evil no matter the cost.<br /><br />When I began the first book, I did not care for it until I got 1/3 of the way into the book.  By the time the book ended, I had to start all over because I realized that my &#34;imagination&#34; was dead at the beginning of the book and I was ready to listen/read as I was now open to &#34;experiencing&#34; all the author had to tell me.  I was adding not only &#34;color&#34; to the story, but &#34;dimension&#34; to make it all come alive for me. The entire series would be excellent conversation with parents to their children and children to their parents.  Good for all ages!  I say that because I have no children and enjoyed the whole series.
