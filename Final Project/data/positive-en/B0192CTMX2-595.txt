Once upon a time I went to see a Harry Potter movie....the very first one.  I didn't care for it at all.  Who was this Harry Potter and why should I care about him.  The reviews of the books all said the books were better than Wizard of Oz.  How could that be?  A few years passed and Harry was more popular than ever.  In talking to a girl at work I asked her which Harry Potter book did her fan-boyfriend liked best.  She said "Goblet of Fire".  I bought it.  I read it.  I fell in love.  These stories are so charming and real.  So delightful and insightful.  Of course I read the first 3 and then bought the last 3 in hard back.  But I even wanted more.  I now have all on CDs and listen to them at work.  Jim Dale does the voices beautifully.  You can tell who is Harmione, Harry, Ron, Prof Snape, Umbridge.  Jim is a great reader and voice and you hear every word.  Unlike the movies, that are like reader's digest versions of these wonderful stories, you get it all.  And I promise you will enjoy it all.  Warning: The "Deathy Hallows" can make you cry, with joy and with sorrow.  This can be a bit awkward at work.  But life is about feelings and so are these marvelous stories.  Start with any book of the books and you will know the Harry Potter story.  But don't be put off because you don't have time or just don't like to read.  Listening can get you there too.  It's nice to be proven wrong about popular opinion.  I'm so glad I tried to see what Harry was all about.  My life is richer for it and I promise your life will be richer too.
