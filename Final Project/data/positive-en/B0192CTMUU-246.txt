This installment of the excellent series has more for adultsthan for the pre-teen audience that the series purports to target.Without giving away much of the plot, the themes of media abuse (some of the funniest scenes in the book), race relations, and class consciousness have matured the series along with the audience.  I enjoyed the book, as I have the others, and I am sure that I will not be satisfied when Harry graduates Hogwarts.  I want to see him get married, have a carreer, etc.  The more serious themes also make me want to read more from Rowling beyond Harry Potter.  Even with all of the hype, another great addition to the series.
