I've been eagerly waiting for this book since I pre-ordered it in April and I was not disappointed when I received it today. It is beautiful! I feel like there are even more illustrations than there were in the first book.<br /><br />People who are very afraid of spiders might want to be careful- there are some very detailed and creepy pictures of spiders. They don't normally bother me but there is one double paged spread of the giant spiders in the forest that creeped me out a little.<br /><br />This book has a nice Halloween vibe to it too- perfect for this time of year.
