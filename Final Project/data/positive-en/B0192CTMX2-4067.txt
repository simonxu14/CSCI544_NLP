This book had all the suspense of Mission Impossible, as Harry and his supporters are put through their paces to stay alive--let alone find and destroy the missing horcruxes set up in Half-Blood Prince, while evading capture.<br /><br />Of the many deaths and lives destroyed throughout the book, the one that carried the most poignancy was for a non-human character.  I don't want to say more, as that could be a spoiler.<br /><br />On a down note, description for some of the action in the final chapter was confusing; I had to re-read and still not sure I get it.  Also, the epilogue was equally confusing, trying to keep track of all the names thrown around with little context.  In the end, I don't think the epilogue really added anything for me.  HOWEVER--that's not to say this isn't a great book; it is.  Well-written, packed with enough stories and adventures for 2 books, strong, believable characterizations and moral complexity that adds much to the story.  After re-reading the first book a few weeks ago, it's hard to believe how skillfully Rowling pulls off the evolution of the tone, from something appropriate for a 10-year old to something as rich as DEATHLY HALLOWS.
