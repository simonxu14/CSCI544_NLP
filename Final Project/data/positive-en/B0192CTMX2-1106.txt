She's done it again. I didn't think she'd be able to outdo herself - Prizoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire were extremely well done. But here, Rowling goes and gives us the Order of the Phoenix and demonstrates just how great of an author she is. With conspiracies and secrets and plenty of psychological angst (especially for Harry), after just having finished this 800 page book after recieving it Sunday, I'm afraid I'll find myself reading it again very soon. Well done, Rowling!
