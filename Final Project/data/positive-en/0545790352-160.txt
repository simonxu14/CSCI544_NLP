We purchased the Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone: The Illustrated Edition as a gift for our 10 year old daughter and she loves it. Although she has read the Harry Potter books numerous times she was ecstatic to receive this beautiful version and started reading it right away. If you are new to the Harry Potter series this is a wonderful way to be introduced to the characters and story. The illustrations are beautiful and our whole family loves how the art is seamlessly woven throughout the pages. If you are familiar with the story or have read the book, this will become your new beloved copy.<br /><br />I think we were all surprised by the size as it is a bit bigger (width and length) than the other versions to accommodate the artwork. Make sure you look at the dimensions so you know what to expect. However, this makes it a perfect version for enjoying personally as well as reading aloud with others.<br /><br />We love this series and would highly recommend this book for anybody's library.
