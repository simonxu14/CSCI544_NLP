Rowling has done it again. Keeping me up all night after a midnight run to Macroin's Bookstore to pick up Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. The best volume by far. Action!!! Adventure!!! and Wizards!!! What else can you ask for? Except for volume six.<br />In the works of Ben Diddlin, "This book ROCKS!!!!"
