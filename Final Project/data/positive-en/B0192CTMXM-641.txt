Harry, Harry, Harry... The wait was well worth it!  There are subtle differences in the way J. K. has written this book.  More detailed descriptions of scenario, events, characters, etc. Without trying to give the story away to those who have not yet read it, one of the first things you notice is that Harry is a teenage boy now.  J. K. has done well to present him in a 'true to life' light.  (Reminds me of my own teen son.)  The book is everything that we had thought it would be.  Suspenseful, funny, dark, and a bit scarey too.  All our beloved characters are here, as well as a host of new ones.  Pieces of the puzzle slowly start to fit around Harry.  Makes the story very fun. We have always had 'one million' questions, and in this book, a few are finally answered!  Harry is growing up, and hopefully so - the reader as well.  This is a lot of story for little ones'....<br />If this book makes it to the movies...  all I can say is "wow".  (and we will be the first in line,...again.)<br />We purchased the book, as well as the CD set, which is immense. It is 23 CD's at about 80 minutes each. Jim Dale is superb once again and fully brings the characters to life!  Mr. Dale has truly become part of our family!<br />The world of Harry Potter is a wonderful place to be!!!<br />J. K., Thank you...<br />PS: you certainly want to sock 'Cornelius Fudge' right in the nose! lol
