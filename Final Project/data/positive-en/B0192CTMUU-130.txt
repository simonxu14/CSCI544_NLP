My son, age 9, never was a strong reader.  I knew that if he were to try to read the Harry Potter series, he would get frustrated.  So I have the books and now the books on CD and he reads along with the book and CD.  He loves it!  He can't wait to finish the book and then watch the movie.  This worked for his older brother, who now reads so much I cannot keep up with books for him.  Thank you for having this.
