This book is very entertaining!  I read it in two days on a family road trip 4 years ago and loved it!!  The story is magical and I really enjoy the writing style.  The characters are likable and the story itself is quite imaginative. :)  There is some language, which makes it a book more for older kids, but, other than that, it is a good, fun book.
