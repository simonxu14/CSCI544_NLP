This was a gift for my daughters 24th birthday and she loved it!<br /><br />She has told me it was great and the illustrations were really cool!. The book arrived in new condition at a price that was at least 10% below what I could find anywhere else. I thought the cover was pretty neat.<br /><br />She rated this a very high 9.26 to 9.75 out of 10 - highly recommended for Harry Potter fans!
