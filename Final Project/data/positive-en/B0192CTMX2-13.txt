I read the first batch of reviews (posted on amazon) before the book came in the mail, and wonder now that I've read it, if we read the same book.  There was the "you're all going to Hell for reading this book" which made me shake my head and wonder what team the writer is playing for, and then some negative stuff:  "there's nudity in the book" (what?), "Herminone is reduced to a crying girl who does Ron's laundry (Hermione is the same decent compassionate level-headed character who saves the impulsive boys again and again), "Harry doesn't even do anything; its just luck." (Umm, have you read the other books at all?  That would be the pattern for our everyman hero.), "Ginny's just a tramp in this book." (Maybe with a lot of extrapolation in one scene, not key.)  I enjoyed this book.  For the last third, I couldn't put it down.  I started reading these books when my then 14 year old got the 3rd and read it in a day and a half.  Impressed, I asked to borrow it, and she insisted I start with the beginning.  The whole family have since become Harry fans.  Lot's of fun.
