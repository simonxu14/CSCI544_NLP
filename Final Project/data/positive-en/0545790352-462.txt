As a fan of Harry Potter from the beginning I was a bit skeptical that this new illustrated series would add all that much to the story, needless to say I am happily surprised. The book itself is amazingly made and the art brings the story into a whole new light. This has been expertly produced and would be great for long to Harry Potter fans or people who are yet to be fans. I look forward to picking up the rest of the illustrated series!
