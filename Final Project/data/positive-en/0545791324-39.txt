I am so happy I pre-ordered this! The owl post delivered it promptly, and what a lovely surprise months later after pre-ordering!  The binding and cover are high quality! Its perfect size to place on my lap while I real and flip through the beautiful artwork throughout the book! This is a MUST have treasure for any true potter fan! I am giddy with excitement!
