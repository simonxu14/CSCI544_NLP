As a Harry Potter fan, I was determined to buy this right away. The hardcover is beautiful. The images/drawings are just perfect. The font is large enough even for old people to read. This definitely brought me back to my childhood years. Each page has different pictures portraying each story it is conveying. I was a bit surprised that it was bigger than expected, but that is not a problem. I can't wait till they come out with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and the rest of the books. I definitely recommend this for all Harry Potter fans.
