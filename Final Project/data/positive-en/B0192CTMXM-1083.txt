I really enjoyed this book.  In my opinion Rowling has continued to grow into a wonderful writer and a comsumate story teller.  From time to time I hear complaints on her "clunky" prose, but I disagree.<br /><br />The story is compelling, consistant, well constructed, and just a heck of a lot of fun to read.  I am sorry to see Harry go, I don't think that my kids could possibly have enjoyed the series any more than I have.<br /><br />I can't wait to see what Rowling writes next.  I am hoping for adult oriented fiction.
