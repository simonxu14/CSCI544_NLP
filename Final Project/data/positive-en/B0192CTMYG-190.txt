LOVED IT!  I put off reading this book because it was touted as a kid's book.  Maybe so, but I was only two pages in to the book when I knew it would be a winner.  The story is so imaginative and well written that it  can touch that special place in each of us that retains some child-like  wonderment.  I read this book, then immediately ordered the next two in  the series.  Book four will be out soon and I can barely wait!  The story  flows smoothly, is well written and is occasionally laugh out loud funny.  It's an easy, fast-paced  read with interesting places and characters.  Come on! The sorting hat awaits us, and classes will soon begin again!  Escape from your Muggle life for a bit; after all, don't you crave a bit of  magic?
