I was a late Harry Potter fan to the series an I just had to read this book before the 2 final movies come out. Plus I was dying to know what happens at the end. The 7th book in the series by J.K. Rowling, while over 700 pages, keeps you in constant suspense while Harry, Ron and Hermoine are on the run from Voldemort and hunting down Horcruxes. I could not put this book down. Every chapter seemed to having something new that helped bring together all the events from the previous books. All Harry Potter fans will love this book as did I. It is a must have for your book collection.
