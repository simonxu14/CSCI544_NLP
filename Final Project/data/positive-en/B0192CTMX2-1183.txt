I only got started on the Harry Potter books at the end of '07 on the recommendation of my cousin.  She told me that I would love it and so far I have.  So far this is my favorite, I love the emotions and the lines that are starting to really be seen in the characters and watching them evolve is so real, I can remember feeling the same as some of the characters.  Awesome book for new and old readers.
