What else can I say?  What started for me as a whim (to read the first HP novel) grew into an insatiable need to read the conclusion to this masterpiece of storytelling.  Rowling is pure Genius, and I'll happily read any further novels she writes.  I HIGHLY Recommend that before you read HP7 (is there anyone left who hasn't?) start over & read all 7 novels in succession.  You will not regret putting off HP7 for a few extra weeks in order to bring all the details from the first 6 novels back into focus.  It's easy to forget important details from the previous novels (or worse, corrupted from the movies..).  Savor your time reading the whole series, as you'll never read a better story in your lifetime.
