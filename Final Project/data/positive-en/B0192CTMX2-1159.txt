I didn't buy this book for myself, I bought it for my Grandson.  Since I read the book a couple of years ago, my recollection isn't good enough to write a review.  I purchased the book for my Grandson to complete his set, and because he just loved the previous books, as did I.<br /><br />I would like to add that the book, though used, arrived in like new condition and in a timely manner.  I was very pleased with my purchase.
