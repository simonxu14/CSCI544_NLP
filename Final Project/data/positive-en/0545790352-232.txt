Quite literally the most beautiful book I've ever seen or had the pleasure to own. I'm a watercolor artist and a Harry Potter fanatic. This book is so incredibly lovely. The artist's interpretation of the story is so beautiful and accurate it's as though you're seeing this story with fresh eyes. My 12 year old son and I will be rereading this together at night before bed. The illustrator worked a miracle there as rarely do young teenage boys want to read stories with mom at that age anymore but between JK Rowling's inspired story and the magic captured in the art no one is immune to this book's spell. I highly recommend this book I cannot wait to purchase the others as they are released!
