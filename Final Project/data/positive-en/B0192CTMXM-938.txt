I just turned the last page of this long awaited book. Such a sad night for Muggles everywhere. My worst fears about the death of one of my favorite characters are confirmed, and while I am sure there is a greater purpose, I am deeply saddened.<br />On the other hand, I couldn't put the book down all day! What a wonderful adventure, with all the carefully laid clues of the previous books coming together to form such a perfectly weaved story. Dumbledore has answered most of my questions, although I do find there are a few still unresolved I would like to ask him myself.<br />Thanks to Ms. Rowling for letting millions of children find out the joys of reading. And giving us adults (or almost so) a glimpse at childhood again.
