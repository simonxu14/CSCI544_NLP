I can't seem to get enough of JK Rowling's wonderful writing.  Nor can I get enough of the brilliant reading performed by actor Jim Dale.  Every character has his or her own voice and style -- so clearly portrayed that I feel as if I am seeing and hearing each of the characters develop before my eyes and ears.<br /><br />Outstanding.  Bravo.
