Wow!  This was an amazing book.  Of course, the whole series has been such a joy to read.  The way the author ended it all was very gratifying, and yet there was a sadness that it was over and there would be no more Harry Potter to look forward to in the future.<br />My 4 yr old son has just taken an interest in Harry Potter.  We are starting at the beginning.  Each night I am reading him a few pages from the Sorcerer's Stone at bedtime.  As I read it, I am amazed at how well it ties in with the seventh book...like Ms. Rowling really does mean it when she says that she had the whole series plotted out from the beginning.<br />At least I get to enjoy these books again now, through the brand new eyes and ears of my young sons.
