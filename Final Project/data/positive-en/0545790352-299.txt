I was hesitant about buying another copy of the book (I have the original hard cover version, and an eBook version). But the illustrations are *lovely* and truly add to the experience of reading the book. I'm hoping that Rowling plans to produce illustrated versions of all 7 books, with Jim Kay as the illustrator of all of them. His work is amazing.<br /><br />Oh, and about the text of the book not being &#34;translated&#34; for U.S. audiences (other than changing &#34;Philosopher's Stone&#34; to &#34;Sorcerer's Stone&#34;): I am so glad to have a copy of the book with the original British words and phrases. I've thought all along that it's completely ridiculous to make wording changes for a U.S. audience. I just wish it had gone all the way and stuck with the proper British title as well.
