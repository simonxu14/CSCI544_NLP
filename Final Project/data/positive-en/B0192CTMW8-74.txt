If you're looking for a good book to read, your searches are over. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the book you have been looking for. J.K. Rowling (the author) has an amazing way of combining fiction, fantasy, science fiction, and mystery in one suspensful tale. Now, I, myself, am not  a big mystery, fantasy, or science fiction fan, but in this book, I really  didn't mind it at all! So go now and BUY THAT BOOK!
