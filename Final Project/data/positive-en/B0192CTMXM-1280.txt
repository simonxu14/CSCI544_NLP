If you've been a fan of the HP audio books - this one won't let you down. Jim Dale does an excellent job in the final installment. I wish he were the new Dumbledore in the movies.  The book exceeded my expectations - I was on the edge of my car seat :)  In case you haven't read it yet you know who dies don't you....
