After the stunning front page review in the New York Times, I wonder who would care to read my two cents worth here. After a marathon weekend reading I was sad because I did not want the wild ride to end ever. It is absolutely stunning how, novel after novel, JK Rowling has simply not lost her touch to weave this magical world. During a recent weekly business program on CNN an analyst suggested that probably the book has become so hyped because of the marketing muscle of all the big corporations. To which a NY Times journalist responded that people are not buying Harry Potter because Warner Bros or Scholastic cooked it up in their marketing programs but it is because of Rowling's writing prowess. And truer words were never spoken.<br />It is simply amazing that she has simply not given into any commercial pressures and stuck to her vision (I am sure editors must have asked her to reduce the size of the book). Yes Rowling is our queen.
