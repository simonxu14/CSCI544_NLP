This is the third book in the Harry Potter series. In this book we meet Harry and company once again on their way to Hogwarts, most of the book takes place at the school during the school year. The main plot of this book is that mass murderer Sirius Black has escaped from wizard prison and is out to get Harry. Sirius is also Harry's godfather and is supposedly the one that betrayed Harry's parents to Voldemort which eventually resulted in their death. As is often the case with the Harry Potter books, things are not so black and white as they are initially presented. 'Good guys' are actually bad, 'bad guys' turn out to be good; there are several exciting plot twists and the book ends on a somewhat happy note.
