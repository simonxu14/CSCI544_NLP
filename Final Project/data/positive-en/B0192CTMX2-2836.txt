I waited (like everyone else) for what seemed like ever for this one.  I was a little disappointed with Harry's rage.  In many respects, it is to be expected (he's had a hard life and he is a teenager) but part of what makes Harry so endearing is that he is still such a great, sweet and likeable kid in spite of everything he has gone through.  I know that all is not well in the wizarding world, but part of me wants to feel good at some point during the book.  That being said, I think that Rowling once again demonstrates the ability to keep readers enthralled and craving more (at least I am).  Not the best of the series, but given the build up and the wait, it was probably next to impossible to live up to everyones expectations. I am still anxiously awaiting number 6!!!
