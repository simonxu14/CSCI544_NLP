This book like the other 6 in the series, left me wanting more, but unlike the other 6 there will be no more and that makes me very sad.<br />Very good, highly interesting and as I said I wanted more. I did,<br />however, find the way she tied up the ends somewhat edifying.<br />Maybe she could write a series about the next generation.
