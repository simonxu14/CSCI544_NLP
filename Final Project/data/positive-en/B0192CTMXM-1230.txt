I am sorry that the Harry Potter series is ending.  This book is another engaging read.  Rowling does a good job of reminding us who characters are and how they fit together -- for those of us who read the previous book some time ago (or have poor memories).  Rowling's writing still creates the clearest pictures in the mind.  It's a great escape for this hip grandma.
