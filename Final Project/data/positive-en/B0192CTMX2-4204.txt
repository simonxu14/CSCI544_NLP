Exceeded every expectation I had for this book. I've been a Harry Potter fan since the first book and read every one. I didn't think this book could be any better than the Half Blood Prince....and this one did by far!! How Rowling managed to tie so many different story lines into one fantastic volumn I'll never know.  Meets and exceeds ALL expectations I had.<br /><br />Buy it!!!  You'll LOVE it!!
