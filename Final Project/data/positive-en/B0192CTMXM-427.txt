second time I've purchased this product.  First one was lent out and never returned and I like it so much I wanted to buy another so that I will always have it on hand.  I would warn buyers however, if you are buying this book for someone 13yrs or younger you may want to make sure to talk to them about it.  It is alot more dark and complex than the books early in the series.
