I am not kidding.  Harry Potter did  what five doctors and many others could not.  Harry Potter inspired my 9 year old learning disabled son to finally read. He took my paperback of Sorcerer's Stone and plods along.  Harry is his buddy.  Now, he dies to hear what I recently read in this book  -- which is BETTER than the first. I won't gie anything away, so he is  pushing to finish the first.  Reminds me of my Hardy Boys days or how I  watched my sisters swallow Nancy Drew or how the neighbor's kids ate up  R.L. Stine.  But, this is really the best of the lot.
