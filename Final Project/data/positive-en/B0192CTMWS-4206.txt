quite simply put, a perfect ending to a perfect series, one that is undoubtedly the most inspiring, captivating, and beloved of the last decade. forget the hollywood films, with their kid-like images cast about, forget all of the merchandise, all of the controversy. this is J.K. Rowling at her finest - clearly the master of storytelling, creating a world which has stolen the hearts and minds of millions of people around the world. this is what it all comes back to - the books, and this ending could not have been conjured up any better.<br /><br />thank you, J.K. Rowling, for giving us all a bit of hope in The Boy Who Lived for the past ten years
