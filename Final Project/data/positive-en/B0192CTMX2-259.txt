As a mother, a former teacher, and a lifetime reader I can only say that it is we who must thank you.  Nothing an individual can do in his/her lifetime can be greater than contributing in some positive way to the  growth of a child.  For you to have contributed so positively to the lives  of so many children is a gift so enormous it is beyond my ability to  describe.<br />I know that I have enjoyed these books as much as any of the  children who have written reviews did. And as I read each one of these  books I was struck with the power of the author's artistry and ability to  draw any reader into Harry Potter's world.  I couldn't wait to read each  next volume, and had to send to England for the second and third volumes  each time one was published!<br />So many children never experience the magic  of reading and the miracle of being transported to another place that  exists only in one's own imagination!!  Such is the creative power of  literature that does not exist for other forms of entertainment.<br />There  are those of us gifted with parents, a teacher, a relative or someone who  loved us enough to give us a love for reading.  But there are so many more  of those who are denied not only the pleasures but also the endless  benefits, direct and indirect, of the reader's life.<br />So many, many  children, lucky enough to be children today, while you are writing, will  become readers because of your books--who would not otherwise have done  so.<br />For that alone, if not for the intense pleasure of reading your work  and having before or behind us the delectable pleasure of reading it to our  children, I and everyone who loves children THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK  YOU!!!!!
