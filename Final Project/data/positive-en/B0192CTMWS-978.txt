I received this book via Fed Express from Amazaon on 6/21 and finished it today 6/24. It is the best in the series and answers many questions.The ending is just as exciting as the earlier books. One point that won't give away the plot is that in this book the reader learns that the stairway to the girls common room in charmed so as not to admit boys. It's pointed out that girls can go to the boys' common romm but not vice versa. No doubt the author added this in reaction to some critics whe would do anything to foil her success.I am 52 but have read all the books and seen the movies.This book also holds out assurance that the sequels should be ever as good.
