I am enjoying J.K. Rowling's books about Harry Potter - I don't want the series to end with only 7 books.  Maybe she'll continue to write more about Harry after the series is through.<br />This book continues Harry's life in the magical world.  In this book, Harry is force to relive some of his past.  I'm not sure if his past was repressed, or if it's just brougt to life by the dementors.  In either situation, Harry is forced to relive some of the worst moments of his life.  Harry is beginning to learn to deal with his past and understand where he is now.  He faces a figure from his past that had a lot of involvement with his parents.  The books ends in a way you would never expect; just when things seem to be over, new hope is found where you would least expect it.
