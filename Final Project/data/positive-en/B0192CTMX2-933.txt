Without a doubt the best ending for a series I've ever read. I cried and felt as though I was reading a very long letter from a dear group of friends. The deaths were stark and difficult, the ending although expected was a relief and the 19 years later was a joy. I will miss Harry and gang more than any other group of reading friends I've ever known. I shall reread them and continue to share them with others as I find kids and adults that either can't afford them or haven't had the opportunity to read them. Bless you Ms. Rowling for using your time, your wonderful mind and creativity to bring such fun, entertainment and joy to so many of us. Especially those of us who are ill and don't get out to live adventures of our own! Thank you.
