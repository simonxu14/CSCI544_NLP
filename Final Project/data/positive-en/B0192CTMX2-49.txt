Harry Potter once again taking us on a roller coaster of emotions, it is  seven and final installment of Harry Potter and the deathly hollows. You're mine will be written and rewritten with all kinds of emotions for certain characters who may die or may live.  I was at the edge of my seat the entire time I read this book knowing it would be the last of it's kind.
