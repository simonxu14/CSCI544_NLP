Having a middle age crisis? Read Harry Potter! What a delight to escape into such a fun, colorful tale of witches and wizards, spells and secret potions. You'll forget all about house payments and 9-5 and become a kid  again! My 11 year old daughter got me turned on to these marvelous books  and I couldn't put them down. Anxiously awaiting the third volume!
