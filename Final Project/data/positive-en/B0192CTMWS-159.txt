Finally!  The final chapter in the exciting Harry Potter adventures.<br /><br />This book was a fine addition to the Harry Potter series.  And while I would love to be able to give this book 5 stars, it falls short on too many levels to warrant it.<br /><br />This book turns the series on end.  Too many characters do almost a complete one hundred and eighty degree turn from where they have been in every book up to this point.  While I'm all about plot twists and turns, the inconsistencies certainly rack up in this final book.  Since I don't want this review to ruin any secrets for those that have yet to read the book, I'll just point out a few of the inconsistencies in general.  The Deathly Hallows never function as she describes them.  The explanation of the wands is so confusing, that even my friends and I can't exactly figure it out.  And she even changes her stance on the Horcruxes (not a lot, but enough to be in direct opposition to the last book).  The book also has a noticeable lull in the middle, which ruins the fast pace that is set by the beginning and end.<br /><br />This is also the darkest of all the Harry Potters, which is actually kind of a nice change.  It shows the characters to be in a "real" world, where there is loss and pain.  It also puts the three main characters in a position to really grow and be fully fleshed out.<br /><br />J.K. Rowling definitely writes a great book.  I have enjoyed all her books, including this one.  They are a great, easy, enjoyable read that keeps you coming back for more.  Her characters are very accessible, a person can definitely identify with their struggles.  Her plot twists are unique and believable.  Her stories are filled with lush characters and "magical" places.<br /><br />Inconsistencies aside, this is a wonderful read.<br /><br />So jump on your broom, and take Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows out for a spin around the Quidditch Field!
