She has done it again!  I couldn't imagine there being a better book than HBP, but JKR has done it again!!!  DH is an AMAZING book!  It keeps you on the edge of your seat almost the whole way through.  There is laughter, tears (lots), suspense, the list goes on.  I am so sad to know that the HP ride is actually over.  This movie is going to be killer!  Until then, all we can do is go back to the beginning . . .and start the adventures all over again.  Thanks JKR!
