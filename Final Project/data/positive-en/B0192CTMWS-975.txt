The education of young wizard-in-training Harry Potter continues in the _Prisoner of Azkaban_.  This time Harry is in danger from Sirius Black, recently escaped from the wizard's prison at Azkaban.  The story unfolds in beginning with the 3rd year of Harry's schooling, with more vivid characters and yet another mystery in a world where nothing is as it seems.  (This holds true for the story in its entirety as well.)  Once again Rowling has made kids of us all as you are drawn into her magical world.  Of particular interest to me was learning more of about the principal characters, especially Harry.  My favorite of the three.  Highly recommended for all ages.
