Grownups expecting another pleasant, light-hearted and ultimately reassuring visit to Hogwarts and Harry's world are going to be disappointed. "Order of the Phoenix" is a pretty unhappy book: Harry's alternately depressed and angry (and he has a right to be), Hogwarts is going to the dogs, the Ministry of Magic is as corrupt as the worst muggle political machine, and the world's lousiest Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher appears to be shockingly vile and sadistic. Harry and his circle of friends, which both expands and contracts, really show their mettle when the crunch comes, but loss and regret hang over the book, making it certainly the saddest of the Potter stories. Fifteen is a tough age, and it can't get much worse than it is in this book for poor old Harry.
