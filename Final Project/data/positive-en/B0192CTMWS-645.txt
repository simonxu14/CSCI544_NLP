My reaction to this book was very similar to what I had after reading "Goblet of Fire": I enjoyed yet another encounter between Harry and the Dursleys of Privet Drive, found the plot in between Privet Drive and the arrival to Hogwarts rather slow and boring, and then quickly became more engaged with the book once Harry and his companions settled in for their fifth year at Hogwarts.<br />For me the strength of this book lies in the Jan Umbridge character. She really does seem the embodiment of institutionalized evil, and her interactions with Harry and her stay at Hogwarts made me eager to turn the pages, wondering how the author would resolve her unwelcome stay at Hogwarts.<br />I found the book's conclusion once again very exciting, surprising, and revealing.<br />My only complaint might be the book's length. Longer does not necessarily mean better. Quite often I felt that the author's prolonged descriptions of things like the evolution of a character's demeanor during a verbal exchange did less for enhancing the story than it did in unnecessarily slowing down the book's tempo. This book likely has more words than Melville's "Moby Dick", yet alot less substance. Writer's who are encouraged to be more descriptive in their narrative ought to take that advice with a grain of salt. Sometimes<br /> aspects of a scene are better left to the reader's imagination.
