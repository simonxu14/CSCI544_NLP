I've read them all - usually in a few days after meeting the postman at the mailbox - then preferring to pass them on to others (only to find that my wife - another HP/JKR junkie) - has stashed them in the guest room.  We took our granddaughter to NYC to see Mary Poppins on Broadway - she brought a Potter/Rowling book along and buried her nose in it on the train to and from the City, through lunch and at every intermission [she had already read it ONCE and was going through it the second time!)  What can I say more?  Well, that this one is the beginning of the end of the series and pulls together many loose ends, answer questions I did not know I had and making sense of much while leaving plenty for #7!
