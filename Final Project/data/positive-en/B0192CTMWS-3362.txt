It starts off a bit slow, but this book is a winner!  An honest-to-goodness page turner, I could not put it down.  While it lacks the cover-to-cover emotional intensity of "The Prisoner of Azkaban", it does have a great number of shining moments.<br />There are any number of surprise appearances of almost-forgotten characters from other books.  A few scenes had me laughing out loud, and a few more had me weeping.  One of my most beloved characters, Neville, plays a bigger part than ever before...something that had me grinning from ear to ear.<br />And a final note - this is a dark, dark book....WAY darker than "Goblet of Fire".  To be honest, I don't know if I would read it to anyone under the age of 8 or so.  It was great...but dark.<br />Can't wait to see where this series goes next!
