I have been a 'Harry Potter Fan' since the American release of the first book and have pre-ordered all of the books since Book 2.  This time I pre-ordered the audio book (I have all of the previous books on unabridged audio book as well as hard bound book) but I elected to go to a local book store for the party and hype of the 12:01 release and pre-ordered the book.  It was a wonderful experience - even for this middle-aged mother of grown children - with no excuse of buying the book for a child / young adults.  After spending my time at the party and waiting for my copy, I arrived home at 1 AM Saturday morning and  I started reading - I finished the book early Sunday afternoon (we all need to sleep sometime, LOL).<br /><br />For my take - J K Rowling did a wonderful job wrapping up the story.  And, while I wish certain characters were not the ones who were killed, I understand her need to show the turmoil the magic community is going through to finally resolve the power of the Dark Lord and his death eaters.<br /><br />I'm a series reader - whether it's mystery / suspense or fantasy I read series and enjoy the continuity of characters and stories.  From Book One, J. K. Rowling did a wonderful job of character development and her little hints and continuity of plots were superior to so many other series offerings.<br /><br />I cried at times (though I have been known to cry at some commercials) and I re-read certain chapters - just because I wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything... Over all - it was a very fast read - well suitable to her continuing story and plotlines - the characters were true to form.  My only is that it's the last one - while I understand her design and desire to complete the story - Harry Potter and Hogwarts provided such an entertaining and character driven story that I will miss not having another book to look forward to next year or the year after.<br /><br />My sincere thanks and congratulations to J K Rowling (and her family- I'm sure it's not easy to live with a writer during the creative process) - Each and every book in the series was wonderful - faithful to the characters and story line.  If and when J K Rowling writes another novel - it will be on my must purchase list - she is a born story teller and I envy her talent.<br /><br />If you haven't read it do it quickly before someone ruins the book by telling you the high lights and or the ending.
