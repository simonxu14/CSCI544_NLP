I will never tire of reading these books.  As soon as I read the last line I am ready to begin the journey again.  This is by far the longest and most complex of the books, and while there is much sadness and devastation in this story, there are moments of sweetness and joy.  I was less than thrilled with the film's adaptation of this particular book, especially the battle of Hogwarts.  Having recently re-watched Part 2 of the film it was satisfying to read the original written story again.  In spite of some more significant deaths that occur.  Almost everyone who reads this, if anyone does in fact read it, has already read the books, but I'll refrain from anything too obvious, in the hopes that new generations will continue to discover and love this series as I have.
