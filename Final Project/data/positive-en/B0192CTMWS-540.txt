I will keep this spoiler free, so if I am vague about plot, that is why.  May I suggest that all other reviewers do the same, at least for the first month or two?<br />With each passing novel from JKR, I become more apprehensive that she will have lost her touch, that the shine will be gone.  Rest assured, dear readers, that this novel has all the magic, all the excitement, all the adventure that we have come to expect--and more.<br />The appearance of darker themes (death, consequences, truly evil villains who have an agenda that is definitely not wholesome) that marked the end of novel four were an unexpected twist for me.  I had heard that this was not a fluke, that she was taking the septology into a serious examination of what happens when someone truly evil rises to power; this is indeed what she appears to be doing.  Serious themes such as these form the backbone of the novel, and are apparent from the first pages.  This disconcerted me a bit, as I was expecting the usual romp through Privet drive, a la Dobby; instead, I got a much different thing.  The New York Times calls this section somewhat "ponderous", but I think that that is a specious view.  In reality, it was important to change the tone of the world, and she wanted to make sure that we understood that all was not mandarin oranges and ice cream here.<br />  As JKR has admitted in interviews, Harry is much more angry in this novel.  I felt that she handled this reasonably well--she does an excellent job portraying adolescent confusion.  It feels like Harry spends a lot of time being very distressed, but when you imagine yourself, at 15, in his situation, he is not necessarily unrealistic.  Teenage angst has been done better, but seeing this side of Harry is important in understanding how he is growing.<br /><br /> The plot is where Ms. Rowling really shines.  The Order of the Phoenix his one has significant plot twists where they should be, as well as where you least expect them.  Ron and Hermione are there in spades, and there is significant character development for all the major characters as well as a few minor characters.  We see new sides of McGonagall, Dumbledore, and Black, and Neville.  I was thrilled to see threads from novels 1-4 that seemed unimportant at the time be picked up and woven skillfully into the narrative.  Her grasp of the overall plan for her septology is admirable, and I am pleased that she even more careful a writer than any of us had anticipated.  This is a united whole, a well planned world.  This 7 book series has a definite beginning, middle, and an end, and we are in the thick of things now.<br /><br /> All the old charm is back as well.  Rowling's wit seems mostly absent for the first 100 pages, but don't give up hope. She was not not attempting to make the first hundred pages funny--she wants us to know she is in deadly earnest.  The wit is always bubbling under the surface, however, and later in the novel, there are a number of laugh out loud funny passages.<br /><br /> Descriptions, as always, are excellent.  I needn't add that the names of her characters are always interesting, funny, and often revealing.  Spells play an important role, of course, and their magic words never fail to amuse.<br /><br /> Please note: This is not a novel for 6 year olds.  They won't understand the adolescent issues.  The plot is not as scary as the end of the fourth novel, but the overall tone is dark, as has been much discussed.  Her literary style is much the same as the previous novels, but her vocabulary is becoming more advanced as Harry ages.  This is an excellent novel for the precocious 10 year old; I'm not sure I would let 7-8 year olds read it unless they are exceptionally mature.  No sex, but there is some violence, and as above, the dark themes.<br /><br />  Overall, I would say that this is--hands down--her best novel yet.  The climax left me literally breathless, turning pages as fast as I could, unable to believe what I was reading.  I look forward to her 6th installment in this series.<br /><br /> Well done, Ms. Rowling.  Keep up the amazing work.  Take your time on the next one--it will be well worth it when you do.  And whenever it comes, we'll still be here.
