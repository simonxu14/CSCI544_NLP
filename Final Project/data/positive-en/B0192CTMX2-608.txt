Poor Harry.  His fifth year at Hogwarts, and seems all the fun has been sucked out of attending this most magical of schools, both for Harry and for the readers. For too much of the book there is no Quidditch for Harry, no Hagrid, really, and scant "romance" with Cho (the one area of teenage-hood Rowling seems to have the most problem  understanding or describing is, well, SEX.  I can hardly imagine a single kiss is all a couple 15-year-olds can manage... and R. doesn't even write of it, just Harry's brief comments to Ron afterwards.)  O.K., teenage lust is not the point of these books, it just struck me as odd.<br />As far as new relevations about Harry, Voltemort, even Neville... well, nothing in Order of the Phoenix compares to the fourth book, which I do think is superior to this tome. The only "cool" new bit is the formation of what Ginny names "Dumbledore's Army", and the kid's (ultimately misguided, alas) battle with the Death Eaters.  It feels that  it is Dumbledore, and not Harry, who has to "save the day" in this book, which is a let down. OK - obviously I was a bit disapointed overall  by Order of the Phoenix, but then Rowling has, with the past four books, escalated our expectations and perhaps created for herself a hard act to follow (if you follow what I am trying to say!) I expect as the story winds down the last two books - particularily book 7 - shall prove quite exciting.  Book 5 just feels like we all had to get through another school year.
