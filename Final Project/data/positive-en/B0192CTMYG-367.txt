When I first saw Harry Potter in the book stores, I didn't know what the fuss was about. It went on for a few months when I decided to pick up the book and read the first few pages of the story. I was hooked on the book.<br />I bought all four books that same day. Later, I learned that my 10 year old cousin Anthony was crazy about Harry Potter books. We have chatted about the future stories concerning Harry Potter and wondering what the movie that is to come out in a few weeks would be like.<br />This book and series is not just for kids but for adults too.
