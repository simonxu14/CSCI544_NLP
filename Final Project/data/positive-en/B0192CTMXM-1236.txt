The last book was well worth the wait.  It was impossible to put down!  Every time I thought I had it figured out, another shock changed my train of thought.  Well written, stimulating and riviting.  I am thrilled with the ending, and happy that the series ended in such a wonderful manner.<br />The series may be at an end, but Harry will live on, in all of our hearts.
