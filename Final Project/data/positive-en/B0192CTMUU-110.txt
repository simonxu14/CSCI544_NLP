I know nearly every word by heart, that's how much I love this series.  Honestly, I've never read them.  Instead, I've listened to Jim Dale's amazing interpretation as he's brought each character to life, changing his voice as they age, imitate others, or change moods.  He has invented voices for minor characters, major characters that run throughout the series, and creatures we mere muggles have never heard of, which has earned him multiple places in the Guinness Book of Records for creating more voices for a series.  I bought these CD's because, frankly, I'm wearing out the tapes I bought when the books first came out.  Yes, I'm an addict, but I haven't found a HPA (Harry Potter Anonymous) group to join.  To be honest, I'm not sure I'd join if I found one.
