I really enjoyed the book!  I received the book yesterday (via amazon.com) and I tried my best to savor it...to let it last...but alas!  I kept turning the pages and before I knew it, I had finished the book!<br />  Because it went so fast, you know that it is good!  Wonderfully written,  great moral lessons for children (such as the value of friendship, standing  up for what you think is right) and it hits close to home for what young  people in that age range experience (such as early heart pangs with respect  to dating).
