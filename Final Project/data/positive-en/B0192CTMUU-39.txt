I am a huge Harry Potter fan, I already have all the books in print but I wanted to re-read them for about the 100th time and decided to break down and get the ebooks.  I love Harry Potter they are so well written and it doesn't matter if it is the 1st time you have read it or the 100th time you have read it you get lost in the story.
