I was very late to the Harry Potter rush.  When I had initially heard about the "little kids books" involving Harry Potter, I thought Potter was the author.  Only once the movie came out did I start reading the books.  I literally couldn't put them down.  I read all 4 books in about 3 weeks total.  I'm now reading them aloud to my 4 1/2 year old, who of couse doesn't get it all, but loves them anyway.<br />Trust me, these books are absolutely fantastic!  As long as you're between the ages of 4 and 114, you will love them!
