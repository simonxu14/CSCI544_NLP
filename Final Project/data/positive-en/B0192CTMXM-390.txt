I thought the last installment was great! It was an extremely fast read despite the number of pages and a lot of mysteries were revealed. We learned the truth about Snape and Dumbledore and were given greater insight into their characters.<br /><br />The only thing that irked me was the suddeness of the ending. I wanted to find out more about what happened after the battle and I felt that an epilogue of 19 years later was too large of a gap.<br /><br />This was still probably the best series ever. =)
