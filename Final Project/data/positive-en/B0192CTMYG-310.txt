Harry Potter is just an average boy.  Average...until he stops the most powerful dark wizard in a century in his tracks as a baby!  Since then, the name Harry Potter is known all through the wizarding world.  Harry Potter is famous for stopping Voldemort.  Harry's parents are killed by Voldemort, and Voldemort tried to kill Harry, but failed.  This is why Harry is Famous.  He's the hero who stopped the dark lord.<br />  Harry then gets drop off at his Aunt's and Uncle's house by Albus Dumbledore.  Harry is less than famous at Privet Drive. In fact, he's close to being invisible in the Dursley household.  He never gets any mail, doesn't have any friends, and his life is pretty much miserable under the stairs where he lives.  All that chages when Harry gets a letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Harry finds out that he is a wizard, and his parents were wizards (duh!).<br />  And so, Harry goes to Hogwarts.  There, he makes some friends (and enemies).<br />  A great read for both kids and aldults!
