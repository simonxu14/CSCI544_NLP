When I first received my order, it was a cheaply-made copy with thin pages.  Found out later that it was a &#34;library binding&#34;.  Looking at the title on the webpage, it was the default edition.  Amazon had a very helpful customer service rep.  He helped me get it all sorted out, told me how to return it for a refund and place a reorder for the regular edition.  Be careful if you order online without a person to guide you, or take careful notice of what edition you are ordering.  The replacement was received promptly, and it was the high-quality, well-bound edition with thick pages that I was expecting.  The story needs no review.  This book was to replace one we'd gotten at first release, loaned to a friend and never got back; so we'd read it before and knew it was worth getting again.  The same for book #7.  I cancelled my order for the library edition before it was shipped and reordered the standard edition.
