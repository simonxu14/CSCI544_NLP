I liked the book, keeping in mind that the version I have is the braille version, so my rating is primarily concerning the format of the book, and not its plot. This is an excellent book to put into braille format and I hope that the sequels are also done. I can see but I am a braille reader and transcriptionist, and this book is nicely packaged and well-bound. I did note several typographical errors in the book, but not more than usually found in an ink-printed book. Five stars would have been for zero errors, as otherwise what's not to like about Harry Potter?
