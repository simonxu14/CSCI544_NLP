I love ALL of the Harry Potter books, but love this one the best.  It is sad and happy and answers all of the questions that I had going into this book.  If you love a complicated plot, with lots of sub-plots, as I do, then you should read Harry Potter.  There is a great diversity among characters and they are well developed.  Harry is not perfect... and that is why he needs help from his friends and teachers.  He is very human.  There were a few surprises in this book for me as all of the loose ends tie up by the end.
