This is a great book and the Narrator is fantastic.  He really pulls you into the story.  My kids love to listen to this and it is so good that I am happy to listen with them.  It makes trips in the car so much fun.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes a great adventure story that makes you use your imagination.
