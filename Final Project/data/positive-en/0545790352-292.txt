This is not a graphic novel or a shortened version of the book with illustrations.  This is THE FULL FIRST book, just like how would have first read it all those years ago.  The illustration are gorgeous and even on the pages where there isn't a picture there are small details on the page.  Can't recommend this enough and I can't wait for the rest of the books to come out!!!
