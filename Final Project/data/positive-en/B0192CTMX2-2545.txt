This review is spoiler free!<br /><br />I have just raced through Harry Potter 7 in a span of 18 hours. In a way, I'm kicking myself. I should have dragged it out, enjoyed the journey more. Let the last story roll over me during the week.<br /><br />But the book was impossible to put down. After a slow start of picking up the pieces, it reaches an unbearable intensity level that rips through to the last page.  Unrelenting is the word I would use. There may be some who dislike this book as it does not take its time to enjoy the scenery. It rushes. But then, you won't want it to slow down.<br /><br />Again, staying away from spoilers, I can tell you that this book differs from the others. Almost the entire book is focused, laser-like, on Ron, Hermione and Harry as the they to unravel the mysteries of the last six books. But no one is forgotten. All the past characters get their moments to shine. And if any of them fall, they fall with wand in hand. You will not feel cheated.<br /><br />The final confrontation - that's not a spoiler, you knew there'd be one -- is handled with Rowling's usual skill and grace. It does not disappoint. After seven books and some, what? 3000 pages? You will close the book knowing it ended the way it should. And that the journey was worth it.<br /><br />The best thing is that Rowling answers all the questions, touches on all the details, never seems to forget a single thread. The backstory is explained, unravelling mysteries that have been around since Book One.<br /><br />As the title of my review says, when you finish this book, there will be only one question remaining...<br /><br />Now what?
