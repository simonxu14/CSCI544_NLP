Just incredible... that's all I can say.  As a avid fan of the Books, there have always been spoilers and security leaks and no matter how many you hear or come across, they're quickly forgotten as soon as you get the book in your hands.  Most spoilers are terribly wrong anyway.  This book was great, and even greater was that in interviews, JKRowling answered any additional questions fans had.  Just a great series.  I'm sad to see it end.
