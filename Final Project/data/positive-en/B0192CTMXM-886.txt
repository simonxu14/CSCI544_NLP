The final chapter of Harry Potter met all my expectations. I sat down the day I got the hardcover and read it over the weekend. We then purchased the Audio version. Jim Dale does an excellent presentation and is enjoyable listening. I am sad that this is the last of Harry Potter and anticipate new ventures coming from Ms Rowland. I highly recommend the audio version as well as the hardcover edition. As adults we have enjoyed the amazing imagination of Ms Rowland and compare her storytelling abilities to JR Tolkien. I do not believe the Harry Potter books are suitable for young children however, and recommend that they are far more appropriate for 13 year olds and above. The tend to be dark and far too intense and violent for the very young.
