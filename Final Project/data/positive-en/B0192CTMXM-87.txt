I'm not going to say why I cried, because that would spoil the whole book (warning: DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT read the review: Harry Potter Rocks! A Kid's Review. It gives away the ending!) But, I will say that that ending made me CRY! And I'm nearly 21 years old.<br /><br />How does one go about describing the Harry Potter books? They're almost indescribable! These books are so full of every emotion, every type of person and creature. They draw you in as the pensieve does into one's thoughts. As Harry witnesses Snape's worst memory (and trust me, you like I will actually feel sympathy towards Snape, believe me!) it is as though he is standing right there amongst his father, Sirius, Lupin and Wormtail. This is how I feel when I read these books. I feel as though I am right there with Harry, Ron and Hermione through every struggle, every injustice, every adventure no matter how dark or hopeless. I cry their tears, I burn with their sense of injustice, my heart leaps with theirs at every victory.<br /><br />But on to the story. The 5th year is the worst yet, no one will admit that You-Know-Who is back, all summer long The Prophet is making Harry look like an attention-grabbing, lying lunatic. Meanwhile, Harry has not seen his friends or Dumbledore all summer, and when they write they are incredibly vague, understandably frustrating after all the horrors Harry witnessed at the end of his 4th year. Then, before you know it, he is under magical attack on Privet Drive!<br /><br />Matters don't improve, Harry risks being expelled from no fault of his and Hogwarts is now under strict control from the Ministry of Magic, led by none other than the blind-to-all-facts Cornelius Fudge. Hagrid has disappeared and Harry is thwarted left and right in all the things he loves and needs to do!<br /><br />I don't understand how anyone could say that these books have been going downhill since the last 150 pages of year 4!? In my opinion, Prisoner of Azkaban was the best yet after years 1 & 2 and Goblet of Fire was better still! This book now is more on the lines of the end of Goblet of Fire, things are getting darker and more ominous and more difficult for everyone. And this is appropriate! With the return of the Dark Lord (eww) we must naturally expect that life will no longer be as fun. But lighten up, there are some truly funny scenes, and a little romance too! But, times are just not as carefree (if they could ever be called so) as they used to be.<br /><br />Someone said that Harry has no sense of humor anymore. I ask you, would you be full of laughs if you had seen the return of free magic's WORST ENEMY, seen someone die and then have to endure a year of people not believing you, teachers trying to discredit you, people you liked turning against you, insanity charges, visions of You-Know-Who doing his dirty work, all your favorite things being taken away? How would you feel if you thought all the world was against you??? These are the struggles Harry must endure, he is run through the mill, his limits are tested to the max, and we all must hope that he is able to survive it all. I'm not sure I could take it and I'm presently 6 years older than him! As they say, what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger, this will be Harry's test in the future books.<br /><br />Seems so real, doesn't it? Rowling has a style that makes you believe she is writing a biography! But it's more like watching a film of someone's life and walking right into that film and feeling every single thing that they feel, being in the same dangers, loving and caring about the same friends and almost-family. It's really like what Harry felt when he looked through Voldemort's (shudder) eyes and felt what he was feeling, did what he did but was powerless to stop it.<br /><br />Harry is tested to his limit in the Order of the Phoenix, he endures things no human should have to suffer, and he will receive a warning that may change his views and way of life forever. I don't envy poor Dumbledore, on his shoulders seems to rest the weight of the world, and now Harry must truly shoulder some of that weight. Dumbledore can no longer protect Harry from the worst, and in trying to protect him from the ultimate truth up to this point, Dumbledore may have made a very grave and horrible mistake.<br /><br />This book is wonderful, heart-breaking, astounding, depressing, and truly amazing all at the same time. World-Class author, kudos Ms. Rowling! How could I ever have been skeptical of these books??? They are now amongst my ALL-TIME favorites! I hope book 6 is released soon, I'm not sure I can stand the wait!
