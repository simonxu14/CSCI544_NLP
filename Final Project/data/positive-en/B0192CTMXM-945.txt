For years now, I have looked forward to the next part of the Harry Potter story. This is the last part of his story. I will not post any spoilers here. This book was as exciting as the previous six, although at the end of this book you know that it is the end and that it is final. Ms. Rowling does not waste any time getting into the the action of the story, and I found it very difficult to put the book down for the first several chapters. I hope that all that read this book enjoy it as much as I did. And if this is your first Harry Potter book shame on you. Do yourself a favor read the previous six first. It may sound like a daunting task but it is well worth it and goes a whole lot faster than you would think. ;)
