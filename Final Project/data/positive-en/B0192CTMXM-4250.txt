this book was written from an outline, filled in well in some spots, sketchy in others. an editor could have helped trim the fat, and encourage filling in the thin sections. to blur past the death of significant characters, but spend long pages detailing months of camping in the woods, made the book frustrating and boring by turns. and, the epilogue gave way too few answers as to the outcome for the survivors. good combat scenes in sections, with rowling stealing some good parts from others, particularly sigourney weaver's famous line from aliens 2. i think this will make a better movie than book.
