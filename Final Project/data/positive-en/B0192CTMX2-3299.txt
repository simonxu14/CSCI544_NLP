A fitting end to an amazing series. Bravo to Rowling for her creativity. We were captivated by the action, the underlying romances, the inevitable death of Voldemort or Harry---. My only criticism is I wish she would have explored Snape's leadership of Hogwarts a bit more. I would have liked to see the actions tie in with the end discovery of Snapes true character. Other than that, truly brilliant. She deserves every penny she's made on this book. Made a lot of Muggles happy.
