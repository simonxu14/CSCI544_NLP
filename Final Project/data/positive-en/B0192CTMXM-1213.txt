The long wait was well worth it!This book has a beautiful cover a great story to match it!I am only depressed by the death,but not even that could spoil such a great book.Plus there is even more drama and mystery.The clues are so subtle that you could read right through it without even a second thought.I have to say J.K.Rowling is a genius.Period.This book is proof enough.
