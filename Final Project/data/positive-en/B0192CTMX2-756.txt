This book was wonderful, although not many people will find an angry Harry Potter so amusing through most of the book!<br />I loved how the Ministry of Magic refuses to see what Dumbledore proposes - the return of Lord Voldemort.  It's "realistic" (as far as a magical world can go) with people's attitudes and mindsets.<br />The personalities of all the characters you take notice of are unique and many can be well-loved.  Remus Lupin, for example, while not a very large part in the story.  The same can go when thinking about Severus Snape - yes, he's a slimy-haired git, and yes, he's mean, but for those who didn't look past that (i'm not saying ignore it, i'm saying look further) before this book will be forced to just a little bit by the time this book ends.<br />Many themes are presented in this book, yet it is presented in a "safe" way so that the younger the audience gets, the less likely it is for those few themes in the book to be seen, and if they are, it is likely that since the reader was mature enough to see it, they would be mature enough to understand it.
