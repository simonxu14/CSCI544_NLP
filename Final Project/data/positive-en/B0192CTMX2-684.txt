Order of the Phoenix, while not as good as Goblet of Fire, is still a damn good read.  My only complaint against the book would be the rehash of plots and devices from previous books.  I understand that Ms. Rowling has a seven book series in mind, but maybe some new plot devices would be in order.  That being said, this book is a must-read for any Harry Potter fan.  The thing about this book is that it's beginning to move out of the realm of children's books into the young adult world.  The characters are of course growing up and dealing with all the problems of teenagers their age, but the action is also becoming more adult as Lord Voldemort becomes ever braver in his attempts to take over the wizard world.  One of the great things about this book is the back history of the story, which allows some character's actions to be better understood.  In addition, a few of the characters make a serious turn in development as they accept the inevitability of events, that they must change in order to survive and be on the side of righteousness.  Like Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix features the death of a beloved character that is totally unexpected and will bring a tear to the eye of any avid reader, so parents should once again be cautioned.
