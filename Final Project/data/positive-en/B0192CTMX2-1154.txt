To start with I loved this book and am well over 13, actually a grandmother.  I just love the names in these books and say them outloud, relishing each one: Hogwarts, Gryffindor, Quidditch.  How about the names of the characters?  Don't you just want to hiss at a name like "Draco Malfoy from Slytherin"?  Or how about the slightly ditsy Luna Lovegood, or Moaning Mytle who haunts the girls' bathroom.  It is just such fun read.
