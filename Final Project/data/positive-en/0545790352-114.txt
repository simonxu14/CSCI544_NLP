I love love love love this book. It is amazing to see come to life! I have read the book countless of times and now my 8 year old is enjoying it fully illustrated. I purchased it in Spanish as well and hoping to get my son excited about learning how to read in a new language. The entire thing just looks wonderful on my coffee table. May purchase a few more copies as gifts this christmas.
