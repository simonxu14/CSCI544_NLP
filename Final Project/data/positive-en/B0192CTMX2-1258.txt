I don't know what else can be said about Harry Potter. It was a fantastic read and I'm very happy with how the series ended. I'm amazed by J.K. Rowling and her ability to tie everything from all seven books together in some form or another to create such a wonderful series. I cannot wait to read these books with my children and pass the series on!
