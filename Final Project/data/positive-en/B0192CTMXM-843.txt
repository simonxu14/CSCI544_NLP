More adventure and a thicker plot,J. K.  Rowlings "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoneix"  makes you want to become a part of the Wizarding World. Nothing in the Order of The Phoenix is the way it seems. The suspensful plot of this book comes alive for every reader; from the first page to the final moments. Harry Potter has now becomem a full- blown teenager, which many can relate to. Harry's trials and tribulations with his Fifth year at Hogwarts is nothing like any year he has attended. Harry realizes that his friends are the most important thing he has in life, controling his thoughts and thinking before acting is incredibly crucial, and most importantly, Potter will have many hard times ahead of him but he must stay strong and faithful, and never give up. I highly recommend this book for anyone who needs an extra boost for the summer, this book really does take you to another world.
