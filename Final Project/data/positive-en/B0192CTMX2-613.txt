I received my copy on Saturday and finished early Sunday morning.  This is a book you simply cannot put down.  While I thought number 4 was truly great, this one actually surpasses it.  Now a teenager with the normal teenage angst, Harry must also deal with the horrors of only two months ago, with nightmares and no one in his Muggle world in whom he can confide.  Even Professor Dumbledore is distant, while Ron and Hermione write infuriatingly vague letters. When excitement suddenly enters his Muggle world, he realizes again that he's still a target of those who wish him ill.  At long last, he's back at school, only to find a particularly loathsome new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher: Dolores Umbridge, who looks like a toad and plainly despises Harry and anyone connected to him. Life is more and more complicated, as the fifth years prepare for their Ordinary Wizarding Levels examinations (O.W.Ls), vivid dreams about long hallways and closed doors haunt Harry, teachers come under professional attack, and the wizard world is poised to tear itself apart from within.<br />Simply reading the chapter titles was exciting.  One title caused me to make an assumption about the major character slated to die.  Let's just say I was way off the mark.  Thank goodness.<br />Buy this book!  Collect the whole set.  Then read them aloud to your friends.  They are so worth it--the classic story of good versus evil, told by an author with a mesmerizing storytelling gift.
