Ms. Rowling was perfectly right when she wrote that the sixth volume is<br />not a finished work. To understand it, one has to read the seventh<br />volume too. After reading&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-Book-6/dp/0439785960/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Book 6)</a>&nbsp;no-one understood<br />Dumbledore's death, for example, and the most logical explanation<br />seemed to be that he got absolutely senile by old age and did not<br />know what he was doing. (...)<br /><br />Another unexplained line was Professor Snape. A logically thinking<br />reader of course felt sure that he worked for Dumbledore and some of<br />the most gifted might also have guessed that he had a grievous grudge<br />against the Dark Lord and a more serious one against James Potter than<br />the one earlier stated. (...)<br /><br />(...)  His father and friends were much better skilled than he<br />can ever dream of (learning to transfigure themselves and the<br />construction of the Marauder's Map are the best proof). His major<br />virtue is apparently the one he needed as a seeker in Quidditch: he<br />does not rest until he has the Snitch in his hand and trusts the<br />others to fend off the Bludgers. He works for his team, which means that<br />he has to catch the one that brings an end to the match. Perfect<br />symbolism. Nicely done. Thank you Ms. Rowling.
