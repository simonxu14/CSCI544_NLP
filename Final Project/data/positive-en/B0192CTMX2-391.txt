Minute details bog down the first 112 pages of this most recent addition to the series.  It took me two weeks to read as far in the book.  Once Harry arrives at Hogwarts for his 5th year, the story takes off at a feverish pace.  Dolores Umbridge is perhaps the most hated character ever to be introduced in the series (perhaps even more than Volde... oops, He Who Must Not Be Named).  J.K. Rowling's literary style has matured along with Harry and I anxiously await number 6 in the series.
