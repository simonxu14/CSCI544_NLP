My wife and I have enjoyed listening to the whole Potter series on CD.  While the first one worked well, in book two, the narator Jim Dale really comes into his own.  With his destinctive voices, dramatic florish and excellent sense of comic timing he brings the book to life for the listener.  Though I found the books a little dry as a read, they make a wonderful performance and I would urge anyone who enjoys books on CD to add this and the rest of the series to their collections.
