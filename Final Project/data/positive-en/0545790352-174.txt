Book arrived in a semi-timely manner, but the tracking never worked for me. It also arrived in a simple bubble mailer, causing there to be some damaging to the dust cover. While the damage did occur, it did its job of protecting the book! The illustrations are amazing and my husband can't wait to share this book with our son!
