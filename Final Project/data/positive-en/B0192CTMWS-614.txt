The Harry Potter series will stand, not on it's merit, but on its social impact. The Deathly Hallows is the culmination of an important chapter in so many adolescent lives that it hardly matters whether it is a good book or not.<br /><br />But, the fact is it does fall short. The whimsy of Hogwarts has always set it apart from run-of-the mill fantasy stories, but that important feature is missing in this volume. Without the characters attending Hogwarts, the story settles into a derivative "quest" epic. It's not a bad one as quests go. Maybe a little slow and dreary, as the first 500 pages serve to simply drive home the point that times are dark indeed. It has decent puzzles, mysteries, and plot twists. But, it lacks anything to rise above the standard fare in that genre.<br /><br />The bigger problem though, is the poor fit of the characters we all know and love in the epic battle against evil. It is necessarily a violent struggle, with death and mayhem. But, Harry Potter and his friends are gentle children. Putting them into fierce battle scenes simply doesn't work. There are too many contrivances that served to avoid having them actually seriously hurt anyone. That conflict could have been shaped into a moral dilemma, but instead it just feels awkward, as if they wandered into this story by mistake.<br /><br />In the end though, it is a satisfying conclusion. The challenge for Rowling was to add some surprise to the climax, not suspense. In that regard, she succeeded.
