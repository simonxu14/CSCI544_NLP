This book was AWESOME!!! Everything I expected and much more! Before reading it I was NOT looking forward to the end of this series, but J.K. Rowling is just incredible.  While this book is darker than the others, and yes, there is some real sadness, there is also complete "closure". Beautifully done. Well worth the wait!
