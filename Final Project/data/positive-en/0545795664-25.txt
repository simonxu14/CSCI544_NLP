Purchased as a gift for my sons 7th birthday,it was his favorite gift!<br />Pros: lots of Pokemon listed with them abilities and its evolved forms<br />Its like a book form of a Poke Dex<br />Book is sturdy and pages are tough to tear, so it can withstand him carrying it with him everywhere and showing it off to people over and over.<br />Cons: I saw none, it came fast and it was packed well in a box with bubble wrap.<br />Recommend: Yes, if you have a Pokemon fan they will be so happy to receive one of these, and you will be a hit since you can't find things like this in a local store.
