This book was definitely worth the wait.  Granted, it's a lot darker than the other four Harry Potter books, and Harry's got more of an attitude this time around--which is completely understandable, considering everything he's gone through, particularly in book 4--but that just goes to show how he's growing up and dealing with the nasty turn of events in his life.  One of the best things I like about this book are the villains...this book has *definitely* taught me that Snape sure isn't the worst person out there, in the wizarding world.  Especially that new "Defense against the Dark Arts" professor...she sure is like poisoned honey.  Or maybe an ugly toad-green apple that's rotten through and through.  Anyway...this book was an excellent read, and I can't wait till book 6 comes out. :)
