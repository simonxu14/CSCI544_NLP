This book is an excellent addition to the Harry Potter collection, particularly for the adult reader.  While longer than Book 4, the writing is much tighter and cohesive.  You're constantly fed useful information, often through action sequences rather than lengthy exposition.  As is true in most of Rowling's other books, although this is aimed at kids, nothing is spoonfed to the reader.<br />Many have said this book represents a darker turn in Harry's life.  Having read it, I think the books and the characters are simply growing up.  Things are not so black & white anymore.  Harry now has to deal with things in greyer terms.  This made the story even more appealing to me than previous books.<br />There are certainly more horrific scenes in this one than in previous books.  There's plenty of danger.  I would recommend that parents of younger children likely to be bothered by intense scenes take some time to talk to their kids as they read the novel.  I'm sure some good questions and discussion can be raised from the book regarding morals and the evolving definition of right and wrong.<br />As a fan of fanfiction, I must say that there's plenty of teasers in here to keep the fanon community happy.  Alot of the characters are changed by the end of the book, with more signs that others will be.  Material to ignite the imagination abounds.
