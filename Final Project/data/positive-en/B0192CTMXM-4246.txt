I'm an avid reader of all types of books both fiction, and non fiction, both for entertainment and learning. In short I just love reading, but this series has gone above and beyond both my expectations and my hopes. The writing in latest and final addition to the Potterverse is truly worthy of being called great literature. Everything about the story and it's conclusion are perfect and while it is disheartening to know it has all come to an end a magnificent end it is. All the characters are perfect and show the love Rowling has for them and the world she has created. Every new twist and turn and heartfelt moment reflects the tenderness and gratitude she has for her fans. If you have not read the Harry Potter series you need to. It is classic and also the history of a decent writer turning into a literary genius to match that of Tolkien, Poe, and even Homer. This book was the perfect end to a wonderful series and will go down in the history of literature of everything an ending should be.
