while I didn't like this one as much as the earlier ones it was still a great read. It was a more adult book than the earlier ones with more violence. The author rounded up the futures of the principles in the book to give the readers a glimpse of where they went but it was very brief. I haven't looked forward to a book so much in 30 years and I don't think you will be disappointed. I highly recommend
