I did not "meet" Harry Potter until January 2001 when I read the Sorcerer's Stone for an undergraduate college course dealing with forms of literature throughout our lives (from children's to adult books). I was intrigued by Harry and sought out his other books, eventually purchasing the set for myself.<br /><br />Since Order of the Phoenix, I have been a die-hard Harry fan. Rowling has spun an enchanting tale that has obviously done some good since people are so willing to fight and argue about whether or not this or that happened after each subsequent book was published.<br /><br />This final installment was much anticipated for me. I wanted to know if all of the rumors were true, and could this book possibly live up to the hype? For me, it did. It was everything to me a good book should be: some parts were funny, some parts were sad; there was bravery and cowardice.<br /><br />The epilogue left something to be desired for me...simply because I wanted to know MORE than she gave. There were also several parts where I felt like she "hurried" across them without adequate explanation and I was again left wanting more details. Overall, however, I was glued to this book from the beginning and am sad that Harry's journey is over.<br /><br />It was worthwhile and I think it speaks a lot that people all over the world have been so enraptured in "Harry-mania".
