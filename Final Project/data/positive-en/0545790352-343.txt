I was so excited when I received this book. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning. The illustrations are absolutely BEAUTIFUL. They're beyond anything I could have imagined. The book is a very nice size, is very sturdy, and even has an attached bookmark to hold your place. I wish I could give this book 10 stars! If you're an avid Harry Potter fan like myself you MUST get this. I can't wait to see what's in store for the rest of the series.
