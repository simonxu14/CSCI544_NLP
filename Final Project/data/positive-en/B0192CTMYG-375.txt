I bought this book to read to our 4 and 6 year old grandsons during our vacation.  They are normally very rambunctious so I was looking for something to give us all a little "quiet time" in the evening.  The 6 year old was absolutely mesmerized and kept wanting to hear "just a little more".  He had already seen the movie but this didn't diminish his enjoyment at all.  The 4 year old, on the other hand, quickly lost interest - no pictures and too much narrative for his attention span.
