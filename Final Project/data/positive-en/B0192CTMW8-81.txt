Not my favorite book in the series, but you'll probably hear that about the first two books from a lot of people. By all means this is an important book in the series and I'd never suggest anyone skip this one over or read it half-heartedly, but thankfully this is the last book you'll read in the series before you realize that there is more darkness to the Harry Potter universe than anyone first noticed.
