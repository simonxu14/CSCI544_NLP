I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Do remember though, it's a screenplay, which means dialogues and brief setting passages. After the Harry Potter series, the next big book to look forward to was The Cursed Child screenplay. However, that fell short since it's not entirely written by J.K. Rowling, and if you're a true HP fan you can feel it whist reading it. This book was different altogether since J.K. Rowling indeed only wrote it. The book was precise, offered great description to the various creatures that have been introduced. Within the first few pages, you immediately get attached to Newt for his quirky personality. The best part of this book is? As a Harry Potter fan I'm able to return to the wizarding world but not affect the original series, since the series and story are already completed at the end of Deathly Hallows.
