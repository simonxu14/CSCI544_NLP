I have read both book 1 and book 2. I know I'm a little late on the Harry Potter wagon, but I found both of these books very well written and entertaining. I liked book 1 a little more than book 2. I thought the second one was a little more unbelievable, but on the whole, still very good. I'm just about ready to read the 3rd book. I hope it is just as good as the others!
