Better than #4, better than #3, better than #2, almost as good as #1. Darker in tone, and more mature, but this is to be expected as both Harry and his readers are getting older. I couldn't put it down. Anyone who thinks the Harry Potter books are "kid stuff" will lose that misconception after they read this. I normally shy away from fads and popular series like I would from blast-ended skrewts, but these books are as good as they're made out to be, and this is one of the best. Read it!
