I did not read this until after I had seen the movie, so I had the visuals playing in my head as I read, down to Newt's awkward lovability and Jacob's wonder.  Even without seeing the movie first, though, this screenplay gives you enough story to be able to appreciate the dangers of this new Wizarding world.
