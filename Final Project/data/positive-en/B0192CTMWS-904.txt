If you have not read this book yet this is the review for you.  I will spoil nothing.  Let me just tell you a little of what to expect.<br />1) Expect more danger and emotion than the other books in the series.<br />2) Expect answers to your big questions, but some things left unsaid.<br />3) Expect a thoroughly satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />Advice:<br />1) Put aside preconcieved notions of what you think should happen and enjoy the ride.  I dragged in one or two expectations regarding plot and wish I had not.<br />2) Take the day off when you recieve the book in the mail b/c once you start it is really hard to put down.<br /><br />To say more would spoil your fun.  Enjoy!
