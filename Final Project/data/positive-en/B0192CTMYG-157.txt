I bought this book to help me learn Spanish.  I thought it would be more fun to read novels and watch Spanish TV soap operas (telenovelas) than to sit through classes and grind through textbooks. In addition to some study material and a dictionary, I bought 5,000 computer flashcards.  At first this novel in Spanish was difficult and I couldn't understand much; however, I've worked my way through all the flashcards and the novel is now easy.  It was the interactive flashcards (see my other reviews) that made the biggest difference.
