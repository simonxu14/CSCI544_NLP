This book is AMAZING!!! I knew it would be beautiful but when it arrived the illustrations blew me away! The pictures are beautiful drawn and colored and could easily be framed and hung on a wall, they are that good. And best of all- the book has kept my daughters' interest and so now they beg for me to read to them from it every night! Wonderful! I really love the red ribbon bookmark that is attached. It helps us keep out place and just adds to the beauty of the book. HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend!!
