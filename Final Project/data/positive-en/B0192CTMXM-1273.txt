Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is an absolute must for anyone who's read the first 6 books in the series. The Deathly Hallows takes you through Harry's last adventure to destroy the evil Lord Voldemort. J.K. Rowling does a wonderful job in tying up the story to a very satisfying ending I think all will be pleased with.
