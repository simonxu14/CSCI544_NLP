Don't be put off by all the hype--this truly is a great book. If it were possible to combine E. Nesbit, C.S. Lewis and Madeline D'Engle you might get something close to J. K. Rowling. But her astounding creativity and characters place her in a class by herself. She is the Tolstoy of children's literature. The only thing more enjoyable than reading Rowling's novel is listening to the audio version superbly narrated by Jim Dale. His reading is perfection--and the perfect way for families to "read" the book together. Highly reccommend all the unabridged Potter audio books performed by Jim Dale. This text refers to the unabridged audio version of the book.
