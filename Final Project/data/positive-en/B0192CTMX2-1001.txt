I already have the hardcover version of this. I've been a fan of Harry Potter for a while, and the books just keep getting bigger and bigger, but I don't mind. I have to say, though, the paperback version is definitely easier to hold. I'm trying to take it slow with reading it so I get everything, 'cause I read the hardcover version in one day when it came out, and now I think it's time to read it again, especially before the new movies come out. Hardcover books are nicer looking, but paperbacks are definitely more efficient. It's really just personal preference, and that's the main reason why I bought the paperback.
