The series is WONDERFUL!  I'm now ordering it in hardbacks so I can read them all over again, and they'll hold up better than paperbacks in the long run.  I received my books in less time than stated (made me very happy), but the box was not only open on the top, the bottom was open,and one of the end pieces was sticking out.  It's a wonder the books were still inside and hadn't fallen out somewhere.  Maybe a little more tape on the box next time??
