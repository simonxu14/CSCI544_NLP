I found the Deathly Hallows to be everything that I had been hoping for and more.  After having enjoyed the series from the beginning, I had many questions.  I feel satisfied.  Not only have my question been answered I do not feel the need to have a sequel.  I am satisfied.  Thank you Ms. Rowling for this amazing series.  I only hope that another author gets the world excited to read as you have with such a worthy story.  I have enjoyed the journey but I am sorry to say good bye to Harry.<br /><br />B.
