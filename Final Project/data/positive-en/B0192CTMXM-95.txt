I enjoyed reading the book very much, but I felt that things fell apart toward the end.  The climactic battle was pretty dull, the "death of an important character" was not really emotionally moving, and the plot just didn't seem to tie together in a satisfying way.  In particular, there were a number of things that I was expecting to happen which didn't: Shouldn't Neville have confronted his parent's killer at some point?  Shouldn't Fudge have gotten sacked?  Shouldn't Harry have used the two-way mirror to contact Sirius?  I don't know, I just felt kind of let-down by the ending, and it wasn't because of the "death of an important character."
