I received this item very quickly, and seeing as I'm with my husband in South Korea, that is a HUGE compliment. I've read all the books before and was very happy to get the chance to complete my own set. My only complaint would be that the pages looked slightly water damaged. They had a small sort of wavy look to them. To me thats not something to get mad about because a book is going to get worn anyways, but I know to some that may seem important to them. Overall I was very happy with my experience with Amazon and with this book.
