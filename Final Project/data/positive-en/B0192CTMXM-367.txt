This is the British paperback version of the book. I read it originally when it first came out in the US in hardcover, and have been on a recent Potter kick when rewatching the movies on ABC Family tv...came across this British import paperback and got it to re-read the book.<br /><br />As to this version - there are no internal illustrations like there are in the US hardcover, but it's great to have a lightweight version you can throw into a bag and go (I travel a lot). The binding is strong, the paper good quality, and so far, it's the only paperback version available.
