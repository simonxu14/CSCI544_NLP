Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets has been among my favorites of the Harry Potter books mostly due to the brilliance of the ending, it has a slightly darker tone than the first book, but it moves along a bit quicker as well. Much of the plot is concerned with the identity of the heir of Slytherin, which is revealed by the end of the book in the brilliant plot-within-a-plot-within-a-plot ending. There is some groundwork laid for later books in the series which is delightful to encounter as a reader. The &#34;Ah, so that's what that's about!&#34; moments later on are great, some of those moments are set in Chamber of Secrets. It's definitely a part of a series, but as a standalone book it does have its own built in beginning, middle, and end as well. (Most all the Potter Books have a relatively repetitive &#34;There and back again&#34; structure.)
