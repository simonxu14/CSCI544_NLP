Probably my favorite so far of the Harry Potter series (1-4 anyway!), PoA allows the audience to gain insight (along with Harry!) on what happened when You Know Who killed Harry's parents. The dreaded dementors flock to Hogwarts to search for the escaped Sirius Black, and cause Harry lots of problems; dementors thrive on human emotions, and cause Harry to re-live the events leading up to his parents murder whenever they get near him. Despite this, they give Harry (and the audience) a chance to learn more about himself.<br />Hermione is at her best in this book, overloading on classes, and stressing herself to bits. And if not for her, justice could not have been served!<br />We see a more emotional Ron, when something comes between him and his beloved Scabbers.<br />Quidditch! There's plenty of it in the PoA. I loved every minute of it!<br />And lastly, Sirius Black. I really enjoyed getting to know his character. It was a relief to find out that Harry has a guardian and confidant he can contact if he ever has any problems. Lord knows the Dursleys won't help him!<br />All in all, I found this book excellent--the characters all go through important developments, which will undoubtedly impact the following books. A superb effort by J.K. Rowling!
