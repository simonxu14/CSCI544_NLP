This is the Harry Potter book that moves the series firmly out of the realm of "children's fiction".  I enjoyed it immensely, but what I found the most interesting was the way that Rowling shaded many of the familiar black-and-white characters as a much more ambiguous grey.  The result is sometimes disconcerting.  Heroic Harry is now a sullen teen who often seems to be working at cross purposes with Dumbledore.  Snape, who you were never sure wasn't going to turn out to be the villain in the other books, takes a turn in a sympathetic light.  James Potter turns out to have had a mean streak; Sirius has some pretty serious character shortcomings; even Aunt Petunia seems to be hiding something.<br />Most striking is that the memorable nasty villain of this book is not Voldemort (either in his own body or someone else's) or his Death Eater cronies -- it is an overly officious, power-hungry, totalitarian bureaucrat.  In a fantasy world where Voldemort represents evil and Dumbledore, Hogwarts, &c. represents good, how can this be reconciled?  Rowling has introduced so much complexity of character with OOTP that it's like a whole new series.  Read it to enjoy the ambiguities.
