This was my first time buying audio books new but I was having such a hard time finding used ones in good condition that I broke down and bought new for a change. I'm so used to borrowing them from the libraries that finally have the full collection was really nice. It arrived much faster than I was expecting. Ever disc worked the was it was suppose to.
