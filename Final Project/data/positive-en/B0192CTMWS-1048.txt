The Deathly Hallows was everything I anticipated and more.  The story picks up after the dramatic climax of "The Half-Blood Prince" and hits the ground running.  Will Harry or Voldemort survive?  Did Dumbledore misplace his trust in Snape?  Who else will die?  All these questions and more are answered in this amazing conclusion to the Harry Potter series.  Ms. Rowling has saved her best for last and her personal evolution in her craft has never been more apparent.  This book is a necessity for anyone with the slightest interest in Harry Potter.
