Harry Potter and his friends are growing up and facing increasing challenges, not the least of which include the mysteries of a girl's mind.  The issues are darker and far more political. Friendships are a bit rockier and there are more secrets.  Harry finds out more about adults in his life - they are imperfect and make mistakes.  Once again, J.K, Rowling has written a tight, fast moving story, rich in detail and characterizations, with enough mystery and suspense to make it difficult to put down despite its 870 pages and 38 chapters.
