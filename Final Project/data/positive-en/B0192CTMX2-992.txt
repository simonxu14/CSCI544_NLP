How could anyone not LOVE this book??  If I've learned anything, JK Rowling is a stickler for detail.  I don't think anything that happened in this book was insignificant so it HAD to be as long as it was.  And if the ending wasn't a surprise it was because people sold it and read it before the release date!!!  I couldn't have been more angry that those people tried to spoil it for the rest of us.  Anyways, Harry is growing up and he's going through the same pains the typical teenager goes through - no one understands, angry at adults, trying to figure out the opposite sex.  And the plot thickens.  ^_^  When does the next one come out??
