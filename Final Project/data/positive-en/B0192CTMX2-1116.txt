Wonderfuls series of books and not just for children.  Great fantasy and adventures.  Love this series of books.  Sorry this was the last book that the author will be writing in this series. I'm thoroughly addicted to reading these books.  I will reread the series now that I have them all in the order that they were released and refresh my memories of times past spent enjoying perusing them.
