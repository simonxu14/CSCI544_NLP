Always love the Harry Potter series.  My gift was the beginning of her experience at HEARING it read by the amazing Mr. Dale.  In my view, the books came to life in a much different way from reading it myself.  A wonderful experience, that I'm glad to share.  She got the item and loved it.<br />thanks<br />s
