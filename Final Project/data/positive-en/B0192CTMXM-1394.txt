Great buy - I like how the book has a darker themed cover and is compressed into a smaller sized novel for a more adult look. Its nice to have as a copy that's smaller for carrying around in a book bag or something. The copies you usually find of HP in the children's section are either hardcover or large print (or both) and are sort of bulky and take up lots of space.<br /><br />For the same price as a children's copy this one's smaller and looks way cooler (IMO)
