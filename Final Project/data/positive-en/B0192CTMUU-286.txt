JK Rowling has done it again, bigger and better than ever before!  I absolutely DEVOURED this installment of the beloved Harry Potter series!  The new magical creatures were a delight to meet and the Triwizard  tournament was very well plotted and exciting.  This story may be a little  intense for younger readers (there are several deaths), but all in all, I  couldn't put it down.  The only disappointment is that we'll have to wait  anohter year to find out what happens next!
