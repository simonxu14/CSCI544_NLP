My 4yo is obsessed with Pokemon Go.  The characters are in ABC order and there are all Pokemon in there, not just Go ones.  Each Pokemon has a blurb about it's life, how to pronounce name, all the different battles it has and what they evolve into.  We've been reading a letter a night before bed.  Great quality book and my son loves it!
