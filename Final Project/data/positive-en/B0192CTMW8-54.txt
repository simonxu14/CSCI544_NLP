After watching the Harry Potter movies and reading all the books from the library, my 9 year old son wanted to own the series.  I was so happy that I could get him these books and it not cost me an arm and a leg! Very happy with the purchase and I will be purchasing the rest of the series from this vendor.  In fact, I will be purchasing all my books from them.
