Like any first book of a series it usually is the hardest to get into, due to the fact that you know little to nothing about the book. This was the hardest book to read of the series, even after seeing the movie and then reading the book. But it is not the best book of the series but I can't say it is the worst either. I don't think any of the books can be labled 'worst'. This book and the second book hold unique places within the series, for everything is being build on these two and the ball starts rolling in the third book (The best of the series, along with the Goblet of Fire), the ball is rolling and we know the characters and we know what to expect at times, but at the sametime she keeps up suspensful as to what really is going to happen and keeps us in the dark about the next book.<br /><br />This book is an introduction to the characters, like meeting anyone for the first time it takes a little while to get acquainted, this is why I think book three is the best, we are fully acquainted and they are good friends.<br /><br />But nonetheless, this is a good book and better to read the second time.
