This book has the potential of being the Greatest book ever. I read the book everyday after work. I think that The Goblet of Fire is my all time favorite so far in the series.The non-stop action and adventure kept my  eves glued to the pages, when I finished I was wanting 200 or more pages. I  did not want the book to end. I am telling all my friends!. You can not  enjoy reading any more than reading the stories about Harry Potter and all  his friends. I can not wait for Book 5! .
