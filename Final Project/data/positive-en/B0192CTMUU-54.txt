I was introduced to the Harry Potter series when a relative suggested I listen to the TAPES before reading the books. In retrospect I think this is was VERY sound advice!<br />I would highly recommend others to do the same. A first time visitor to the series may become frustrated very quickly with the pronunciation of the various names and places, whereas listening to the tapes eliminates that chore completely and allows you to sit back and enjoy Jim Dale's incredible talent.<br />Don't think of this as a book-on-tapes series. Think of it as a one man show! Jim Dale performs over 125 voices with amazing skill, and recalls each and every one with ease throughout the entire series...The &quot;Hagrid&quot; you meet on the _Sorcerer's Stone_ tapes is the same "Hagrid" you revisit on the _Goblet Of Fire_ tapes.<br />Definitely worth the price...Just be sure to preview it before letting the kids listen to them. Jim Dale has a very pleasant and entertaining voice but this particular book is rather dark and scary.<br />Why only Four stars? Because of profanities in the beginning (One character says : "...No one at the bank gives a  d---  how I dress as long as I bring home plenty of treasure"...it is written on page 62 of the book). Why make a big deal out of it when it only appears once in the entire 800+ pages? Because in MY book once is too much.<br />Listen, I know people speak like this on a normal basis in the real world, but this is supposed to be a kid`s book.  J.K. Rowling has many adult fans also, but we are not the target market.<br />Just my opinion.<br />Cris
