I've been meaning to read this for years. It did not disappoint,  even though I've seen bits of the movies. The characters are strong and clearly good or bad, a little predictable, in a children's book kind of way. The dialogue is great. The plot was strong and it's all very atmospheric. A dream world for those who like magic stories, well told.
