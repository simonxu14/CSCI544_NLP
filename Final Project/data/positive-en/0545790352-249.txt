The illustrations are amazing, high quality pages and totally worth the price.<br />I almost bought this at full price elsewhere but instead bought it here on Amazon for about $25, but it is worth the $40 price tag!<br />The pages are nice and thick, the images are nice and lovely to look at, I spent some time flipping through to look at them all.<br />I love that there is a ribbon place marker as well.<br />I haven't read this book since it came out nearly 20 years ago and I couldn't imagine a better way to reread it!
