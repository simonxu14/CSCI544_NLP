J.K. Rowling triumphantly closes the Harry Potter series in "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows." I bought the first one for my son when he was eleven years old. He loved it and I then read it to see for myself what the big deal was. During the past eight years, my son and I have continued read and enjoy the books. I am especially grateful to Rowling because she gave us something to talk about during the teenage years. My son will be a junior in college this year and we are both thrilled to see that # 7 is one of the best. Rowling did a fantastic job in creating a suspenseful, dramatic, and best of all, a satisfying ending to the series. I am impressed with how Harry, the other characters, and the story-line matured with each edition. From the first installment which was a kid's book to the mostly adult fantasy story in Deathly Hallows, the Harry Potter series is a true coming of age saga. Rowling has a prolific imagination and a breezy, but thoughtful writing style that prevented the staleness and repetition that usually occurs in a series based on a single character or theme. Harry Potter and his friends are now almost grown-up and appropriately, Deathly Hallows is not a little kid's book. The plot is complex and dark and a little disturbing at times, but this should be expected when the subject becomes the "real" Magical world in which decency and good are at stake. I hope that she will continue writing of this world in a new series. I would enjoy reading her future works along with any grandchildren that come along someday. In the meantime, Rowling has created something that will be beloved for a long time.
