We got this for my father-in-law, who has studied Arabic for the last 4 years or so. He was very amused, and thinks he should be able to read it in a few years. By the end of his birthday weekend, he said he'd been able to translate "parts of a few sentences on the first page." Anyway, it's a nicely printed and bound book, and fun for an Arabic reader.
