My husband and I are in our forties, and we LOVED listening to the first Harry Potter on audiotape, read by Jim Dale (a British actor). He did an incredible job, keeping all the characters quite individual and  recognizable. We look forward to hearing all the books. I want to own the  books in the print version, but I've heard so much about differences in the  British and American versions that I don't know if it changes the content.  I might want the originals - but I don't know enough to make a decision.
