I received the book and I love it and so does my son.  I was reading my Kindle version to my son and he always asked if there was a picture he also seems to connect better with a book to hold.  I decided to buy this for him because I want to him fall in love with Harry Potter as much as I did.  The book is beautifully illustrated and it is the full book.  My son loves it and loves being able to see a picture of what is happening and to see a face that goes with the characters in the book.  I definitely recommend this book.
