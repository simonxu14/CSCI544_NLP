Jim Dale does a fun and incredible job as narrator of the Harry Potter books.  After listening to Sorcerer's Stone I immediately picked up the rest of the series.  I admire how he comes up with different accents for the many characters.  I even ordered the UK version from ..., and nice as those are, I think Jim Dale's version takes the cake - or pumpkin pasties!
