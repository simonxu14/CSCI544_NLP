This was actually the second time I'd read Book One. I read it when it first came out. It was still very entertaining, even years later. I was never bored, not once, and even though I knew what was going to happen, it was so much like visiting with old friends, that didn't bother me.<br /><br />My only complaint, and it is minor, is that some of the writing is a bit awkward. Ms. Rowling got much better as the series ran on, but her early efforts were a tad amateurish.<br /><br />All that aside, Ms. Rowling deserves the accolades she's received. The POTTER series is a massive accomplishment, highly entertaining, incredibly creative, and a whole lot of fun!
