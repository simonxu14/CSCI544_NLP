Harry Potter is a fantastic Fantasy/Science Fiction series. (If you didn't already know this, you must have been under a rock all of your life). If you haven't read these books, don't wait a second longer. READ THEM! They're absolutely wonderful. Rowling's writing style quickly enraptures and draws you into the story, and each book will only leave you dying to find out what happens next.
