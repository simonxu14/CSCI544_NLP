Don't get me wrong, but the book, although brilliant, leaves me yearning for a bit more....and sad at the loss of some of my favorite characters including Mr. Snape. Then again, I am a bit sad that its come to the end.<br /><br />The epilogue did not complete my need to know the end. What of McGonagell, Hagrid, The Weasleys, and the Longbottoms. Who took over Hogwarts? What became of the house elves and others that joined the fight.<br /><br />I almost believe one could write and eight book to complete the lives of those we have come to know as old friends, heros and villians.<br /><br />I must admit, I am thankful for how it ended, that the true heros were those we least suspected or dared to believe were true. That Severas was proven a hero and so many others found strength and unexpected courage proved that it was not Harry alone that could win the battle, but a community of people who as friends and believers worked together to conquer evil...maybe we should take a look at this and think about how in our own lives we can take a stand to make the world a better place.
