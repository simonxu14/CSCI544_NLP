Harry might not be in this story but that doesn't matter because the magic is still beautiful. Great new characters, story, and of course the fantastic beasts themselves!<br /><br />This is a script book like the Cursed Child so don't assume it's a regular novel like the original seven books.<br /><br />Can't wait to see how the story continues with the next four films.
