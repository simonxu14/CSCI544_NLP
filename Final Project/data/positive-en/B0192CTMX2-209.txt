About how I bought the softcover versions of these book because I didn't want to ruin the first edition ones I have... That's how much I love Harry Potter. I've purchased every book with the exception of the first one the day it came out and I still remember seeing the first book at the fall book fair when I was in 2nd grade and begging my mom who was running it to buy it for me. That being said the 3rd book isn't my favorite book but it introduces my favorite character in the series.
