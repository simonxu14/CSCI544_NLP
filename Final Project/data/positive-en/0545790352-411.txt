First of all, just let me say this book is really nice. It is both bigger and heavier then I thought it would be. Most of us at this point have read the The Sorcerer's Stone so you know the story so I won't comment on that. The illustrations in this book are beautiful and I was blown away at their detail. Not every page is filled with illustrations as I first thought they would be, but there are enough illustrations that you in no way feel cheated in spending the money on yet another copy of a Harry Potter book.This book would have been worth the $40 cover price, but it's an extremely good deal at the Amazon $23 price point. I love these books and I can't wait to see the illustrations for the next 6.
