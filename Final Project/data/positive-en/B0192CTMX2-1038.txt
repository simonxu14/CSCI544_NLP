J.K. Rowling had a formidable task ahead of her when she wrote the final chapter in the Harry Potter saga. Was it possible to write an ending that would satisfy everyone or would she endure the wrath of her dedicated legions of fans? Probably not, but I think she came as close as she possibly could. Like many readers, I wished we had spent more time with certain tertiary characters we have come to know and love and a few plot developments felt somewhat contrived. That said, Book 7 was a thrilling read which drew me in and captivated me for its duration.
