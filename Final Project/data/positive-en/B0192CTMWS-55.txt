This book rocks and rolls... hard! It starts off in the usual manner with scenes of Harry with the Dursleys. But then everything else seems slightly different when compared to the other HP books! This book seems to reflect upon the fact that Harry is now older than he was in the earlier books. The characters that one is going to meet in this book are the usual Hogwarts crew and also Lupin, Sirius, Moody, The Weasleys amongst others make their appearance in it. There is also a new DADA teacher who is positively REPULSIVE. I hated reading about what she did and tried to do! It was positively loathsome! In fact, believe me when I say this: She was positively more repulsive than Voldermort ever could be! Be prepared to hate her the most when you embark upon the "O.T.Phoenix". There are also a couple of new creatures: Threstals! I will not tell you what they are, only that they are interesting! And, as far as the character that dies is concerned. You'll keep guessing who it is till the very end! On at least four different occasions, I thought sadly that the time had come, but then it didn't. But when it comes, you're sad anyway! The only thing which I felt was lacking in this book was that Draco Malfoy's role in it seems to have dwindled! He hardly ever appears in this book.<br />But on the whole: this book does live up to the hype surrounding it and the secrecy behind the whole business of "Who dies in it?" is also intriguing. A new witch called Tonks is introduced in this book; she sounds like real fun! ;) Anyway, to sum it all up in a succinct statement: The book is absolutely riveting and enjoyable. The only thing is that now we'll have to wait till HP-6 comes out! That will be an agony filled wait. Till then, HP-5 will have to do. And it will...
