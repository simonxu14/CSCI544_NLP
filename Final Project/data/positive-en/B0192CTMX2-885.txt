I've been a Harry Potter fan for years now and anxiously looked forward to the Order of the Phoenix.  I was not disappointed!  While the beginning of the book seemed to drag with the constant angst of Harry I later found it was needed to set us up for the excitement of the last 300 pages.  It was like being on a wild rollercoaster ride and when I was finished, I could have kicked myself for reading it so fast.  I'm going to have to wait that much longer for the next book that is bound to be even better now that more people believe He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back.  This book is definitely less light hearted than the earlier Potter books.  There are more mature themes, but they are handled in such a way that they are not really inappropriate for a younger audience. I highly recommend this book for a wide age range.
