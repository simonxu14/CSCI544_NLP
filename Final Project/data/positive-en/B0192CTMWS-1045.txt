I am 27 yrs of age, and I along with many other adults are fascinated with the books of Harry Potter.. Of all of the books in the series this one by far is the best!This book was very hard to put down, and never a dull moment for being almost 900 pages..But don't let that deter anyone from reading this because so much happens and you will become so enthralled that you won't even realize how long it is.I was soo disappointed when I finished with the book because I just wanted to keep reading more and more into the world of Hogwards and Harry Potter.
