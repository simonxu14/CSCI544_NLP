What else can I say that hasn't already been said?<br />I've loved the movies for a long time so it was time for me to read the books.<br />Now before I get scoffed at for being a movie fan before a book fan let me explain why I prefer it this way:<br />I get to enjoy the whole movies without feeling like anything is missing. Then I got to read the books and learn SO MUCH more!<br />Ok, I do wish Peeves had been included in the movies. Haha
