I was not in the least bit disappointed with this latest installment in the Harry Potter series.  In fact, it might be my new favorite.  Absolutely couldn't put it down.  I love Harry's new teenager attitude, and lots of questions were answered, leaving the story open for more interesting twists and turns in the future.<br />Only downside--I don't know how I'll wait for the next one.
