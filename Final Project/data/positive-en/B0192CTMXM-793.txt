Finally, Hogwarts lives up to its name. Harry has settled himself to the task of ridding the world of Lord Voldemort and in the process found his true love, Ginny Weasley. Hermione and Ron realize that they truely in love with each other. In the final confrontation, the Hogwarts students live up to their training and bravely take on Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. The only suprise to this was the death of some of the characters who had a lot to do with Harry's growth. The action was fast,  hot and furious, and really struck home in the imagination. One could almost visualize the fight scenes. The loss of both Professor Lupin and Tonks, so shortly after their marriage and the birth of their child was totally unexpected. Couple that with the death of Fred Weasley, instead of Percy, seemed a terrible loss to the story. The ending of the story was almost as if the story was about to start all over again with another lonely child. Still, J.K. Rowling saved her best for last and it really comes out.
