I LOVE HARRY POTTER!  So, this is the last book of harry potter :(((. It's sad that it's the last book but, this book was great! It tells you everything you need to know. It answers soo many questions. If you love harry potter you need to get this book. I got the hard cover because I don't like the paper back books I don't like the lines it makes on the spine. I bought the book online on pottermore last year for my birthday and I just finished reading the whole book today it took me a year but I finished it again, last time I read it, it was back in 2009 so of course I didn't really remember much until I started to read the book again. I bought the hard cover book for my birthday this year which was this month and thought it was a nice birthday present since I love Harry potter. I still have to buy again the 2,3, and 6th boo. And of course read it again. So like I said if you've read the other sixth books you have to read the last book. Like everyone says &#34; the books are always better then the movies&#34; and it is soo true. Happy reading!
