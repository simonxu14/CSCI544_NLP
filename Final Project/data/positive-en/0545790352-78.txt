This is great. I like the illustrations. It has enough illustrations that your kids who are familiar with the story (but maybe not old enough to read it on their own) can flip through and know what's going on. My one complaint is how every page has blotches and other colors on it to give the page texture or make it look like an older manuscript. I wish they'd just print the words and leave the background alone.
