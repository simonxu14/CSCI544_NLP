J. K. Rowling has created another wonderful book in her Harry Potter series with Goblet of Fire.  As Harry and friends have matured so have the plot lines and the tension and suspense underlying them.  I'm not sure how  the latest book will play with young children, but as an adult admirer of  Harry, I could not put it down.  As his 4th year at Hogwarts begins, Harry  is confronting more danger from without and changes from within.  But Ms.  Rowling never descends into tiresome teenage angst as Harry and friends  face danger and their own changing attitudes towards one another.  And the  laugh out loud moments appear often to break the increasing  tension.<br />People wonder why Harry Potter has become the phenomenom it is.  The most basic reason and the one most often overlooked is that J. K.  Rowling is a fabulous writer!
