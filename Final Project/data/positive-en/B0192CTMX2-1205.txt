I think that this last book of the Harry Potter series is by far the best of all the books. This will make a great movie, she is so creative, and wraps up the questions left in the other books really well. It's a fun and exciting adventure she puts Harry and his friends through!! I highly recommend the book to anyone who is a Harry Potter or fantasy fan!! Read it you'll love it!!
