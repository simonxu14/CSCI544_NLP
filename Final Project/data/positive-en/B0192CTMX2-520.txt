This book is simply Harry Potter meets the Godfather. Unlike many or most children's books, there are a lot of hurt and dead people between pages. And, that may be the reason why I liked this book more than the six previous publications.<br /><br />Also, Potter fans know the nuances.  They have become accustomed to Rowling's great language among the wizards (Is there a greater term than "muggle?") .  With familiarity comes comfort, with comfort comes enjoyment. In turn, the greater the familiarity bestows greater enjoyment.<br /><br />Now, one would think I am implying that her formula was simple:  Just write more and be more appreciated.  Actually, this book could have bombed.  Pottermaniacs have such great expectations - which makes each book more difficult.  You have heard of television wearing out a concept - they call it "Jump the Shark."  I am sure Rowling and her publishers were sincerely concerned about Book 7 "jumping the shark." I guarantee you that this book did not come close to jumping the shark - in fact the opposite is true.  Some disgruntled readers deplore the ending's epilogue "Nineteen Years Later." This may be legitimate. Rowling  infuriated fans.  Why? Because we must grow up and realize that the epilogue leads readers to the logical conclusion that Harry Potter books have come to a close. Ouch.  They did not end because of "jump the shark" reasons.  This veteran player did not leave the game after its prime.  This series ended in aplomb. Rowling, like a great player, hit a home run her last at bat with Harry Potter.<br /><br />This is a great year for Potter.  Book 5,  "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", was for may their least popular book - but was one of the better films among the five thus far produced.  And, this book is overwhelmingly a Pottermaniac's favorite.<br /><br />And, it seems that Rowling's writing style has matured.  Vocabulary seems stronger.  Some of the verse is flavorful. She starts right off with Doyle-like description of English manor gardens: "The high hedge curved with them, running off into the distance beyond the pair of impressive wrought-iron gates barring the men's ways. . . Gravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape and Yaxley sped toward the door. . ." She is underestimated in her writing skills and overly presumed to be thriving only from her imaginative plots.  Oh do not be fooled - this is a really talented writer - stylistically as well as content.<br /><br />After reading these books, one must wonder about Rowling The above-cited verse is strong. The dialogue is strong, and the concepts are "out of this world." .  For most Pottermaniacs, she is their most read writer. The seven books total more than 3,868 pages (American Publications) [respectively 259, 256, 320, 752, 870, 652, and 769 pages]. That is a tremendous number of pages to read from three or more authors. But, Rowling has awed us to not only read, but buy the hardbacks en masse - on the date of release!!<br /><br />Pottermania is more than mania - it is a phenomenon. And, Rowling should be heralded for it. She changed the rules for NY Times' Best Seller's List  - after having 3 or 4 books on the list for period exceeding one year, the rules changed to exclude children's books forever from that list.<br /><br />For those who are younger than I am - my children are deemed too old for Harry - I offer some advice of those you may want to read, based upon concepts within her books.<br /><br />If you like the plots and nuances of the issues: pull out Doyle's "Sherlock Holmes" series at the library. Also, Dan Brown's "Da Vinci Code" or Deception Point" may give you further intrigue.<br /><br />If you liked the suspense, and enjoyed the mild gore - look to America's unique venue of mystery gumshoe novels by Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, Micky Spillane, John MacDonald, and James Ellroy among so many others.<br /><br />If you likes the concepts of speaking to the dead and out-of-body experiences, try Philip K. Dick, Stephen King (his books are equally long), or Tony Vigorito.<br /><br />If you are a science fiction lover, try the "Dune" series by Frank Herbert and his writing heirs, Isaac Asmiov or Edgar Rice Burroughs.<br /><br />If those names are new to you, great. If you are familiar with those names, you would know that I am putting Rowling in company with writers of great fame and who have all won awards (Dick actually has an award named after him).<br /><br />Don't be surprised if an award is named after this writer in the near future.
