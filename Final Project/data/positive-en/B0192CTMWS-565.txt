I love this book, but at the same time I hate it, because it's the end to one of the best series written in this generation. The Deathly Hallows has a wonderful story but it's not flawless.  Throughout the plot twists towards the end, it feels a bit rushed, and a bit confusing (over the ownership of the elder wand). Nevertheless it's still a great book to have, and I would suggest this book to anyone who is a fan of the genre (and maybe even if you're not).
