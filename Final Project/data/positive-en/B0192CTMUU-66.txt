I LOVED this book. I have read it about six times and it still doesn't get boring. I think J.K. is getting better and better. The book is long-but it only took me two days to read it. I'd rather the book be long though, because I don't ever want it to finish!!! The plot is really good and it is impossible to desert the book when you're up to the last 100 pages. I missed cheerleading practice because of those last 100 pages lol. I would advise EVERYONE to read this book.
