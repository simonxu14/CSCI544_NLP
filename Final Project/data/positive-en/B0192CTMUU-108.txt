I am 25, but never read any of the books or saw any of the movies until this year, so now I'm binge-reading/watching the whole series. There were some parts that really seemed to drag and all of Hermione's drama was super annoying. Overall though, this has been my favorite book of the series so far (though I'm only a quarter of the way through book 5 right now). Definitely worth the read. So far none of the movies have been any substitute for reading the books.
