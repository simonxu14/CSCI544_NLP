This book is an absolutely great purchase. It is well written and a great choice for all ages in my opinion. The hardcover purchase is a great buy as well. If you stuck between choosing to buy paperback or hardcover go hardcover. Unless you are going to be truly gentle with the book, always go harcover. Because paperback books, especially for this series it seems, to rip apart really easily. Hardcover on the other hand are still in great condition, for my part at least. So go ahead and buy the book, its worth it!
