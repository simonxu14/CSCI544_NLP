I bought the paperback edition because I had been curious about a children's book that adults wanted to read. I was more than pleasantly  surprised. Ms. Rowling has put together a very well constructed, thoroughly  absorbing, and what is really to the point, a tale that delights,  surprises, and thoroughly entertains the reader, even one who has been  reading for far more years than most of the purchasers of the book have  been alive.<br />To those who condemn the book because it allegedly promotes  necromancy, nihilism, and other nefarious practices I can only say that I  respect your opinion but beg to differ. This is a work of fantasy designed  to entertain. Many (very young) readers have been quoted as understanding  fully the difference between fantasy and reality.<br />If you've been thinking  about getting it -- stop thinking and add it to your cart. You're in for a  delightful few hours.
