I started reading this book on Saturday and came in to work bleary-eyed on Monday because I just couldn't put it down---and I'm already anxious to get to number 5.  The story is both engrossing and amusing. This book is more  complex and suspenseful than the earlier ones; the author seems to trust  that her child readers are maturing along with Harry and his friends.  She  introduces some entertaining new characters, such as the delightfully  detestable Rita Skeeter and the wizard Mad-Eye, while continuing to develop  Harry, Hermione, Ron, and the rest of the familiar cast.  I consider these  books to be the equivalent of the Oz series or the Chronicles of Narnia.  I  highly recommend this title not only to the children for whom it's written  but to adults like me as well!
