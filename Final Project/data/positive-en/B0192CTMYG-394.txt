I had been looking for these CDs for a long time (here in Italy you can't find them). The book is awesome and really well written and I couldn't wait to hear it narrated by the great voice of Jim Dale. Simply beautiful, this Anniversary Edition Audio Book is suitable for every age. The box contains 7 CDs, divided in two sets, all with colorful illustrations.<br />Buy it, do not hesitate, you won't regret!
