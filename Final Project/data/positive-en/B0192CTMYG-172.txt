It took me a long time to choose reading this first Harry Potter book. My primary hesitation was that it is a children&#8217;s book and I wasn't sure if I wanted to invest the time. I was also concerned about all the attention to its&#8217; occult references.<br />Having finished reading it, I can honestly say that this is a really sweet, compelling story and a pleasant read. Rowling has done a fine job of building a story in the Roald Dahl mode. You know where &#8220;certain&#8221; adults are simply irredeemably cruel, countered by a truly innocent character. In this case, an innocent Harry Potter is counterbalanced against his cruel Aunt, Uncle and cousin.<br />As I said, like Dahl&#8217;s characters, Harry is simply a victim of circumstances but his true character is intact, strong and courageous. There is a confidence about him that seems to give him strength. Like all escapist fantasy, this story just seems to strike a common chord with so many people. I liked it a great deal. Additionally, I think the author does a really good job of introducing us to this otherworldly place of wizards and witches since Harry learns along with us.<br />That being said, and as a Christian, I found constant references to witchcraft, spells and dark magic to be really bothersome. I can accept it as a plot device for the foundation of a fantasy book. The witchcraft and wizardry in this book is similar to that made-for-television witchcraft, in so much that some people have inherited magic genetically while others do not in the variety of Darren and Samantha Stevens. This sort of witchcraft simply doesn&#8217;t exist in reality. Real witchcraft is dark and sad. I am concerned that undiscerning kids would take their fascination with the story and explore the real thing.<br />With all that in mind, I would have loved this series when I was a kid. I&#8217;ll allow my children to read it when they can discern (they&#8217;re too young to read now anyway). I would suggest that parents read it too. I think it's important to be involved in your kids&#8217; activities and this is certainly a very quick read.<br />People who criticize this series for occult content based on presuppositions without reading it should be ashamed. It is a good piece of work and not worth the negative attention. Though Rowling is probably experiencing the truth of the phrase, &#8220;There is no such thing as bad publicity.&#8221; I&#8217;ll look forward to the movies.
