I had never read these books before--they came out when I was a kid, but I thought I was too good for them with my Animal Farm and my Brave New World. How wrong I was!<br /><br />I am only giving this four stars because I ordered a paperback copy--which I've since double- and triple-checked, and the order DEFINITELY said &#34;paperback&#34;--and I got a hardback. I know that seems like a totally stupid complaint, but hear me out: I am a tiny lady, and I like smaller books that I can easily bend with my child-sized claws I like to call hands. I like my books to be easily taken into the tub. In the two days it took me to finish this one, I spent a majority of my reading sitting at my kitchen table, which was kind of irritating and cold, but dammit I wanted to finish this damn book.<br /><br />I just like paperbacks, and now all my copies don't match =/ but I feel silly because I paid paperback price so I really shouldn't complain.
