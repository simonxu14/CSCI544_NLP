This is a beautiful book! I first saw this at universal studios in the store at the hog warts castle. It was so gorgeous. The employee there told me that they sold it at the same price as everywhere else because the price was controlled by scholastic. I almost bought it there, but decided to look on Amazon on the off chance it was here. And I am so glad that I did, because it was almost half the price here! I have recieved the book and it is truly gorgeous and I can't wait to begin reading it with my son. I will definately be purchasing the other books when they are released in illustrated format! Thank you!
