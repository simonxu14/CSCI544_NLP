This book was difficult to read, I didn't want the series to end and that flavoured by reading. I enjoyed every page and found myself (once again) laughing with the characters, crying w/ pivotal losses, and feeling satisfied at the book's end.<br /><br />JKR has done a fantastic job of getting in the characters' heads and conveying the teenaged angst regarding schoolwork, friendship, relationships, fears, and love. This book was more young adult leaning in some passages, but the characters are now young men and women and felt appropriate---they've grown and so their banter and train of thought has.<br /><br />I was despondent with certain deaths and found myself having to stop reading momentarily and then hungrily go back to the book. I know that JKR has been criticized for her writing, but I think those criticisms are unfair. For instance, her use of adverbs and the criticism stemming from this is really unwarranted. I think that the critics have not closely read the book and realized that JKR is writing in the voice of a tween or teenager and they often are melodramtic and flower their conversations with adverbs. Everything is so intense to them, remember!<br /><br />I wish there was someway for JKR to write more in this series, prequels?
