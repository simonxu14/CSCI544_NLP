This book is great. I read and read till my eyes were red.  Herminone is better than ever. Clever, brilliant, and psychologically acute! Makes Dr. Phil look like the charlatan he is. As for Harry, what's to be said?  He's still the star. But the new character, Luna Lovegood, appears to be ready to assume a key role in 6 & 7.  She not only understands Harry better than anyone (save, perhaps, Herminone), she shares a common childhood loss.  As for Cho Chang, well, looks aren't everything.  In terms of quirky character and brilliance, she can't hold a candle to either Hermione or Luna.  I like this book.  I like the contrast between Harry's wizarding virtuosity and dating cluelessness.
