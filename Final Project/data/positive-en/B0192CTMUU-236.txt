This is a great 4th book from J.K. Rowling, and continues theHarry Potter series in fine form. I have enjoyed all the Harry Potterbooks and this one did not let me down.<br />If you haven't read anything about this book yet (and you'd really have to be hiding under a rock not to have heard about Harry!), know that it is a bit darker in tone than the earlier books.  Realize, however, that Harry is getting older and in life, sometimes things get more complex as you get more life experience. J.K. Rowling has captured the essence of &quot;growing up&quot; in her books, and kids of all ages should relate to that.<br />Thanks for reading this review, and thank you, J.K. Rowling, for writing such a marvelous series.
