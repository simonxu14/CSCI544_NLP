With all of the reprints of the Harry Potter series (paperback, new cover art, movie pictures, etc), we were trying to complete our collection of the original hard back books. We didn't start buying these for our collection until book #5 when the series had gained such a huge following. We were so glad we could find these individually here on Amazon to get the missing ones.<br /><br />The Goblet of Fire really turned up the action and intensity of the series. The first three were all fun and enjoyable as they created a magical world. However, book four seemed to be the first that introduced the overall conflict in a more direct way and was &#34;book one&#34; of the conflict with He Who Must Not Be Named that would end in The Deathly Hallows. Even if you've seen the movies, the books are deserving of a read. The cliche that the books are always better than the movies holds very true here. We hope that JK Rowling continues to write for many years and that she can create other worlds that are equally as imaginative and engaging as this one. Thanks for a great ride!
