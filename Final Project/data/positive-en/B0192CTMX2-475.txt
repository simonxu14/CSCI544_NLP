A fitting end to a wonderful adventure. I'm sure I'm joined by many in wanting more. Maybe pre-books ~~stories of the years James, Lilly, Sirius, Remus, and Severus roamed the halls and grounds of Hogwarts. Maybe a post~~ book telling of the adventures of the next generation of Hogwarts students and their parents. But if there is never another, we can read and re-read these Harry Potter books, as they will never lose their magic and will probably reveal something new with each reading.
