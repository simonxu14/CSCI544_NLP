So far, I have enjoyed this audio book immensely.  JK Rowling and Jim Dale are an inspired team.  However, I haven't gotten very far, because I am about to return my second set of tapes for serious tape malfunction.  At least two tapes in each set of twelve that I have purchased were visibly twisted and bent and no whizardry could get them to function.  Too bad.  Bet the rest of the tapes are just as good in content and performance.
