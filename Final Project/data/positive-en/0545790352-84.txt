As a huge Harry Potter fan, I was nothing short of busting a nut when thinking about reading the new illustrated version of HP and The Sorcerer's Stone. I am a visual person and I could not wait for a new and enhanced experience of reading a favorite book. However, I did have some small doubt because the last time I read this particular novel I was still in my teenage years. Now that I am 26 years old, I was apprehensive because I did not know how I would feel reading a story about an 11 year old wizard.<br /><br />During the first half of the novel, my worst nightmares as a Potter fan had become a reality. I was not enjoying the book as I had so many times during my youth. The story felt very juvenile and on top of that, the illustrations, although beautiful, were not adding anything new to my reading experience.<br /><br />That was until I began to read the chapter The Mirror of Erised. In this chapter there is a full page illustration of Harry looking into the mirror and I am not going to lie...it was absolutely heartbreaking. I do not get emotional very much when reading novels, but this stirred something inside of me to the point that tears began to well into my eyes. I even became emotional talking about it in my video review : https://youtu.be/cdcP_fIFbcM<br /><br />After that point, my worries faded and the story blossomed from an 11 year old wizard's rags to riches story to a tale of triumph, maturity, and friendship.<br /><br />I never thought that I could love Harry Potter more, but after reading the novel (an illustrated one at that!) again as an adult has only strengthened my adoration and love for J.K. Rowling and her Harry Potter novels.
