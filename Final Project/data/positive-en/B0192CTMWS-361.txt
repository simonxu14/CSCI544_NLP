I read all seven books to my grandsons while they were growing up with Harry.  I actually read all of them twice, as I read ahead for myself and then read to them.  Rowling is an enviable writer with am amazing imagination which she uses in conjuntion with an educated mind from which she extrapolates names, situations, etc. in the lives of Harry, Hermione, and Ron.  I loved my journeys into that alternate universe, imagining that I, too, was living under the stairs, visiting Hagrid, learning from Dumbledore, and facing all the dangers and adventures this trio and their peers faced.  I don't think there will be the like of this series for another few lifetimes.<br />Ah, Hogwarts!  I miss you.  Wish I could be an auror!
