We love Harry Potter! I read this book shortly after it came out. Honestly, through the first chapter, I just wasn't interested. I was encouraged to keep reading and couldn't put it down! The downside was having to wait for the next one. Now, my children are reading them and are developing the same love. This is definitely one worth having in your collection.
