First off, I loved the book. I roared through it for most of Saturday. This is not a young child's book. The darkness that people noticed in &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; is even more pronounced in &quot;Goblet of  Fire.&quot; In tone, this series reminds me a lot of Susan Cooper's  &quot;Dark is Rising&quot; books but  with a good deal of levening humor. I  was actually surprised at how well &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; hung together  since it logically divides into two major  parts - the World Quidditch Cup  and the fourth year at Hogwarts. I am also amazed and impressed at how  consistent the main characters (Harry, Ron, and Hermione) remain, while  continuing to grow into adulthood (wizardhood?). There are some great  new  characters too(I really liked Krum and Moody) as well as all the old  favorites. In fact, one of the few complaints I have is juggling all of the  new characters' stories  made the middle of the book a little diffuse. I  could have done without the Bagman subplot, although I expect it sets up  something for later. On the other hand, Neville's parents' story really  floored me. Poor kid. And Harry's ordeal at the end of the book is  incredibly intense. Which brings me to my final complaint. DO YOU MEAN I  HAVE TO WAIT A WHOLE YEAR  TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
