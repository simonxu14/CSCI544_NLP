I remember standing in line at our local Barnes & Noble with my daughter, Lauren on July 21st, 2007 waiting for midnight to arrive so we could buy Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows! We were so excited to find out how our favorite story was going to end. Needless to say we were not disappointed. I'm now reading these books to my granddaughter, Rachel and we are having so much fun. I recently order the entire boxed set for her so she could have her own copies. These books have now touched 3 generations of our family. Thank you JK Rowling for bringing us hours of delightful reading and a way for us to spend precious time together and start family traditions of reading together.
