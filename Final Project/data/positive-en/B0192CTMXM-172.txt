Very enjoyable. Carries on the story of Harry Potter whose battle against evil sees him joining a band of people intent on stopping Voldemort despite the larger wizard community denying Voldemort's return. As the government of the wizard community clamps down on all talk of the Dark Lord's return the interference spreads even into Hogwarts and Harry must endure the suspicion of having made everything up. Meanwhile the Dark Lord's quest for a secret weapon causes great concern for the Order of the Phoenix and Harry again must prove himself.
