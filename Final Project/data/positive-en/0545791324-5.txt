I absolutely love this.<br />The illustrations bring a whole new depth to the books.<br />Watching the movies and reading the books are completely different and the illustrations bring the parts that WEREN'T in the movies a live. I can not wait for the rest of the series to be illustrated.<br /><br />This is something that I can see reading to my future kids as it is more engaging than just text on a screen.<br /><br />The book itself feels sturdy and is definitely a piece of art. The pages have a nice glossy finish and are thick. Underneath the cover is a beautiful orange book with gold lettering.<br /><br />This book has a forever place on my book shelf.
