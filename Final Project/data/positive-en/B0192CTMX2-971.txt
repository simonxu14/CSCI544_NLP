I cannot rate any book in this series less than five stars, but I must confess to being somewhat disappointed with this book; not that it isn't superbly written -- it is -- but as it continues the pattern of the books getting somewhat darker as we get farther into the series, it was just a bit too depressing for my taste. I understand the reasoning behind the pattern, and appreciate the necessity of there being real losses to underscore the truly dire nature of the threat facing Harry & company. But I don't have to like it, and I don't. It doesn't keep me from appreciating the story, but I miss the somewhat more triumphant nature of the triumphs in the earlier books.
