When I started reading this series it was just to find out what all the hype was about.  One chapter into it and I was hooked.  This is the best series I have read.  I was more excited for the new releases than my nieces and nephews.<br />This one was the best as it pulled together all of the books.  The ending is fabulous.  I laughed, I cried, I read fast during some scenes and slow for others.  I am a commuter in NY with an hour train ride - Thank goodness for that as I was able to read.  So many people were reading it - men, women, boys and girls, didn't matter the age as this appeals to all ages.<br />Bravo, JK Rowling - you did a wonderful job and gave everyone a story to share with generations to come.
