This is my second time reading The Order of the Phoenix, I am re-reading the last 3 books in the Potter series, because there is so much going on, that one tends to miss alot, with the first reading. I start each of the books in Sept, just as Harry starts back to Hogwarts and read them through the cold Winter nights, rather than have the TV on.<br />The ONLY reason that I have not given the book 5 stars, is that I only to as high as 4, no matter what book it is.<br />Order of the Phoenix was the first time the series really started to get "dark", no more "kiddie" rides from here on out, as the evil side finally shows itself and comes out of the shadows.<br />In this book, the clear "battle lines" are drawn and both sides start to know that a final showdown, is the only way to end this conflict.<br />If you have already finished the series, as most Potter fans have, do yourself a favor and re-read the last 3 books, a second time and I bet you will enjoy them even more, than you did the first time around.
