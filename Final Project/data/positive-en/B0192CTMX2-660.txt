I loved the book, loved how Harry has grown up and is acting like a regular teenager, in fact they all are. Ginny dating!  I Ron being the mad big brother, took to long to get to the real action which is in the last 150 or so pages.  But as reader I understand that "most of it" had a purpose.  Harry has made some mistakes in this book, but so have others "Snape" for not getting over something that was almost 20 years ago. And the Headmaster for treating Harry like a child which he never got to be, and so he was not one.  Interesting though, Luna was a nice new character and I like the way you involved the other houses in teh "DA" club, so that now is not just a "Harry" show in a way, that there are other people out there.  It is growing with every book and Loved the way the twins did their teenage things, it is nice to be reminded that these for the most part are regular kids, with teenage feelings and moods. There was some random and truly uncalled scencs, the extra Giant could have been left out and a couple of other things could have been cut and still had the book and events happen. Loved seeing Harry mad even when sometimes he had no reason, but once again, that is how Teenagers act.  I am hoping that Harry depressed and more indepth mind set will give him the strenght to be the last one standing come book 7.
