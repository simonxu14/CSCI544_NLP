My 7 year old loves this book. He flips through it everyday, carries it around, and constantly has to show it other people. He's one of those kids who really enjoys encyclopedia-esque books that give you little summaries and facts about characters. This book he especially loves because it shows the evolutions of the characters. I can't say that I've actually sat down and read very much of it myself, but it has good illustrations and anything that gets him to read is a win in my book.
