But it was really good. My husband, a close friend and I have spent the last three years pondering and questioning the end. We probably each wrote an entire thesis comparing themes, character development and all that boring stuff I never contemplated until this series. I was terrified that Rowling would cave and give us easy answers in a hurried ending. JKR - thank you. I can't wait to share these books with my son. I honestly believe that this series has made me a better reader - and when I found a reference to a bezoar in a 16th-century history I was reading (for fun!) I couldn't stop laughing.
