When I first read this book 12 years ago, I was all of 12 years old. I'd never really been into books at that point in my life, but apparently my mom thought that that ought to change. One night, a copy of this book showed up on my nightstand, with a note saying that this book was apparently quite popular with boys my age. Reluctantly, I began to read it, and was unexpectedly sucked in to a world of magic the likes of which I'd never quite imagined. I churned through it quickly, and read it several times over, eagerly anticipating the release of the next book.<br /><br />As much as I enjoyed it, when I learned that my girlfriend hadn't yet shared the experience, I decided to buy her a copy for Christmas. She recently finished it, and now I'm rereading it. Gotta say, the book's just as good as I remember it being all those years ago.. I would recommend it to anybody.
