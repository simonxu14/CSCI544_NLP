Was any book so eagerly awaited as this one? I admit to a slight bit of disappointment--HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX isn't quite as good as I thought it would be. But why is that?<br />Perhaps because it is the darkest book in the series (to date). Lord Voldemort is on the rise again, and his threat hangs over all the characters. But for all the hooplah, you'd expect the Dark Lord to do all sorts of nasty things, wouldn't you? Well, he does a few horrible things, but not too many. In fact, I felt Voldemort was a bit on the quiet side, which probably means he'll be in fine fettle and killing the good guyes right and left in Book 6.<br />Then, perhaps it's because Harry is just now growing up a bit. He's 15 years old, and he's just had a major growth spurt. His hormones are in flux, and poor Harry is prone to outbursts of anger when he is tried too far.<br />Perhaps it's because Professor Dumbledore is visibly missing-in-action during most of the book. We get a glimpse of him here and there, but gone are the intimate exchanges between himself and Harry.<br />On the other hand, it just may be because Harry doesn't have quite as much to do in this book as he did in previous ones. After you've been in a Tri-Wizard Tournament fighting off dragons, hexes, and the like, I'm sure life does tend to get a bit boring. &lt;grin><br />However, all in all, it is a welcome sequel to GOBLET OF FIRE. Students just finishing their exams can sympathize with Harry, Hermione and Ron as they struggle with their huge courseload and upcoming O.W.L exams. The new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher is one we all can (hem, hem) hate vehemently. Fred and George Weasley are in fine form and are putting Harry's Tournament winnings to good use in getting their joke shop started. Best of all, in my opinion, was "Dumbledore's Army" (I won't say more and spoil the effect).<br />If you're a Harry Potter fan, be sure to read this one. And listen to the audio version, too. It always adds another dimension to the story.
