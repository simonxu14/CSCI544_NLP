In J.K. Rowling's sequel to _The Sorcerer's Stone_ we learn more of the magical world of Harry Potter.  It is simply delightful to return to Harry's second year at Hogwarts, meeting new characters like the Herbology professor, Ms Sprout, or the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Gilderoy Lockheart, and the Whomping Willow, and to learn more about Hermione and the Weasleys.  The imagination of Ms. Rowling allows adults (such as myself) to again feel the magic of youth.<br />In _The Chamber of Secrets_, the plot centers around Hogwarts students who are being turned to stone, and a possible plot to once again harm our intrepid hero, Harry.  Rowling's prowess at writing a mystery is just as adept as her writing of fiction.  It is simply a delighful read and I highly recommend it.
