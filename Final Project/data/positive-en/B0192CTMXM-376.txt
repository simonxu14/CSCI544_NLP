This review applies to this book and the other one I have read: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. A compelling and entertaining story with fresh twists and turns. Really, though, the whole series is a single story, so It would be better to start at the beginning and read through to the end. It's clear, for the most part, that the bad guys are bad and the good guys are good, but Rowling does muddy the waters sometimes in a manipulative way. This applies to Snape, who seems to be a Slytherin baddie, but eventually turns out to be a self-sacrificing hero. It's ironic that fundamentalist Christian groups--not true Christians at all--have objected to the witchy trappings of the stories, considering that the whole story is a Christian allegory, with the Chosen One offering himself for sacrifice at the end and then is resurrected. It cannot be an accident that, in an age of declining readership, so many have read Rowling's stories.
