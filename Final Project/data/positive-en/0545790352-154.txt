I ordered this book with a coupon offer from Amazon. It was back ordered so it took a long time before I received it. Considering I had a coupon, it was worth the wait. The book is beautiful and arrived in perfect condition. I have it sitting out in my living room so house guests can enjoy it. I hope they continue to make these illustrated versions!
