I think this final year really pulls off with a bang.<br /><br />The story goes by fast just like any Potter book. It answers lots of questions left off from the previous books. Some people say that there are some loopholes throughout the story but I suppose, those should be left for the readers' imaginations.<br /><br />The book isn't kidding about deaths. There will even be some unexpected deaths so I warn some of you who are very connected with certain characters to brace yourselves. You will also know the fate of Snape and the truth behind his actions.<br /><br />The middle part of the story may feel a bit well, slow, but that is a very good part on Rowling's behalf. ^_^  It shows character growth among the characters and is essential to their relationship.<br /><br />There will be parts that will make you laugh, make you insane, and other parts that might make you go "ah-ha! That person's theory is correct!"  Depending on your guesses and speculations, I can only applaud a certain number of you for getting some things right. ^_0<br /><br />The epilogue is probably, I have to agree, a little on the weak side. It's a bit cliched but that's alright. I'm grateful for the ending.  J.K. Rowling gave life to all these characters and the magical world of Hogwarts. She's enchanted millions of readers across the world, young and old, with her very own magic as well.<br /><br />Throughout the 10 years of adventure, Harry Potter has gotten what he always wanted.  A family.  Not just in the book but from the fans as well. :D<br /><br />Thank you J.K. Rowling for all that you've done,<br />You've made Deathly Hallows number one on Amazon,<br />Watch as the good guys battle the Death Eaters' rule,<br />As Harry must come face to face with You-Know-Who....<br /><br />Note: Since my last review was taken off probably due to a stated reference to a spoiler (in my comment), I apologize for that. ^__^  Although, it was just a gratuity poem which didn't really reveal much, I should've put a spoiler warning anyways.
