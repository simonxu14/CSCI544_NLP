*Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* is the bittersweet end of the Harry Potter series.  So, take your sweet time and soak up this last book and all those charms you've come to know throughout the series.<br /><br />If you've been a loyal fan of Harry Potter, then you pretty much know what has been accumulating in regards to the battle between the magical community versus Lord Voldemort.  Rowling doesn't disappoint in this book because she sprinkles revelations throughout the book.  Some of them, you might have already known or suspected and others were a surprise.<br /><br />The ONLY thing that I didn't like was the epilogue.  I will refrain from stating why so that I won't spoil it for others.  I just felt that the last sentence in the last paragraph was perfect.  The epilogue kind of tainted the series a tad bit.  So, I'll just pretend that I didn't read the epilogue.<br /><br />Other than that, it was a good series that has captured the attention of the world.  It'll be a while before something like this occurs again.
