This book was more than I expected from J.K. Rowling, it is really exciting and amazing.  We can clearly see that Harry is growing up and that he's becoming a great wizard.  All the elements of the previous books are here and there many new things happening that don't let you put the book down until you finish reading it.  I hope we don't have to wait another 3 years for book 6...
