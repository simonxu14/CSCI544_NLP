I finished this about 5 this morning, and i have to say that I found it rather glum.  DO NOT missunderstand me this book is fantastic, Rowling's writing brings out a flood of emotions, and keept me spellbound through all 850 some odd pages.  This is a must read for everyone.  Just don't expect a cheary feel good story, this is by far the darkest and scariest book in the series, but in my openion the best so far.  My advice get it, read it, and reread it countless times, I know I will.
