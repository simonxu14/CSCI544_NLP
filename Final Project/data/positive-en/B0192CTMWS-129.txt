While I haven't yet listened to the sixth Harry Potter book read by Jim Dale, I am very impressed with his reading of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. In fact, it was just hearing a portion of this audio version of the book which prompted me to pick up the book series two years ago.<br /><br />Many people say that audio books shouldn't be purchased because you listen to them only once and then they are useless. With the Harry Potter series read by Jim Dale, I completely disagree. I have a 40 minute commute and will listen to the books over and over again, and my delight in the stories and in Dale's reading has not diminished yet.
