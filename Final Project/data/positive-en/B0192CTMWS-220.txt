I liked the last several chapters.  I anticipated several of the things that happened and I was quite pleased with how the story wrapped up.  I think the ending was fairly powerful, albeit somewhat compromising, but probably the only way appease the most readers.  I believed it worked well.<br /><br />The main body of the book felt a little disjointed.  I found far too many irrational convenient coincidences that had me rolling my eyes several times.  To me, it felt somewhat forced.  "Oh, yeah, right," was my common muttering.<br /><br />I enjoyed the way Rowling intertwined elements of all the books to bring the story "full circle".  It gave me the feel of closure to a great series.
