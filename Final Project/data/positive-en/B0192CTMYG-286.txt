You'll be the Sheherezade of your neighborhood, reuniting long lost families, seeing them gather cosily around the boom box, stereo, CD player, or the cassette player in the car...just don't miss out on sharing the  audio version of Harry Potter with your family, friends, children,  neighbors' children and/or perfect strangers/pets (if that's all that's  available)!<br />There hasn't been a TV series or movie this good in decades,  and the guy who does the reading for the story should get some kind of  award, if he hasn't already. I thought it would be really hard to find  someone who wouldn't lose some of the magic of reading Harry Potter and  imagining each of the characters in my head--BOY, was I wrong!<br />Every kid  who enters my car wants to come and live at our house so they can keep  listening!  When my daughter's birthday celebration with a friend was  supposed to move from MacDonald's to the nail salon for manicures and  pedicures, they asked if they could just sit in the car with their  hamburgers and listen to the tape!  Then, they wanted to go home and read  the books again--it's addictive, I find myself listening to the tapes even  when the kids aren't in the car and trying to remember where they left off  so I can rewind back to that spot for when I pick them up--otherwise, the  kids rumble revolution!  This could bring back radio if we're not  careful....
