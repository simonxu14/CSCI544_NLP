Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix is the most psychologically deep of the Harry Potter books that I've read (I haven't read 4, 6, or 7.) The Ministry of Magic launches a crusade against the perceived sub-standard curriculum of Hogwarts under headmaster Albus Dumbledore, while Voldemort and his Death Eaters launch a brazen attack on the shadowy Department of Mysteries.<br /><br />The twin plot-line makes the 870 pages fly by, as the reader becomes psychologically invested in whether Harry Potter and the collection of wizards that make up the Order of the Phoenix can stop Voldemort and his Death Eaters, while saving Hogwarts from the meddling hand of the Ministry of Magic.  Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix still features many of the things that I like about the earlier books, but enters into more adult themes, signifying that the characters in the book and its' young readers were getting older as well.
