When Book 4 of the Harry Potter series, Goblet of Fire, was released there was much written about the "dark" turn the series had taken.  Clearly, the plot and characters had seasoned and more appropriately reflected the increasing impact that external factors have upon each of us as we age.  In Book 5, The Order of the Phoenix, this seasoning of the story line and characters continues.  The relationships between Harry and his friends, mentors, teachers and enemies take on a decidedly more mature tone.  The character interactions and motivations are more complex including the labile and sometimes painful emotions of the teenaged adolescent.  In addition, the consequences of decisions and actions are more serious but also are true to life.  In The Order of the Phoenix there is a continued building of the original story with additional background provided regarding several main characters.  This book was not as tightly knit as the previous books in the series as the actual Order of the Phoenix, its origins and purpose were not fully defined to this reader's satisfaction.  However, the rich context and remarkably creative imagery that J.K. Rowling has used to create the believable "wizarding world" are found in this book in full measure.  Absolutely a pleasure to read - Book 5 has enhanced the luster of this series.
