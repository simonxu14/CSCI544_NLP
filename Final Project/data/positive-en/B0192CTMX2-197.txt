Such timing in finishing this incredible read...  I had read all but Deathly Hallows in this series, so was doubly saddened to hear of Alan Rickman's death last week.  Even though I'd seen the movie and knew the ending, it was (as usual) more engrossing to hear/read the book.  These characters were so carefully sculpted; I just know if I looked hard enough, I'd find Diagon Alley!  Great finish to a wonderful series.
