Okay for gods sake stop making Pokemon books, my 10 year old is going to make me file bankruptcy just to keep her books up to date. Enough already. Seriously though, she loves this book, its by far her favorite so far. I was a little nervous it might get bent or folded up in shipping but it arrived in perfect condition and she couldn't have been happier(unless maybe there had been a live Pokemon in the box as well). I'm sure we'll be ordering more books soon.
