The seventh Harry Potter book. It was just as action packed and mysterious as the other six, but there are some necessary differences.<br /><br />Dumbledore is gone, but his ghost is present through many of Harry's actions. Dumbledore's relative absence from the seventh book is necessary because it allows Harry Potter to take the lead in the final battle against  Voldemort and his Death Eaters.<br /><br />This was Harry Potter's definitive growing up moment. It's also a real testament that Rowling gave everyone their crowning moment, even in death. Many old friends return for the final battle of Hogwarts as the series comes to a close.<br /><br />It would've been easy to let Harry Potter have all the glory of the final victory. By not doing that, it reinforces Potter's image as the anti-Voldemort. There's also something distinctly human about this seventh book. The conflicts between Harry and Dumbledore over who the ladder really is and the conflicts between best friends Harry, Ron, and Herimone lead one to question who their true friends are.<br /><br />In between these conflicts, and the ever present question of whose side Snape is on, the final Harry Potter hits a home run.
