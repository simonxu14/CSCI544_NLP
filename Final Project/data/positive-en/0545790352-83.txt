I love this book! It is basically the full chapter book but with illustrations all along the way. The art work is so wonderful and it really transports you there as your reading. Im so excited for my second grader to read this book. I read it for the first time almost 16 years ago and now they have this version! Too cool! I hope they make the whole series!!!
