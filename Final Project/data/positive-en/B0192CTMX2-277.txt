I just got into the Harry Potter books a month or so ago (yes, I'm late on the bandwagon). Overall, I loved all the books, even if book 6 was a bit slow and boring.<br /><br />I liked this last book a lot and it had the right amount of action and story development to keep me entertained throughout. We learn a lot about Dumbledore and can see each of the characters growing into their own as adults. There are serious issues though, that prevent me from giving it a full five stars.<br /><br />I don't mind that characters had to die, but some of the main characters didn't even get their own death scene. Also the fact that Rowling killed off certain people "because she wanted an orphan from the war" was beyond stupid; these and other deaths were unneeded (seriously, leave the hot guys alone already). I also dislike what she made Draco into.<br /><br />Also, the epilogue is pathetic. While I appreciate the fact that she included an epilogue in the first place (because I am anal about knowing the final ending), it is nowhere near complete. She leaves so many questions unanswered and the epilogue creates even more questions. I kind of wish that instead of the epilogue, there was an additional chapter that described the immediate aftermath of everything or summarized the next year or two. I hate loose ends and can only hope that, if she chooses to make an 'encyclopedia' as she has hinted at, she will take care of most of these unanswered questions.
