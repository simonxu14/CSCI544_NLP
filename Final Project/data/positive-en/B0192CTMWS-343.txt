This book made me cry so many times, and this last installment of the Harry Potter series did not provide as much closure as I needed after following Mr. Potter throughout my childhood and teenage years. I wish the outcome was not as it is in this book, the writing was just so damn captivating that I couldn't put it down. There are also a lot of life lessons that I learned from this series and recommend it to all ages.
