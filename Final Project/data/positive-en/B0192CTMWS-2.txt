I am 27 years old and I have loved all three books in the Harry Potter series.  I've enjoyed watching Harry grow in each of the three books.  I read these books and just delight in Rowlings characterizations and imagination.  I got this book for Christmas this year and yesterday was the  first time I had to sit down and start reading.  I couldn't go to bed until  I finished the book.<br />I read these books and I think how I can't wait to  share Harry and his friends with my children someday.  I think of how  disappointed I'll be when the series ends, because already, I feel like I  visit with old friends when I pick up these books.<br />My thanks go out to  J.K. Rowling for sharing her wonderful gift with the world.<br />I recommend  this book to anyone of any age, it is garenteed not to disappoint!
