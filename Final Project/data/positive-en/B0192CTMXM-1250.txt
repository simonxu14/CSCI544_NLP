I sat down to read book 5 and got so absorbed in the story I read the whole book straight through!  (I don't really recommend this, reading for 8 hours straight can do funny things to a person!)  It is so amazing how J. K. Rowling has kept the story fresh through every single book.  Not even a three year wait has dulled the story.  Now we just need book 6!
