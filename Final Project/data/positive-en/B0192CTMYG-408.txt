I have seen all of the HP movies and loved them, however I had not read the books.  My 18 year old son has been encouraging me to read the books since they first came out.  I finally got around to it and LOVE them!!  I like the movies but you must read the books if you have not.  Wish I would have read them before the movies came out.
