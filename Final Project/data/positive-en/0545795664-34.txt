My son loves Pokemon so this was a must have - he's already read and worn this book so much, we are already on our second copy. Did you know that Pok&eacute;mon is a media franchise managed by The Pok&eacute;mon Company, a Japanese consortium between Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. The franchise copyright is shared by all three companies, but Nintendo is the sole owner of the trademark? It's true.
