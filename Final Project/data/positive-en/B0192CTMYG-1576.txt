Being that it was used and the price was great, I just couldn't pass it up.  The book was in excellent condition and looked new and my aunt loved it, being from Mexico and unable to get a lot of these books, she was so happy to have received it and can't wait for the other ones.  Thank you for making her Christmas memorable.
