The last and greatest of the series of the boy who lived series.  J.K.Rowling ties up all the loose bits, and answers all those questions that have been popping up since your began the adventure with that young Harry as he neared his 11th birthday.  We have loved Harry since the beginning and watched him grow up in our minds until he has become a part of our families.  Everyone who has devoured the earlier books has known what was coming, even if there have been a few parts that left us stunned with heart break that such things could befall such a fine young man.  His arch enemy has become our most hated enemy and at long last we know that the show down is about to commence.  Our first Harry Potter book entered our home in the hands of my then young 9 year old daughter whose teacher had been reading it to the class bit by bit.  Tired of having to wait for the next installment, my child purchased a copy of the book herself at the schools book fair and a love affair with all things Harry began in our family. If you do nothing else for your children as they are growing up, reading this series with them or to them, is a not to be missed family adventure.
