I purchased the original books for my son, but curiosity got the better of me and I began reading them. I discovered my adult neighbor shared an interest in the Potter saga and we enjoyed discussing the latest adventure for Harry and his friends. Rowling does a great job in making this story a great read after all how many of us as childre wished we had magical powers. I did!!!!
