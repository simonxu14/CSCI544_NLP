I bought this leather bound collector's edition of Chamber of Secrets for my brother. It came in pristine condition even though it is used. He loved it! I also bought the Sorcerer's Stone, which also came in perfect condition. They are well worth the money. I'd like to find the other 5 books eventually, but I could only find books 1 & 2.
