The Order of the Phoenix is not for children under the age of 12--it is too nuanced with the psychological and emotional development of Harry.  Younger kids will enjoy the action, the occasional humor and the inevitable marvelous creatures, but much of the novel will be better understood by adolescents.  Also, a reader who is not thoroughly familiar with the first four books will probably lose interest in Phoenix.  It is full of references to the stories and characters that preceded.  That being said, this 64-year-old Harry Potter buff put aside every obligation and  has just read the volume cover to cover. (Today is June 22.) Couldn't put it down.  The first half is a bit slow-going and the reader needs to adjust to an irritable and depressed hero.  But there are shocking surprises nevertheless, beginning in Chapter 1.  The second half of the book contains one amazing piece of villainy after another.  Professor Umbridge is about the most nauseating of all Rowling's Nasties, including even Snape, and her perfidiousness touches most of the people we have come to know and love.  Will she get her come-uppance?<br />The first two books were magical adventure stories.  The third began to explore emotions and relationships to a greater degree.  The fourth combined elements of the first three, but with an overtone of danger, evil and tragedy.  But the fifth book I thought was the best and most satisfying for the way it pulled together all the threads of the others.  Unlike the fourth, it answered a great many questions and left me feeling satisfied.  If there is another long wait until the sixth volume, and I expect there will be, at least I know that Harry and Company are on the way to a resolution. Now excuse me.  I must go back and read it again, a little more slowly this time.
