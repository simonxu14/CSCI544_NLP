I cried... a lot... and laughed... but mostly cried... reading this book.<br />I think that some people may be a bit put off by some of the deaths that happen because they are so tragic, but if you approach it with from a literary standpoint they were necessary in the 'grand scheme' of things. I don't feel it's appropriate for me to speak plainly about those events merely because it is not my intent to divulge information about what happens in this book for those few who might not have read it yet. I will say though that I wonder what happened to the Dursleys after everything.<br /><br />It was a little bit of a difficult read the first time around (maybe because I first read it in one straight read into the not-so-early hours of the next day by which point my mental acuity was waning), in the sense that a lot of things happen so fast that it was a little difficult to absorb them the first time around and sometimes I would double back a paragraph or a page to re-read something because my mind glassed over an obscure detail that was then referenced. J. K. Rowling really has a habit of setting you up for things to come - some of her setups are more obvious or more cleverly done than others so you really need to pay attention to minute details when reading her books, and in no other book is that so important than this one.<br />A lot of the things that happened in this book I expected, or I at least had a hunch about... even the whole thing with Snape and his 'true colors' (though I never imagined the extent of it).<br /><br />I loved this book and I think the Harry Potter series is such a success because it is filled with wonderful, quirky characters with whom everyone can relate, characters that grow with you as much as you grow with them.<br /><br />To quote from the TV series 'Scrubs': "...I love Harry Potter so much sometimes I wish I was a wizard..."<br /><br />I (and millions of others I am sure) just really hope that some day J. K. Rowling puts out more Harry Potter books. I don't really feel like there could ever be a true end to this story.
