I know that everyone has probably read the book, watched the movie, heard the music...but I just love the audio book.  It gives the story a whole new depth.  Jim Dale does a great job (although some of his pronunciations differ some what from what we're used to).  It really brings the book to life.  Since the movie couldn't cover the whole content of the book, the audio book does a great job.  You can still use your own imagination while listening to the book.  I love you J. K.  I just can't wait for the next movie to come out...and of course, the final book!!!
