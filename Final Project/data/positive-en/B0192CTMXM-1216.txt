I'm not going to write a long and drawn out point by point review of this book.  All I will say is that if you are HP fan, you will enjoy this final installment of the life of the boy wizard. You can't please everyone, so some people were disappointed in this book, my personal opinion is, it was worth being a fan all of these years and waiting for the seventh one. Enjoy!!
