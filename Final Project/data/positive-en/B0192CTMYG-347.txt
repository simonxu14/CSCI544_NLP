I started reading this to my six year-old son about a month ago.  It was slow going, mainly because of his attention span.  But he's been enjoying it, nevertheless.  As I was reading it to him, I became enthralled with the  adventure and wound up reading the book by myself.  It was a great,  fast-paced read that brought out the child in me.Like everybody else, I've  been hearing the controversy.  Yes, there are some situations in the story  that might scare small children.  Pick up a book of fairy tales­­or, better  yet, turn on the TV.  The cartoons and kids' shows are much more violent  and graphic than anything in this book.  The Harry Potter series is  destined to be a classic for many generations.
