This is definetley an achievement for anyone under the age of 12 to read.  It's twice the size of the other books.  Heres some clues to what happens: Harry is submitted into the Triwizard contest, where three wizards from  different schools compete against each other.  He was submitted under the  age limit by someone unknown.  Because he was listed under a different  school, he was picked as a champion.  This makes two Hogwarts champions.  The other is the Hufflepuff seeker, Cedric Diggory.  The new  defense-against-the-dark-arts teacher is Mad Eye Moody, an auror for the  Ministry of magic. I won't tell you who gets killed-that would ruin the  whole book.  But I will tell you this- it's a student and he wasn't a main  character. Harry dosen't really get a girlfriend though he does have a huge  crush on Cho Chang, the ravenclaw seeker.  There's also no quidditch played  in this book, so we don't find out who the new captain is until the next  book.  Sirius is back, and so is Pettigrew (Wormtail).  Percy's back, now  working for the Ministry, and you finally get to meet Bill and Charlie, the  oldest Weasley brothers.  Harry also gets to go to see the World Quidditch  Cup with the Weasley family.  Read this book If you loved the others.  It's  great.  Voldemort also rises again and I for one can't wait to find out  what happens in the next 3 books.  That will be awhile though.
