I've had my issues with the writing of this series--literally, with how portions of it were written.  They could have been stronger, better, shorter, longer...  I don't like a lot of the details of where JKR took things in DH, but ultimately she gave Harry what he needed, what we have protectively fostered in him from the beginning:  a sense of himself, his own power.  For that I give JKR cheers for sustaining her momentum over 7 books, the infrastructure that created a new archetype emblazoned in the consciousness of millions.  Along her pages we have grown.
