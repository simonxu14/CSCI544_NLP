Harry Potter is a GREAT series in both movie form and book form.<br /><br />I grew up with my best friend and her family watching Harry Potter marathons quite often on VHS.<br />As I got older, I got into reading and decided that I would like to own a collection of the Harry Potter books because I loved the movies so much. I started ordering my books from here on amazon and I have not been upset about anything so far from doing so. This book came in good condition, no damage that I've ever noticed and It's sitting on my shelf with the rest of the series!! This is the THIRD book in the series by J.K. Rowling and the only complaint I have in the book series as a whole, is that in parts, I feel like it is quite redundant at times with detail description and I feel some parts could have been written better or described in a better way. This in no way makes me love it any less so if you're not sure to continue this series and this is the next book you need then go ahead and give it a shot!
