I loved the first two Harry Potter books and decided to get the audio tape for the third book.  It is wonderful.  The reader (who is a male with british accent) does a great job telling the story and changes his voice while speaking different charachter parts (Harry, Herimone, Professor McGonagul, etc.)<br />Time will fly while you are in the car when listening.  I have gotten so caught up in the story line that I have actually sat in my driveway in my car for more than a 1/2 hour after arriving because I couldn't "pull" myself away from the story.  I actually look forward to driving when such a great story is being told.<br />There are (7) 1 and 1/2 hour tapes in this set.  Very worth it!  I was going to read the 4th book but I decided that since this has been so much fun listening to, and makes time fly by in my car, that I am going to listen to #4 this way also.<br />I recommend...especially for people that are in the car a lot or traveling and can take along a headset.  You will get addicted!!!
