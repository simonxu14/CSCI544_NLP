The illustrations are absolutely beautiful. It's such an interesting experience to view yet another person's interpretation of what the books look like inside their heads. I bought an extra copy for my niece's and they love it just as much. It is an easier way for youngsters to read the books, and a fun way for adults to enjoy the series all over again. Can't wait for the next one!
