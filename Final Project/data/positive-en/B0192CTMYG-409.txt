What can I say that hasn't already been said by everyone else?  This is the sort of book I would probably have loved when I was a kid.  Now that I'm an adult, I still loved it.  To me, that's the hallmark of a great  children's book: one that doesn't talk down to its audience, one that can  be read and enjoyed by readers of all ages.
