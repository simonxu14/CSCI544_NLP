While not a brillant author in a conventional, award-winning way, JK Rowling doesn't disappoint with her Harry Potter conclusion. She does a good job of weaving a tale and bringing back details forgotten in previous books. After 5 deaths in this one, I lost count. However, don't let it discourage you - Rowling manages to scare you, delight you, make you laugh and cry and has deftly completed this series without any questions. I highly recommend this read to anyone who has enjoyed her book series as it makes a terrific end to a wonderful set of stories.
