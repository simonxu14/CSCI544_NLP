I have avoided purchasing the full HP series because of the cost.  My daughter just began getting into the books and this is really the way to go.  She is awarded a new book once she completes a book.  And I throw out the teaser that the movie can never cover everything that is in the book which motivates her to read even more.  Chamber arrived in excellent condition and was a great value.  Will definitely get her Azkaban when she completes this one.
