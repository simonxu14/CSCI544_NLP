After reading book 6, I was dissappointed and felt like JK Rowling was succumbing to the media, and the easy sell of violence and surprise. After reading book 7 I no longer feel that way, I feel like every loose end was tied up and all the charachters were left in a good place at the end of the book. This was by far the best book, but you really have to read them all and have a good memory to enjoy all the little details of this book. I love this series and JK Rowling has done a wonderful service to the world by encouraging children to read. Thank you Ms. Rowling.
