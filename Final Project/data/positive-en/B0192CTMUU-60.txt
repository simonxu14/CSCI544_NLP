GREAT BOOK ! I couldn't put it down. I read the entire book in less than one day. You really should read Books 1,2, and 3 first though. It will make more sense that way. I love the characters and the plot. I'm a technology  teacher and I've encouraged other teachers to use this book ( and the first  three) as part of their language arts courses. I have a 4 month old  daughter and I can't wait for her to be old enough so I can read the whole  series to her ! Some people say this is a children's book ~ not so !  Children of any age will enjoy these magical tales of wizards, witches and  scary creatures. Read the Goblet of Fire ~ it's so good you won't want to  put it down.
