I'm an avid reader and have read all the Harry Potter books, some more than once. But I find listening to Jim Dale read the books lends new depth and meaning to the stories. Of course, if you can't take time to read the books, listening to them is a great alternative. But even if you have read the books multiple times, try listening to Jim Dale read one of them. My guess is you'll hear things you never noticed before.
