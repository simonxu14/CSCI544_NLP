Loved this book! It was not long enough. I eagerly couldn't wait to find out what happened at the end, while wishing this rich and stirring tale would never end. A crabby, angst-ridden Harry didn't bother me a bit - he's growing up, he's a normal lad (who happens to be a wizard), not a saint. I was a bit disappointed it didn't work out with Cho, but that part rang true in teen relationships - you hardly ever end up with your first crush. (I bet Harry ends up with Ginny). The only part I found exception to was the death of the person very close to Harry who I was very fond of too. (Please bring him back J.K.! I don't care how you do it, but bring him back!) I know she won't, because that would be cheating, but I cried my eyes out when this character died. This was a very valuable character who could've provide Harry insight into Harry's past - more about what his parents were like and possibly in the future giving Harry valuable advice about being a man, girls, etc. I felt like this was just too harsh for Harry to lose someone he cared about so much and who loved him just as much. And moreover, this character was very [appealing]! ... Anyway I will miss this fabulous, mysterious character and in the wizard world where all kinds of things can happen, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that in a future book, maybe Harry can go behind that black veil and drag this person back!
