Even though the book did arrive on the day of its release, it didn't arrive at our home until later in the afternoon. I was out and about in the morning running errands and noticed that the book was in plentiful supply. It was fustrating seeing the book in plentiful supply and not being able to buy it because I had already pre-ordered it.
