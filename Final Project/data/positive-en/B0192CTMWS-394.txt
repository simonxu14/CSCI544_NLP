I was looking forward to this book for soo long and am very dissapointed by the outcome.  The book was very interesting but the end was very dissapointing the way the left the characters and really not much on information on the characters that we have grown with and loved.  It is like she spent so much time writing so much detail in the book and then the epiloge sucked.  Just my opinion and I am hoping she will oneday write more on the series, maybe even their children.
