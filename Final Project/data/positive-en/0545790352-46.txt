I assume most people are already familiar with the story and writing of Sorcerer's Stone.  I am concerned here with the layout and the illustrations, both of which were magical.  The illustrations ran from simple page texture to two-page spreads, from small embellishments (like the spiders in Harry's cupboard crawling across the page) to diagrams of the differences between dragon eggs.  At no point did I feel like the illustrations got in the way of the text and my ability to read it.<br /><br />I was equally happy to see that the illustrations were a mix of originality and previous expectation.  Without having to read the accompanying text, I could tell that this image was of Snape, or that was of Neville.  But they weren't drawings taken directly from the films.  They were unique and taken directly from text description.<br /><br />I am delighted to add this book to my collection and eagerly await the illustrated editions for the rest of the series!
