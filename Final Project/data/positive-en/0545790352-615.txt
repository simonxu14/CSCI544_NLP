What a fantastic book! I think the reason my 5 year old twins were able to get started on reading HP so early is that this book is so beautifully illustrated. The subsequent books are not illustrated, but they are still totally hanging on my every word because this book gave them the images that are now in their heads when we read the later books.  Might be the best book I've ever read with my little kiddos.
