I love these new illustrated editions. It makes reading to a younger generation of Harry Potter fans easier with the illustrations and larger font. They are absolutely gorgeous. The cloth ribbon bookmark is a great touch and you can tell a lot of care and thought went into the making of these editions. Can't wait for the others to come out.
