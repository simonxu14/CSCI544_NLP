The day "The Order of the Phoenix" came into our home, it immediately became a volleyball between myself, my wife and my 8 year old son.  Woe betide the person who put this book down to grab a bite to eat or something to drink, because it would be immediately snatched up for avid reading by one of the other two.<br />After several days (and one SERIOUSLY late night of reading), I just finished the book............<br />EXCELLENT!<br />Ms. Rowling's writing is improving with each book (which is to say nothing at all bad about the writing in the first one).  In "The Order of the Phoenix", I think she has wonderfully captured the rollercoaster of emotions that Harry goes through as an adolescent male.<br />The story is getting more intricate (and darker) and the characters are developed nicely.  I particularly like the attention she gave to deepening both Ron and Hermione (and WHEN are THEY going to kiss?!?  Clearly there seems to be some mutual attraction developing between the two of them. :-)<br />The magic is marvelous and the spells are spectacular.  A slight aside, I continue to be amazed at how Harry continues to struggle with trusting Dumbledore......and withholding information from him.  Dumbledore has saved Harry countless times, so the trust seems well-placed.  Personally, I think it's time to lay this literary device to rest.<br />And yes, one of the characters dies.  A loss to the story line, but (whew!) not one of my favorites......<br />All in all, just a wonderful read.<br />I can't wait for the next volume to come out and I wish "The Order of the Phoenix" was longer.<br />I can't think of any higher praise.<br />Thank you, Ms. Rowling for the sweat and tears that went into this book!<br />Cheers!
