The text is the original British text though the title is the American title.<br />I know many people are familiar with the American audio books read by Jim Dale; if you want to hear the British audio books search for Stephen Fry Harry Potter Audiobook. If you can't find them on the American Amazon website, just change your store to Canada or UK and order from there.<br /><br />The illustrations are amazing. Each page has some form of art, even if it's just ink stains on parchment. I like that the art isn't based on the movie since I read the books long before the movies came out and had my own versions of what the characters looked like. I especially like the illustrations of Hagrid on the motorbike, it fits my image of what Hagrid must have looked like on a standard size motorcycle.<br /><br />My copy of the book had some scratches on the cover and a couple of the pages had pinhole head size holes in them which was disappointing. I assume this happened during storage at the warehouse or while being packaged/shipped. The book had no padding or protection in the shipping box so the corners are a bit dented as well. But I am viewing the book, not Amazon's storage/shipping inadequacies so I didn't take a star off of the rating. (A local b&m store had it stock this afternoon and their copies looked undamaged.)<br /><br />The book is large, be aware of the dimensions in the description; the later books will be even thicker at the same width/length dimensions. It will take up quite a bit of space on your bookshelf or an entire nightstand by itself. It is heavy to hold as well, meant more as a story book you hold on your lap at home, not something you will want to carry around or hold up while you're reading it. The text is in two columns, not the traditional page formatting most of us are probably familiar with. I find the text formatting contributes to it's nighttime storybook feel admirably.<br /><br />I will most assuredly purchase the rest of the illustrated series, regardless of how much bookshelf space it takes!
