Before I start, I want to note that this review is for the Japanese edition of the Philosopher's stone.<br />The story is as amazing as the English edition, and the translation is very faithful to the original (without reading awkwardly in Japanese) which is very nice. Overall, the translation is great and leaves nothing out from the English edition.<br />The binding is great as well, paper is of very good quality (slightly transparent, which was expected; paper is very sturdy).<br />Chapter illustrations may seem simplistic at first glance, but I found them to be charming.<br />Furigana is included with most kanji, however there are a few kanji which do not feature furigana. The only problems I had with furigana is that it is slightly inconsistent; some 2nd grade kanji featuring furigana with some 4th grade kanji not. However, considering the target audience, it's not that big of a deal.<br />Overall a really great book for new fans of the series or anyone reliving childhood memories.
