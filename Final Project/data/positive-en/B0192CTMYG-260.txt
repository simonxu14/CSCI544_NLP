We have never been interested in this series of books, but our son has been having a hard time finding a series of boy books that he can really get into. So, on a whim we decided to try out the Sorcerer's Stone, not having a huge amount of hope for it being something that he would be into reading. Not only was he incredibly into it, but we read it as a family, and we found all of ourselves on the edge of our seats. We could hardly put it down each night in anticipation for what the next chapter held. It was a fantastic read, and incredibly well written piece of work. Absolutely loved it!
