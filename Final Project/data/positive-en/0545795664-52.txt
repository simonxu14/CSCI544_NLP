Our 7 year old son loves this book and looks at/ reads it every day. It is an awesome book to reference your Pokemon. Very detailed. The book is in alphabetical order, it as nice pictures of each Pokemon, it gives their background,  their type, how to say their name, height, weight, moves and if they evolve or not.
