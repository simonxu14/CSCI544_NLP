I have to say after watching the Harry Potter and the Order of Phenix movie, I was a little disappointed. The movie simplely cut off a lot of the details that I think are important for the movie viewers to understand how the characters grow in the stories afterwards. After reading the book, however, I am very satisfied with the story. The plots are VERY nicely put together. I expecially love the chapter that Harry Potter finally confronts Lord Voldermont. I also applause Rowling's efforts into the writing of Harry Potter series. It brings the people back to reading!!! If you are a fan of Harry Potter and his magical world, you have "GOT" to READ the book.
