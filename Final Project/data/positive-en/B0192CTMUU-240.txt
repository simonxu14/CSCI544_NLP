Harry, Ron, Hermoine and the rest of the gang are doing it again in J.K. Rowling's 4th book of the series, Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire.  The writing doesn't simply lie there like in most ordinary books, it jumps out to you, and pulls you into a magic world of wizards, dragons, quidditch, and even You-Know-Who!  I actually stayed up until 3:00 on a school night just to read!  I HIGHLY RECCOMEND this book, and the the rest of this fantastic series to any age of reader, interested in fantasy or not.  I've read the series a total of about 5 times, and each time it gets better, and better.  Please take my advice and order this book immediatly!  It's most definatly worth it! :D Thanx!
