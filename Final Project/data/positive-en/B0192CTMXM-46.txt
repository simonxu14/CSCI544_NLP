There are four Harry Potter books that were written before the order of the Phoenix, which I thoroughly enjoyed reading, but I was skeptical about reading the Order of the Phoenix, due to its length. Usually it's hard for an author to keep a series interesting as it progresses, but J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series actually gets better with each story. The Order of the Phoenix is well written and is definitely a page turner
