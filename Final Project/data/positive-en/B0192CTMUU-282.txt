I had already read this book, but I enjoyed the entire series. At times I like to re-read a book that I've read before. In this case the first time was when I borrowed it from my my local library. I've never purchased a used book before, but I thought I'd give it a try. I researched the ratings of several book sellers on Amazon and found one that seemed to be one that I felt I could trust. For the price I couldn't have made a better choice. I would definitely purchase a used book from this seller again. Thanks.
