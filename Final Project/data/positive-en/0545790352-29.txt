This edition of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is absolutely stunning! The book is about twice the size of the regular hardback edition, and the illustrations are all colorful, detailed, and exquisitely done. The chapter listing is even illustrated. Under the dustcover is a red binding/cover, with the name and author embossed in gold on the spine. There is a red grosgrain ribbon page marker inside the book. I've tucked this into the dustcover, as I am concerned about the red of the grosgrain bleeding onto pages over time. The inside cover is a beautiful illustration of Hogwarts Castle. As I flip through the pages, the characters and key points are imagined into colorful, highly detailed illustrations, presumably along the lines of what JKR originally imagined. I'm sure many will upload photos of the drawings, but I don't want to spoil the magic of discovering these for the first time for anyone. The book has roughly the size and feel of an average elementary school textbook, the pages are nice and heavy. This might be a wonderful gift for a young reader, still transitioning from picture stories to chapter books, and of course for any Potter fan.
