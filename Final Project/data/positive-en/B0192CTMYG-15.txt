After hearing all the hoopla, I decided to read Harry Potter myself.  It is a truly, wonderful awe inspiring book, one of those that I think will be around for a long time.  Hopefully it will soon be required reading.  Harry Potter is an admirable and interesting main character.  The story has  elements of classic well-loved movies and novels, and many important  themes, like not to give up when obstacles come your way, or the fact that  there's always going to be mean, nasty and/or annoying people wherever you  go, but you can learn to live with that.  As for people who think the book  is Satanic--I have three things to tell them. 1.  The book is a work of  fiction--fiction is a story that's NOT REAL. 2. It's in the fantasy  genre--fantasy is a genre of fiction that deals with magical or  supernatural elements.  3.  There's no mention of Satan worship or the  Bible being bad anywhere in the book. (It actually promotes what could be  termed 'good Christian morals')  I think people who pronounce the book  Satanic or whatever are overreacting and haven't read the book.<br />Who ever  thought in this age of the internet and 100 plus TV channels that kids  would read a 300 plus page book and actually enjoy it?  Not only that,  their parents would read it and enjoy it too!  I can remember being in the  9-12 age bracket and never in a million years could I imagine myself  reading a book as long as &quot;Harry Potter&quot;--and I was voted the  most avid reader in my school!  Obviously, today's kids are a lot smarter  than we give them credit for, and this book is a testament to that.
