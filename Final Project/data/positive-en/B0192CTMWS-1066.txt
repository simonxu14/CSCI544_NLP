Not going to draw this out.<br /><br />Never in a long time have I been more scared reading chapters from a book. Wondering if the next line or the next paragraph or the next page would kill off a character I have grown fond of, or not.<br /><br />Giving nothing away, it's certainly a worthwhile read. I would have perhaps liked to see certain things after the climactic finale, though such things it seems are left to our own imagination.<br /><br />Rowling did a stellar job, considering the pressures etc . .I commend the work, I recommend the book.
