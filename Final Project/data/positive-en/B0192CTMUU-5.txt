Although usually the word &quot;sequel&quot; prepares you to lower your expectations, this fourth installment in the Harry Potter series packs even more excitement, quirky characters, and tightly plotted events than the  previous three books.  Much attention has been paid to its length (734  pages and four pounds), but it is a supremely satisfying read.  You will  want to savor every page.  Although most of the major plot elements of this  volume are resolved by the end, the author hints at some of the challenges  which lie ahead for our hero, paving the way for more excitement in volume  five.  Film critic Roger Ebert writes that the reason the &quot;Star  Wars&quot; series is so successful is that its creator George Lucas pays  careful attention to even the minutest detail, populating even the corners  of the frame with interesting characters.  In much the same way, J. K.  Rowling packs the Harry Potter books with so much detail that the world of  witches and wizards comes alive.  In &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;, this  enchanting world is revealed in greater scope, with more of the action  taking place in the wider world outside the Hogwarts School.  We learn for  the first time of the existence of other schools of wizardry, and we meet  characters from other cultures.  Although so many things about the  wizarding world are different, at the same time we can really identify with  the thoughts and feelings of these characters:  the awkwardness of  adolescence, the loneliness of an orphaned boy and the excitement of first  love.  Rowling has written a book to delight Harry Potter fans everywhere.  My question is, how long until she produces volume 5?
