As Harry grows, so do the stories in their depth and complexity.  This may be a challenging read for younger readers, with some scary parts.<br />However, modern kids have seen far worse on TV and in the movies, and  should not have trouble dealing with the more mature elements of the  story.<br />The story unfolds a bit slowly in comparison to the other tales,  but before you know it you're staying up late to finish it, and writing  your review in Amazon when you should really be sleeping!<br />I won't give  away any story details.  Grab a torch (flashlight) and hide under the  covers for another entrancing read.<br />Can I order book 5 now?  And when  does Sirius Black get his own story told!
