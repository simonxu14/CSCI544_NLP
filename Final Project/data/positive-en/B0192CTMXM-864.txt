I was concerned that the many distractions might result in a lesser effort but Rowling has presented us with another terrific read. Harry is again in big big trouble in book 5 -<br />no surprize there, huh? I wont ruin it if you havent read the book yet... but there are some inventive twists and surprizes.<br />Interesting that pure wizards and those of non-pure wizard lineage are on equal footing!?! I wonder where Rowling is going here. Despite the fears of many about the occult themes this series has more kids READING than anything in recent years. As Rowling pointed out kids dont ask her about the occult they ask what is going to happen to the three main characters. So just buy the books and leave them around - your kids will starting reading. The gift of the love of reading is PRICELESS and LIFE-LONG. Of course if you're reading this YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT!!!
