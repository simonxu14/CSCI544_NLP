The Prisoner of Azkaban is the third book in the Harry Potter series and another winner for the genius J. K. Rowling.  The continuation of the escapades of Harry and his best friends Ron and Hermione keep the reader obsessed with finishing another great read.<br />Harry spends another horrid summer at the Dursleys and agrees to "act normal" during the visit of the beastly Aunt Marge (in order to receive a signature on a pass to Hogsmeade).  Harry does fine until Aunt Marge severely criticizes his parents.  As seen in all three books, Harry cannot hold his temper where his parents are concerned.  He blows up Marge and runs away in fear of retribution from both the Dursleys and Hogwarts.  Thus, the adventures begin!  I really don't like to tell too much about the book in my reviews because I believe it spoils the plot for the reader.  Just trust me when I say that this book is another fabulous classic.  I am very stingy when it comes to giving a book 5 stars.  I do this only if I want to read the book again and again.  I am an adult who admits to reading this series three times and who is truly looking forward to the 5th book!
