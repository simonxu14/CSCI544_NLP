The man reading this book is a genius with voices!  Because the book is so long, it does get tedious listening to it, but I still enjoy listening to it while I drive.  Although I've read all the books, I still feel like book five is the book that is packed full of information (backwards and forwards) leading you into the last two.  Sometimes I found myself bored by all the drawn out descriptions, but I was patient with them because #1...I love Harry Potter, and #2...I have a sneaking suspicion that these details are important for all that is to come.  Altogether, a good tie-together of a book.  You really have to stay on top of the discs, but still a great listen!
