I've never read any of the Harry Potter books until now that I've read Deathly Hallows first and then The Half Blood Prince...  But I did have an interest in Harry Potter because I own DVD movies one through four and I'm going to buy Order of the Phoenix once the DVD is out..  I didn't have an interest in reading books one through five because I've already seen the movies so I said to myself Deathly Hallows is the last book it must be really good so I took a chance and bought it... I don't regret one bit buying Deathly Hallows and reading it without reading Half Blood Prince sure I was a bit lost but it didn't take away from me enjoying reading Deathly Hallows.. When I read Deathly Hallows it was like reading a movie, imagining the actors Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliff, and the red head guy doing what Harry, Hermione, and Ron would be doing in the book!! Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a very good book to read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
