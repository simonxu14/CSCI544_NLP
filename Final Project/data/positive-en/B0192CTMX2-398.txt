I received my order at least one week late, but I was notified via snail mail and that was OK.  When I finally received my book, like a kid with a new toy I made sure I had no interruptions and only had the time for my book.  It only took me 3 afternoons of time to finish but I was not surprised by the results.  Lots of drama for Harry and his friends, the plot was more adult in content than usual but that was fine with me.  I am most happy with the ending.
