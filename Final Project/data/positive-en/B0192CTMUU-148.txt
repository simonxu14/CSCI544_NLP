I started this book on 12 pm and at 4 pm I begged myself to put it down in order to make it last.  But my plea fell on deaf ears, by 11:30 pm that night I was done. That should be your first clue on how good the book  is.<br />This book most certainly lives up to the hype and mystery that  surrounded it release. J. K . Rowling opens a very clear door into Harry's  world.<br />I have never read a book that grabs from the first word and  refuses to let you go until the last.  Every time I turned a page, my world  seemed less real, while Harry's seemed more.<br />Although, this is a 735  page book, it was like &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; the frist time you  saw it. When you turn the last page, and read the last word you'll  atomactically keep reading, and when confronted with a blank page, it will  take a while to dawn on you that it is blank because the book is done.<br />I  have read many books that where intended for children, but has subtle adult  overtones, like the  Golden Compass, by Pullman.  But J. K. Rowlings  creation, is for the child, the child trapped in the adult and the adult.  This book has made more than one transition, not only it is pivitol to the  story line.  But it has created a new standard in child fiction that  writers will find hard to copy. This is an excellent book in and excellent  series, and if schools were smart it would be made required reading for  children.<br />I know that everyone who reads this book will agree with me in  saying that, 1. the next book should be 1,000 pages, 2. It should be  released very soon, 3. That the hype and media demand for that book will  break records, that makes this one set by book 4 seem pitiful.
