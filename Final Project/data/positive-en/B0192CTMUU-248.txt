I eagerly awaited this fourth book, and because J.K. Rowling can really tell a story well, I was not disappointed. That is a feat in itself, given all the hype and expectations surrounding this book. I personally miss  Harry playing Quidditch, and it's getting a little cumbersome to try and  catch readers up that haven't read the first three books, but these things  certainly don't detract from the book. There isn't much else I can say  without giving away the story, but in this readers's opinion (a 43 yr. old  adult), please ignore the hype and hoopla surrounding this book, just read  it, and enjoy the amazing, magical story.
