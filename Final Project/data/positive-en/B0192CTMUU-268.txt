Goblet of Fire (GoF) is drastically different from the first three Potter books in the maturity of both the characters and situations they fall into.  This book is the reality check of the Harry Potter series and it really shows how real Voldemort's character is.  There is also something to Trelawney's prophecy to Harry in book three -- a servant will return to his master... where exactly this leads the book, you are left to find out.  Tied with book 6 for my favorite, Goblet of Fire (GoF) begins to expose the level of connection of Harry and Voldemort.
