Harry Potter rides again, and the action is fast and furious and better than ever.  JK Rowling has a wicked sense of humor (her description of Harry's godawful, inflated Aunt Marge bouncing around the ceiling almost had me rolling on the floor), and in the Dementors, she has invented one of  the most frightening characters I've ever come across in children's or  adult literature, a being so implacably evil it will steal your very soul.  The series so far lives up to its original promise; it's a dizzying joyride  of fun, fantasy and escapism.  And as for the hopeless killjoys who claim  the books promote witchcraft and the occult: puh-leeze, how many children  turned into Satanists after reading &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; or  &quot;Snow White&quot;?  As well as JK Rowling's story, the overall design  of the books is wonderful, and the chapter illustrations by Mary Grandpre  are small gems in themselves.  I can hardly wait for July for some more  magical adventures when the fourth Harry Potter hits the bookstores. (Now  if somebody could tell me where to get hold of a real Firebolt...)
