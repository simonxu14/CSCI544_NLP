I was afraid that a book this long would be repetative and lacking substance. I was wrong. The book moves along with each page and trying to trim any of the content would have been hard. The book starts out as usual at the Dursleys house, and then moves on to Harry's 5th year at Hogwarts. Unlike past books, Harry is now a full blown teenager with gripes and attitude (just like my own 15 year old). He's not the big hero on campus this year-he's the laughing stock. The wizard's local paper has dubbed him a "nutter" and even his bunkmates are unsure of whether to believe his story about Voldemort. This installment has another evil character for Harry and his friends to contend with each day-Prof. Umbridge. This character is the essence of all that is evil in government intervention in people lives-especially education. As an special needs educator, I saw parallels to how our own government tries to impose its idea of a perfect education. This new twist in bringing in social controversy into her fantasy world gives the book a whole new dimension. One that is full-bodied and rich. J.K. Rowling has grown from the other books along with Harry and is allowing her readers the chance to be transported into the world of fantasy, but with the tip of the broomstick touching into the real world so that we can all find ourselves in the story.<br />Now that summer is here and the kids are out of school. Enjoy all 870 pages. You'll probably end up wishing there were more.
