This book is &#34;Outstanding&#34; and &#34;Exceeds Expectations&#34;!  The artwork is amazing and the quantity of it surprised me. Like others have said, it makes me feel like I did when I read it for the first time. And that is probably the best experience I ever felt reading a book. And I was in my 30s in 1999 when I first read it.
