Fabulous story, well written. J. K. Rowling creates a wonderful world with colorful characters. Her prose is so well detailed that you feel right at home at Hogwarts School of witchcraft & wizardry.<br />I read all 7 books with my daughter & now I'm reading them to my grandsons.<br />I recommend this book for kids & adults.
