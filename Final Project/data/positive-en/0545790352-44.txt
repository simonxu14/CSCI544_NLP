This book is a must-have for any Harry Potter fan. It’s the exact same book (unabridged, full, word-for-word version) as the original, but it’s complete in a larger size and with dozens of BEAUTIFUL, vibrant, colorful illustrations that really help to bring the wizarding world to life. Not only is it so great to have as a collector’s item, but it’s the perfect version for children to read. The text is a little larger, and while the illustrations aren’t on every page, they really add a lot of beauty to an already amazing book.<br /><br />This hardcover edition is complete with illustrated book jacket and woven-in fabric bookmark (not that you will ever need to use it, as it’s very hard to put this book down!)<br /><br />I am really looking forward to the other books being completed and released, although I’m not sure how they’ll fit some of the longer books into one illustrated book, as the first is one of the shortest books, and this version is already quite thick for a large hardcover book at its size.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this version for any Harry Potter fan or for any child just starting to read the series. The illustrations really take the already magical world of Harry Potter to the next level of something truly special, and at this price, who could beat it?
