Sirius Black was the right hand of You-Know-Who and was in Azkaban, a jail where nobody EVER escapes.  Until he escaped.  Where will he go?  Well, there are two clues to that.  The first is that Black's downfall was when Harry Potter defeated his master.  Also, in his sleep, he was overhead to say - He is at Hogwarts.  He is at Hogwarts.<br /><br />Now Harry is the center of a manhunt.  Will Black kill Harry before he is captured or are things a tad more complex than that?<br /><br />Loved the fact that Mrs. Rowling uses real legends and myths, such as Radcaps of Scotland and Kappas from Japan, yet also adds her own ideas, logic and humor.  New characters and old ones help give us a sense that we know and belong on the grounds of the school.  Yet this book is even darker than the first two and I didn't enjoy it as much.  Maybe reality is starting to slip into the world of Harry Potter?
