While I may not be a fan of all the individual illustrations, as a whole they capture the magic of the book.  I have been a fan of these books for the last fifteen years and the movies never captured the books for me.  I love that the illustrations were true to the book, and do not seem to be influenced by the movies.  It makes the book nerd in me happy.  Additionally I love that the things that are illustrated are not  the things I would choose.  It shines through the book that the illustrator is a fan of the books, and has a knack for detail.
