I'm not quite out of intermediate Japanese yet, but I can understand about 1/4 of it without a dictionary or the english version. I showed it to my professor and she said that it would be great for reading practice and getting short form through my head. From what I can tell, the translation is really accurate. I'm so excited to read this book!
