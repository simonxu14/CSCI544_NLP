This book is ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!! If you are a Harry Potter fan, I don't care how many times you've read the books or watched the movies, you NEED this book! The illustrations in this book are amazing and make you feel like you are apart of the stories. I love all the Harry Potter books but this one is now my favorite and I have already pre-ordered the next one because I loved this one so much! With the pictures I have even gotten my 9 & 12 year old reading this series with me!
