I was impressed by Rowling's latest entry into the Potter canon!  For the first time the kids seem like real kids with emotional outbursts, sulky moments and petty fights.  Everyone got along so well (in the group of friends of course -- we'd have to exclude the odious Draco, Crabbe et al) in previous books that I'd sometimes wonder when we'd see any real middle school behavior!  The last 100 pages are clearly the most gripping part of the book, but there are many excellent moments leading up to the grand finale.  Lots of clever bits as usual (I love the O.W.L.S. and NEWTS and the secret room that knows what you need -- don't we all need one of these!) and fun side plots (the Weasley brother's joke business and Hagrid's misadventures) that keep you glued.  If you're already a fan, there's nothing not to like.  For the newly initiatiated, you'd have to be completely devoid of imagination not to enjoy the ride.  Kudos to Rowling for keeping her standards high.
