I plan to see the movie tomorrow. This has whetted my apitite as well as leaving me agog at the imagination and attention to detail that went into this screenplay.<br />Of course, it doesn't read like a novel!  It is a different medium, with its own conventions and possibilities. I enjoyed it immensely and recommend it to anybody who enjoyed the Harry Potter movies.
