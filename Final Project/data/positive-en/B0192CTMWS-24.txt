I have to give Rowling credit: she really understands how to structure the books so you can't put them down.  Just as you reach the end of a chapter (and, therefore, a logical breakpoint), she sucks you right into the next one.<br /><br />I re-read the series to compare the books to the movies.  I think I like the books better than the movies, especially  this one.  She did an excellent job of tying up the loose ends.  The movie had a lot of questionable subjects: like when Harry is using the Resurrection Stone, why weren't Tonks and Fred present, since Lupin was (answer: they weren't germain to telling the tale.)<br /><br />The only problem I have with the series is that the first book needs to have a stronger binding.  Each time a new book came out, I went back and re-read all the books.  So I've read Sorcerer's Stone over 10 times now, and the binding has split. The other books are still intact. I tend to treat my books very gently, so it isn't a matter of abuse, it's a matter of overuse. But they are very enjoyable.
