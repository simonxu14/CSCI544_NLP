This morning at 0200, I finished &quot;Harry Potter and theGoblet of Fire&quot;.  My first warning to the reader is do not startthis book when there's a chance you'll be close to the end at bedtime. You WILL stay up until you're finished and dream about it all night!<br />This book is the much anticipated fourth book in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series by J.K.  Rowling.  The other three books have been on the best-seller list for months.  Needless to say this is the much anticipated publishing event of the year.  Surely with all the hype the book itself must be something of a letdown.....<br />WRONG!<br />It's the best book of the series.  In it we see Harry in his fourth year at Hogwarts.  During this year, he grows even more as a adolescent.  As he grows so do his lifes challenges. The pacing of the book is excellent.  Ms. Rowling never lost me for an instant.  She also adds considerable depth and texture to Harry's world.  Questions are answered from the previous books in the series as well as new asked in the new book.<br />I've told you as much as I can without spoiling any of the plot elements.  Get your copy ASAP!
