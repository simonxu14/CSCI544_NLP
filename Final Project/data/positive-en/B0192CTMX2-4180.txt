I thought Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows provided a very satisfactory ending to the series. Everything was tied up beautifully. I enjoyed how Rowling added a lot of depth to a lot of characters, especially in how she re veals that Dumbledore was not perfect by any means. All in all, a great book (one that I read in one sitting :-) ).
