This fourth installment vastly exceeds expectations, keeping readers guessing until the end!  Rowling never loses a thread in this tapestry and weaves them- dare we say- magically together for a brilliant end.<br />However, as anticipated, this volume is much darker its  predecessors.  I am not entirely sure of its suitability for small  children.  At risk of spoiling any surprises, (which are well worth waiting  for), let me just say the book does not end with the same &quot;good  triumphs over evil&quot; euphoria as the previous Harry Potter books.<br />The  beginning of the boy/girl factor is brilliantly done- and you will be  surprised at where romance blossoms.<br />If you are expending energy trying  to guess who dies- stop- you are wasting your time.  When reading the book  gives no hints until it actually, and sadly, happens.<br />For such a long  book, it is a very quick read.  I found myself reading faster and faster,  desperate to find out what happened next!  I hope you all enjoy it as much  as I did.  The only part I hated was finishing it and realizing how long it  will be until number five.
