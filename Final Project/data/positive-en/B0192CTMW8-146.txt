After reading the first book I knew I had to read the next three. You really can't go wrong with any of these Harry Potter series. This book covers the life of Harry Potter in his second year at Hogwarts, school of witchcraft and wizardry. It makes you love the characters more than before and the plot is simply beautiful and creative. I don't want to ruin it for you, but I guarantee if you liked the first, you will really love this one. Make sure you read the first book before you read this one.<br />This book is a great escape from the stresses of life. I would recommend to everyone. Enjoy!
