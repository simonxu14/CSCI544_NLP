I, unfortunately, bought this as a gift for my niece. I say unfortunately because I wanted it the second I held this fantastic specimen in my clammy hands. I secretly kept it on my bookshelf, thinking I could pass off a used candle as an appropriate gift for a 5 year old, saying it was a 'hold over' until the book came in. Fast forward to my sister finding the book on display in my apartment and queue my quiet sobs as she left with it tucked under her undeserving, cold, muggle-arm.<br /><br />Beautifully done and holds enough magic to successfully rid your wardrobe of a boggart. JK, the boggart is still my sister with MY book clutched in her hands and I can't get rid of it. BRB, crying. Thanks a lot, niece.
