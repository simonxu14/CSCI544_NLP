This by far was the best book of the Harry Potter series.  Everything is finally tied together in Book 7, and it was a great finish to a wonderfully detailed story line.<br /><br />For those of you who are unsure of having your children read these books, do not be put off by the "magic".  The cold hard truth is that there really is a battle of good and evil in the world, and good always wins. As with anything you need to talk to your child and explain the difference between fantasy and reality.<br /><br />Harry Potter is a character who stands up for what he believes in, shows loyalty to those he loves, and teaches readers about strength and courage and integrity.  There are alot of great lines that Dumbledore has said, the general idea of which is that love is the greatest force in the world.<br /><br />Great lessons for every age!
