People laugh when I say Harry Potter is the best series I have ever read.  I am an avid book nut, but I swear that it is true.  I understand it seems strange for a grown woman to love a children's series, but I do.  I couldnt wait to finish this series to find out how it ended, but sobbed when it was over because I knew I would never have that experience again. I have turned many people into Potter fans, and not one has regretted my efforts. Read it, read it read it. Young or old, this is a truly touching, deep story.
