To be honest I was not sure what to expect when I read The Deathly Hallows...  It is really dificult to wrap up such a brilliant, long-running series as Harry Potter properly.  It turns out my fears were unfounded, as the book is not only brilliant, but highly satisfying.  I think most fans of the series will be quite happy with the book from cover to cover.  Kudos to J.K. Rowling for producing such a imaginative fantasy world and allowing millions of people, young and old (like me) to enjoy.  Highly recommended to all Potter fans.
