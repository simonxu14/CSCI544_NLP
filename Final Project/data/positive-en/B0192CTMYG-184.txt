Who would have known a story about a little boy living under a cupboard named Harry Potter would become an international best-seller?  HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCER'S STONE is the first novel in a 7 book series that introduces the reader to an amazing world of magic.<br /><br />The novel begins with Harry living with his aunt and uncle, the Dursleys.  Ever since Harry was dropped off at the Dursley's front doorstep 10 years ago, the Dursleys along with their hefty son, Dudley, have made his life almost unbearable.  It is not until a letter arrives, written with emerald-green ink, addressed for Harry Potter--The Cupboard under the Stairs--does Harry's life begin to radically change.<br /><br />That's when a giant named Hagrid visits Harry and reveals to him, against the wishes of the Dursley's, that he is a wizard.  After Harry purchases all his school material from Diagon Alley, he leaves platform nine and three-quarters straight to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

Woops, I didn't say that!<br /><br />The reader, for the first time, is teased in this novel with such unforgettable characters and stunning ideas that become much more prominent as the series plays out: Hogwarts, Dumbledore, Voldemort, Quidditch, Professor Snape, Professor McGonagall, Draco Malfoy, the Invisibility Cloak, Gryffindor, etc.<br /><br />J.K. Rowling's writing ability, imagination, and intuitive grasp of human nature gives her characters a depth that resonates in the core of the reader.  Harry, along with his best friends, Hermione and Ron, are so in tune, emotionally intact with one another that it makes the story so much more alive.
