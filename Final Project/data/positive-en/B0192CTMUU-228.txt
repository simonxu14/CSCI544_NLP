J.K. Rowling does it again--the same fine descriptive prose, exciting action, amazing monsters, page-turning climax, and of course, a gentle lesson at the end.<br />As you all know, someone does indeed die but it's not  who you expect.  As usual, someone close to Harry attempts to hurt him, and  as usual it's not who you expect. And with the nasty turn of events near  the end you might expect the tone to become dark.  It remains hopeful and  courageous to the finish.<br />The gratifying thing about this series is that  it keeps getting better--you won't be disappointed in Goblet of Fire; in  fact you'll be glad that it's almost 750 pages so it will last at least a  few under-the-sheets-with-the-flashlight nights.<br />How long do we have to  wait for the next one?
