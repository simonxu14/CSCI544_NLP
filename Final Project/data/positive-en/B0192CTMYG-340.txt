The last movie in what has been a huge part of my life is coming out in 5 days, so about a month ago, I decided that I would reread the whole series, in the hopes of falling in love with the magic all over again. It was then that I realized that I had hardcover versions of every book except the first. So of course, I hopped on Amazon, ordered this book and it arrived promptly [the next day]. I've read all except the last book at this point, and if there's one thing that I can say, it's that Harry Potter has changed my life.<br /><br />If you're here looking for a review of the story, just know this. Read the book. Allow yourself to be moved by the magic and use the magic to move those around you. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you may fall in love. Just read.
