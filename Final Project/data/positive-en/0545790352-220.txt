Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone - J.K. Rowling - The Illustrated Edition.<br /><br />  My wife and I have read all the Harry Potter books as they were published. Somewhere we have a stack of those books - fondly remembered but without any motivation to retread those stories until...I saw the new illustrated edition.<br /><br />  My old Scholastic paperbacks were mass produced on inexpensive paper - were practical and served their purpose adequately.<br /><br />  The illustrated edition - art work by Jim Kay - is a handsome book in so many respects. It an oversized hardbound 9 x 11 - with many striking full page color illustrations that bring the Sorcerer's Stone story to life - oh yes it has a sewn in red cloth bookmark. This book is beautiful to look at and the wonderful illustrations are true to the spirit of the story.<br /><br />  I could not resist buying the book and we are now motivated to re-read this wonderful story. I pre-ordered the next book - &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; and intend to purchase the entire series. Someday they may make a treasured gift to a grandchild but for now we will enjoy them.
