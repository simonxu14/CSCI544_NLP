I enjoyed lots of details of the book. I mostly liked how Harry lived with his mean uncle and aunt and his cousin named Dudley but then something special happens to Harry and he finds out he is a wizard and has a mom witch and a dad wizard who died from Lord Voldemorts spell or the who must not be named. Harry goes to Hogwarts his first day and becomes best friends with Ron and Hermione. I loved learning spells in the book. I love how Harry thinks snape is trying to kill him but then Harry finds out professor Quirrel is teaming up with lord Voldemort. This book had great, loving quotes from Dumbledore and he taught me a lesson at the end of the book.<br />  There was a confusing little part I didn't like about the book. I didn't like how Professor Quirrel seemed not at all suspicious but then for a suprise at the end of the book it turns out to be Quirrel but in the movie it does point out how suspicious Quirrel is being but overall I loved the book and you should read it!<br />  I think people who love mysterious and magic will love reading this book. For those people who dream of being a witch or wizard like me and love to memorize spells will absolutely love this book!
