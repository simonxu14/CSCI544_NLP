Although overly long, the extra space is given over to character development of interest, and some exposition. Though not enough exposition to bore the reader. With this added space we get to see some old favorites return, and some great new characters.<br /><br />  The tone is dark and confused, Harry is an angry young man as he deals with his encounter with Voldemort alone and with no support other than the Dursleys. Harry finds the truths of his world on shaky ground as Hogwart's comes under the dominion of a particularly hideous Defense Against the Dark Arts teach, and later acting headmaster, Umbridge. Harry and Dumbledore find themselves under an attack on both political, personal and public relations fronts as the ministry of magic attempts to squash their belief in the return of Voldemort.<br /><br />  On top of this, our angry Harry feels overly protected by Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix and wishes to be allowed to do something, anything. Seeing his friends excel in various activities of school causes him both joy, and anguish, depending on his mercurial mood.<br /><br />  Eventually Harry begins teaching a select group of students Defense Against the Dark Arts and a wonderful new character, Luna Lovegood, joins the core group of friends. Luna was a great surprise, a placid, self-assured, calm free-spirit. She brings a nice calming balance to the core group of otherwise hyper individuals.<br /><br />  The first 100 pages in Sirius Black's house allow us to see Professor Lupin, Black himself and the real Mad Eye Moody who have all returned as well as a few other new characters on the side of Voldemort.<br /><br />  At the culmination of the book, not only has Harry grown, but the other core group and incredibly the Weasley twins fulfill their potential in a completely plausible and heroic way.<br /><br />  Despite the length, the pacing is pretty much perfect, I kept reading all night long until finished. There are a few dragging spots, mostly due to Harry's adolescent rages being overdone. Even with that though, the book is brilliant and far and above the others in the series, and should rank amongst the classics of the genre.
