I'd rate as high as I could! This is the best book in the series, which considering each books' quality is really saying something! Harry, Ron, and Hermione have aged so well, and (CAUTION, SPOILERS!!!) the argument in the woods where Ron walks out on the group is a marvelous stroke of storytelling genius, where J.K. Rowling really keeps her writing in tune with the character's personality. As for the names of Harry and Ginny's children...what a beautiful sentiment. Lily, James, and... Albus Severus!! I want to name my kid that. :) A perfect end to a fantastic series...we will miss Harry, but for the rest of my life copies of all 7 books will be well-loved and cherished until they are past on when I do.
