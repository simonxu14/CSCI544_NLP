When the first Harry Potter book went on sale, I purchased the softcover edition. I didn't know whether I would enjoy a "children's book" enough to buy the next one in the series. Once I opened the book, however, I hated to put it down when I had to stop reading. I have continued to pre-order the hardcover editions as soon as they were available, so to make a matching set, I recently purchased a harcover edition of "...The Sorceror's Stone." I am an old lady, 69 this year, a blogger and a self-published author of my own fantasy story. I love Rowling's writing, though I am sometimes surprised at how dark and dangerous the plot can become. But her readers are not to be coddled: bad things do happen, and they can't always be fixed by "magic." The first book in the Harry Potter series is a must-have, in my opinion, especially if you joined the readership late or have only seen the movies.
