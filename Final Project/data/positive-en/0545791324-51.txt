I love that these books are happening and, like the first, I loved this one. The images are beautiful and I can't wait to someday read these to my own children.<br /><br />My book arrived late and was damaged. Amazon was quick to replace the book, but were very adamant about the item being returned so they could try to sell it again. I requested that they let me donate it to my sister-in-law's elementary school library. I wish that Amazon would be more philanthropic with their damaged, but usable, books. Maybe require a donation receipt in place of the return so that they know that the customer isn't just doing what Amazon is planning to do and resell it. Even if they used them to start their own library somewhere. These books are so wonderful and should be shared with as many children as possible. I guess it is just the socialist in me hoping for a better world. :)<br /><br />Book was not damaged beyond use, but for my own collection, I wanted the quality I expect to receive.
