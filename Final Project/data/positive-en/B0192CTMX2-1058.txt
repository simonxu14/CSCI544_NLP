I have read all the Harry Potter books, but this was the first audio book<br />I have ever purchased. After hearing Jim Dale's interpertation of Rowlings<br />work I ordered the complete Harry Potter series on CD.<br /><br />You will find yourself totally involved in the story telling to the point<br />you don't want to do anything but just listen. Each character comes alive<br />with indivdual voices that make you feel you are part of the adventure. I<br />Also found I picked up things from the audio book that I missed while reading<br />the book. Very well done!
