Forget any negative reviews you've heard, if you're a Harry Potter fan, you're going to love this book. Once again J.K. Rowling has increased the maturity level of the book (writing as well as content) to match the fact that Harry himself is growing up and having to deal more with the adult world outside of Hogwarts. Things are more serious and yet there's still a great sense of fun about the whole thing.<br />Harry actually acts like an average 15 year old here, having the occasional bout of self-pity, mood swings and thinking about how life just isn't fair. Typical teenager and many reviewers found fault with that. But Harry should get to act like a teenager, he isn't perfect and we shouldn't expect that of him (too many people already do in his world).<br />So much happens in this book, and even if it is wrapped up in the end -- and some long-overdue justice delivered to a certain Slytherin's father -- it's not as tidy as in the first few books, but nor is it as frightening as the last one. We're left knowing there's still much more to come but this time it's on a far more uplifting note.<br />Like the rest of the Harry Potter books, you won't be able to put this one down and when you're finished with it you'll be anxious for more.
