I did not acutally start reading the books, but had see the movies, until Book 7 came out. I immediately ordered 1 & 7 from Amazon. Within 2 weeks, I had ordered all 7 books and my husband now read in the evening instead of TV. We are 42 and 45 and our youngest is almost 19 so it just goes to prove, Harry is not just for kids!!
