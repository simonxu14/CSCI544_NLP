I enjoyed reading it very much and I believe it measures up to the other books in the series, but I don't think it surpasses any of my expectaions.  As I read this book I found myself missing the earlier books in the series, because they were easier to follow and did not involve tons of sidetracking events and dry filler.  Much like the other later books in the series, Deathly Hollows has some dry spells in it that you need to force yourself through to get to the good stuff.  Also, much like the later books, the last few chapters provide too much information and excitement to absorb in one read through.  Loose ends come together too fast to be appreciated and sometimes events in the last hurried chapters bring up more questions than answers.  I have to admit there were things that were touched upon in this book that I thought would be significant later, but were never mentioned again.  Some feelings of closer were lost because of this.  One thing I was not expecting was the fairytale ending.  I personally feel this was done to please the readers, but it was quite predictable.  Even having said all of this, I still enjoyed the book overall and will start to read all of them again as soon as possible.
