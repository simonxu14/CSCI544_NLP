This is the best series in the world. The writing is very descriptive and the author make the book appear to be written from a 13 year olds point of view. You can feel the excitement during the games or the suspense just as a teacher rounds the corner and they are almost caught. I cannot wait for  the rest of the series to come out...these first three books were so good,  I read them all in 2 days!
