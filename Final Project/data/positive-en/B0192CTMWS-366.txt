Now THIS is the way to end a series!  The darkness and sense of foreboding that has been building comes to a dramatic end (no point in skipping ahead ... things are revealed gradually as you proceed through the book), the entire cast of characters from the previous books make an appearance (in one capacity or another), plenty of plot twists keep you on their toes, questions and gaps in the plot from the previous 6 books are all neatly tied together, and an epilogue shows us what happens "after."  You can't ask for a classier way to end things.<br /><br />The ending is bitter-sweet: it is sad that the series has come to an end, but J.K. Rowling has done a truly magnificient job in concluding things - all questions are answered, depth and details of the past are revealed, and justice prevails.  Thank you, J.K. Rowling - its been a treat to follow the story.
