This is an excellent book, the first that ever got my attention as an adult.  JK Rowling is such a good writer.  But if you would like to save yourself over 700 pages, watch the movie.  It is close to the book.  Also, not sure why the artwork on all the books looks like it was drawn by a primary school student.
