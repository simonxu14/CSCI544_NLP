I bought this audio book for my family and also my father because he travels quite a bit in his pick up. We have loved this audio book as has my dad, the only problem is that the coloring on the actual CDs is such a pale orange it's nearly impossible to tell what CD number it is, and obviously you can't see it while driving at all. I ended up writing the disc numbers on the packaging, as well as which discs were in which sleeves so I could see it at a glance. The voice actor does an excellent job, we have listened to this audio book probably 8 times in the last two months.
