For a first novel, I have to say that J K Rowling really knows how to glue her readers to her story. The characters are believable, the story is just excellent, especially the miror of erised chapter which is probably one of the best in the whole series.<br /><br />Not only is it a great book, but we get to see how Jo Rowling started plotting her whole series and we get to see all the little clues and details that eventually not only influence the future books, but also important elements coming back in the last chapters of the series.<br /><br />A great beginning for a great author.
