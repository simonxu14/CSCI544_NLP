When I picked up Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire for the first time, I was overjoyed, thinking that this time, it was long enough that I would be able to take a nice long time reading it, so that I would have less days to  wait for a brand new Harry Potter book to read. I was very, very wrong.  I  finished the book in less than one day, because once I started I could not  stop. I have considered J.K. Rowling an outstanding writer ever since I  first read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, but she did even better  with this 4th book, something I did not think possible.  With many of the  books I read, I find myself counting pages until the end, but with this  book, I was so hooked that I never wanted it to be over.  It is  considerably darker and more frightening than the other 3 books, but it is  still humourous in many parts, and very exciting.
