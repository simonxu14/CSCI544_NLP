I bought this for as a gift for my sister who loves Harry Potter, but hasn't taken the time to read the books.  The set came timely and in great condition!  Also the price was the best I've seen for these audio books.  My only complaint is that the t-shirt wasn't included, which the seller stated before I made the purchase.  It's okay though; I guess 27 is a little old for a Harry Potter shirt!
