My son asked me for this book for Christmas. He enjoyed reading the series when he was younger and he now feels that his son is ready to have this read to him and the illustrations and hard cover will keep this copy around for many years to come!! I can't wait to hear what my grandson says about the story and he and his Dad start reading the book together!! This delivery was delayed due to sell out.. but arrived in great shape only about 2 weeks later than planned!!
