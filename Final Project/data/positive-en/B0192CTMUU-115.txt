My 9 year old granddaughter and I are reading this together two days a week. She is a huge Harry Potter Fan and also belongs to a Harry Potter Book club at school. The print on the page is a little smaller than I would have liked for our reading along but the story is so much fun! We have not finished this book but anticipation for the next chapter is always exciting for her and she often wants us to read &#34;just a little longer&#34; each day!
