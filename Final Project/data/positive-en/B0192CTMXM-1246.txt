Once again,very entertaining..this last book to the sequel is just as good as the previous six! I finished book 6 w/ so many questions and this book answered them all and then some. Wonderful and sad all at the same time. Hate to see J.K. Rowling wrapping up the story,but very pleased w/ this book! Happy Reading....hope you enjoy this book as much as I did!
