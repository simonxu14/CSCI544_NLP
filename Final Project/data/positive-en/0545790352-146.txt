Love this book.  I recently bought it for my 3 month old daughter.  I cannot wait for her to experience the joys of the magical world.  This will be one of our nightly bedtime reads when she gets a little older.  The illustrations are beautiful, and match the descriptions of the book (unlike somethings in the movies).
