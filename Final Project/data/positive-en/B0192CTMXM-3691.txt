After resisting reading the books for years, i finally gave in. i was immediately hooked. the voice characterizations are wonderful and familiar across the entire series. this final audio production did the story justice. it is a wonderful and redemptive story, and it was a joy to walk with Harry from the beginning through to the very last word.
