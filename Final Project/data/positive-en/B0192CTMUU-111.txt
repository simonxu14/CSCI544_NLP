I'm a real Harry Potter fan (although I'm not a kid anymore). This book is a sequale of her previous books (of course). It's different from the first three books since our Harry gets older and begins to be more emotional. But  still, it shouws a lovely friendship between Harry, Hermione and Ron.  Although they all grow up and begin to think about boys and girls as  &quot;boys and girls&quot;, their friendship and the caring for one another  is still be the same and this theme makes me happy all the time I read this  book.. Recommended!
