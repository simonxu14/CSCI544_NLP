J.K. Rowling delivers again! This book was a great read, but very different from the past. Firstly, Harry is one angry guy in this book. Definitely a typical teen. This book is alot darker than the other ones. The new defense against the dark arts teacher is the best villain since Lord Voldemort. Her scenes with Harry are great. Alot of the time you will be wondering where Rowling is going with certain things, but its all explained in the end. I enjoyed the fact that Neville Longbottom is a much stronger character in this book, and not so much of a loser. Rowling goes into more detail in this book about things she just glossed over in the others, such as Harry's relationship with Cho Chang, What happened to Neville's parents at the hands of Lord Voldemort, why Professor Snape hates Harry so much, and Sirius Blacks life before he went to Askiban. As for the "big secret" of who dies. I am not going to spoil it. Let's just say that it wasn't who I expected, but it made sense in the story. This book won't disappoint. I read it in 12 hours, and did little else!
