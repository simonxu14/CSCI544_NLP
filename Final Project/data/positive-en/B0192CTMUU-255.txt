This book is great, possibly my favorite, because for once things are not quite so perfect for Harry. In the previous books, everything seemed to work out almost unbelievably. In this book, we see more pain, more surprise, and a bit more "darkness", as J.K. Rowling intimated. There's a great game of Quidditch, with international celebrity players. And of course the focus of the book is the Tri-Wizard Tournament which is at times funny and scary. In fact, some parts of this book may be a bit much for younger readers.<br /><br />Overall, a great Harry Potter book and I can't wait until the movie comes out.
