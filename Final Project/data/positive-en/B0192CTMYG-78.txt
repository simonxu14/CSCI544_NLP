This is one of my favorite books in the Harry Potter series! I have read all of the books 6 times each and now the first,(Sorcerer's Stone) and last,(Deathly Hallows) twice. (I read them out of order now.) I especially love how you can read the books again and notice things that you haven't noticed before! Sometimes things that lead up to something else or things that happened in other books because of something that happened in this book! I love this book specifically because of the way it introduces you to Harry's awful lifestyle! It makes you feel so bad for him and it makes you connect with him. Especially if you have an aunt or uncle or someone in your family who is not particularly nice to you! So thank you J.K. Rowling for this amazing book! And the rest of the series! I can't wait for "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child!"
