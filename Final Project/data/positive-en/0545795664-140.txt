It's a very neat book, for those who are just starting to play the game or have no interest in going deeper into moves and other strategies for their Pokemon.<br />Pros: Good pictures, Tells you their type, All Mega Evolutions thus far included, Has a possible move list.<br />Cons: All Pokemon are in alphabetical order instead of evolution, generation, or region, Does not show what level the Pokemon will evolve or what you need to evolve said Pokemon, No real tips or strategies to make Pokemon the best they can be.<br />For the price as of right now it was a good deal. It is a good book for older kids or those who are just starting the Pokemon Series. The price is a good deal for a fun add to any Pokemon collection!
