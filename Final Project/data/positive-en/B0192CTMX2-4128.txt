This book was the exciting and expected end to the wonderful Harry Potter series. When I first began reading this series I was not sure that I would care for it all the much but I definately didn't expect to love it. JK Rowling does a great job of showing the ins and outs of friendship, growing up and learning right from wrong. This last book, was in my opinion, the best by far. I loved the other ones but this one answered all the questions that had been lingering through the series. I love that the author took little tidbits from the previous books and made them important as she has done all along. I love the humor that comes naturally along with the battle and the struggle of good and evil. I don't want to say anything to spoil the book for others but I just couldn't put it down. I would recommend it to anyone and have already. Thanks, JK Rowling for such a wonderful adventure.
