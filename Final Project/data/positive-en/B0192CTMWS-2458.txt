I was so excited when I got this book...but so nervous I was almost afraid to open it! What was going to happen? I had speculated for so long, I was almost afraid to find out. The story delivered! There were nailbiting moments as Harry and company invaded the ministry of magic, and the sadness of Hogwarts without Dumbledore. The final confrontation was spine tingling and frightening, but the triumph over Voldemort is worth every moment. JK Rowling ROCKS as a story teller and I can't wait to see what she conjurs up next!
