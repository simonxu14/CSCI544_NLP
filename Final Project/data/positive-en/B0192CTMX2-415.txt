The fact that the film adaptation is going to be split into two full-length feature films should tell you how much stuff is in this book, and how much the filmmakers wish to honor the amazing finale of J.K. Rowling's series. The book definitely deserves it, and you'll see why when you read it. Obviously make sure you have read all the other books in the series first, then embark on the journey for yourself.
