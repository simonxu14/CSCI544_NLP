I picked up this book, on a busy work day - my intention was to read the introduction and then set the book aside to read over the weekend..... the first chapter caught my attention and I could not put the book down.  I related to every single topic and before the end of the day, I had read the book cover to cover and then gone back over a number of the chapters.<br /><br />Colin has captured the essence of some very real business challenges and articulated incredibly well exactly how to overcome those challenges.<br /><br />Within days of reading this book, I made some big changes in my business - changes that needed to be made but I had been procrastinating on... the results have been astounding and my &#34;Sandpit&#34; is happier already.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who manages teams of people in fact, even if you simply interact with other people on a day to day basis, this book will benefit you.
