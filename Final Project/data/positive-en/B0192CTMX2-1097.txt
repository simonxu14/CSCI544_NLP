This book is a fitting ending to the series, and a page-turner. I was sorry to see some of the characters die...some were complete surprises, others I was expecting. The only thing that stuck out to me as a bit silly was the whole "you can't magic food" thing - that seemed strange to me, random, like it was added in to make Harry's struggle more difficult. Other than that, it's an excellent read, a modern psychological mytholology in and of itself, and one that's sure to last the ages.
