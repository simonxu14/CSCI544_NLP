I wasn't caught up in the initial hype over this series, but after seeing several of my kids and wife immensely enjoy these books I began to think maybe I should read them myself.  After having attended numerous Harry Potter themed parties from such occasions as a nearby city museum's Halloween party themed around Harry Potter to a surprise birthday party for a daughter, Harry Potter has been a fun theme that has brought fun and joy to numerous social occasions with my family and friends.  I finally began reading the Harry potter book series and find them as enjoyable as many of my favorite books from childhood like the chronicles of Narnia or the castle of Llyr.  Thanks mrs Rowling for bringing such joy to me and my family and providing an excuse for a great theme to build memories around!
