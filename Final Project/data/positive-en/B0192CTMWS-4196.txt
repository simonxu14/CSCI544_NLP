I ordered this book in advance and Amazon guaranteed the shipping receipt date. However, Amazon was unable to meet that date. I should be angry and livid, right? Wrong.<br /><br />Amazon notified me immediately that they were unable to get my copy to me by the date guaranteed and they are refunding the full amount of the book. I'm delighted with the service that Amazon provides! I have been relying on them for several years now for most of my gift giving and personal shopping needs. This only further enhances my opinion of them.<br /><br />As to the "...Deathly Hallows"...? Gripping, chilling, and thrilling are three great adjectives to use describing it. I believe it is a fitting ending to a wonderful series. Rowling has done her level best to not cheat the readers and to reward them for their dedication and alligience.<br /><br />I won't say more since so many others have elaborated far more extensively.<br /><br />However, since this is an Amazon review site, I thought my purchasing experience with this eagerly anticipated book warranted praise as well as the fine tome which I've only just completed.
