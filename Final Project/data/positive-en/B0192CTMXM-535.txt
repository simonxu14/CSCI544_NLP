The evolution of these series has gone from naive and maniqueist utopia to dark dystopia. As the world of magic seems to resemble more and more the world it inhabits (since we are all muggles, that is our world), a subtextual (an sometimes not so hidden discussion) emerges about class, race, slave labor and corruption. Since the second book, where we heard for the first time the racial slur "mudblood", this has become the center of the main conflict of the series. Race relations, racism and the pretense of purity are at the heart of the confrontation between the forces of good and evil. It is no surprise that this topic which is painfully present in the political debates all over Europe (with its history of Nazism and the resurgence of a Neo Nazi movement) has become the underlying conflict of the series. For the first time, the sorting hat gives us the real dirt on what lies behind the house divisions at Hogwarts, and it is racism what it talks about. As always, the humor is there, we even find ourselves in the presence of a tabloid newspaper "The Quibbler" which is no better than our muggle tabloids, and with it a parody, too close for comfort, of the role of the media, which had begun to take form also in "The Goblet of Fire".<br />I particularly recommend a close reading of the description that Sirius Black does about his family and the family ties among the wizards. Nobody reading that chapter can escape the sensation that the analogy with the nazi philosophy is just below the surface.<br />I certainly think that adults should read this series, because there is much to be discussed there, and much to be learned. I am glad that the Dickensian aspect of Rawling's series has gone beyond the most obvious traits and into a discussion of our society and what we have inherited from our recent past.<br />Bravo!
