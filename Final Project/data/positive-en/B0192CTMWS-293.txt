Having fallen in love with Harry Potter several years ago, of course I had my copy of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix fedexed to my home on that Saturday. Once in my hands I did not stop except for sleep until I had finished the "much too short" saga of the fifth year at Hogwarts. As everyone has pointed out, it is a tough year for Harry. He is in a dark mood and events do not go his way. There are many wonderful things, however, my favorite being the revisiting of the Pensieve which Dumbledore loans to Snape and which permits Harry to have new insights into his father's character. James is Harry's hero and like all fathers, he has flaws that Harry needs to accept and forgive in order to mature. Harry's relationship with Cho is totally realistic and again allows Harry to grow and mature. Rowling is a genius as no other writer for many years. Like others, I reread all four previous books so that I could "flow" into book 5. I only wish I had read it slower, but I will read it again soon and savor it next time, as soon as my husband finishes. In our family, there are four generations of us reading Harry Potter's story, the youngest is ten; the oldest is ninety. We can't wait until book six appears.
