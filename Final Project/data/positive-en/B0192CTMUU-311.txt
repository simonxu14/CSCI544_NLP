Rowling is consistently brilliant.  She adds new characters, puts new spins on old favorites and allows the children (Harry, Ron and Hermione) to age into crushes, ambitions and rivalries.<br />Be warned, this is intense.  You know who is back and after Harry.  The danger is real. The stakes are  high.  A great read for kids and adults -- just like books 1-3.
