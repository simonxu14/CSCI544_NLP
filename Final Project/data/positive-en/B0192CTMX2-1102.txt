After finishing with the second book I stayed waiting for more, I wanted more, until I finally got this one... And was a thousand times much better, darker storyline, more excitment, for real fans or just for people who like to read I recommend this Book, like in the other books before it, you will go to a magical world filled with monsters and secrets, secrets that you will have to understand the hard way... and much more<br /><br />I give it 5 stars and as soon as you read it you'll see why
