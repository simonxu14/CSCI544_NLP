I sat down with this book the moment I got it and devoured it in one weekend, and it was time well spent. Harry and his pals are adolescents now, and the awkwardness of crushes and school dances rings true to the  reader's experience. The book is as packed with adventure as all the  others, and the end is even more thrilling, and a cliff-hanger to lead us  in to Book 5. Write faster, Ms. Rowling!
