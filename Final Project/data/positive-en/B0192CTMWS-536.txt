I love Harry Potter, and Rowling's latest episode has a lot of the same elements many of us have grown to love-the magic, wit and adventure-that permeated the first four books.  But she takes a big turn in Book Five.  She told us she would.  We were warned.<br /><br />OtP starts off shortly after Book Four leaves off. (Don't worry, no spoilers here!) The action strikes right at the beginning and the twists and turns kept my stomach churning until the end.  No long, slow buildup like the other books.  She wrote Book Five for the big screen, the chases and the special effects that we know are coming are still whizzing in my head.  And at 870 pages, it still seems to have gone all too fast.  But unlike the other books, everything goes nightmarishly wrong.<br /><br />Harry feels it, as does Hermione, Ron, and nearly everyone else.  The book is also full of adolescent angst and sarcasm.  Harry and friends also start to question authority and each other.  That makes them-to non-adolescents at least-a bit less enjoyable to be around.  They snap at each other (and their elders) like never before, and we begin to wonder whether the sun will come out and change everyone's mood.<br /><br />It does, in little doses.  Fred and George Weasley are up to their old pranks like never before.  This is their finest hour.  They turn their jokes into a kind of heroism in one of the most memorable scenes in the series.<br /><br />We also get to see a lot more of other characters that played bit parts before, like Ginny and Neville.  They help round out the universe along with a few more additions.  Rowling not only expands her magical universe geographically-we do see a lot of a magical place we haven't seen before--but also through characters, who are either new or develop more.<br /><br />With hormones raging in their veins, there is more romance than Book Four.  The who-is-seeing-who game Potter fans have been playing for three years since GoF is played out in the story as well.  Our friends have turned fifteen, and the romance roulette has begun.  While a lot occurs off-camera, Rowling will leave a lot of hearts pounding, albeit in (thankfully) PG fashion.<br /><br />Rowling also litters her story with some verbal zingers, usually in the mouth of Hermione aimed straight at Ron. There is not a lot of them, but they are well worth the wait. Just one more reason to love them and Rowling.<br /><br />The characters have grown and Rowling writes as if her audience has as well.  Not only is the book longer, but the book's narration has matured as well.  It still reads like a conversation, but little ones are going to have more trouble keeping up.  With more mature themes, they are less likely to be able to relate anyway.  This is a big departure from the first four books.<br /><br />The most important change is that now that Harry is getting older, he learns that knowing the magical world in an adult way is a heavy burden.  A constant theme in the book is that Harry wants to know what is going on.  But the deeper secrets he learns aren't easy.  And while the adults around him still try to protect him, he becomes painfully aware of how limited their power is.  As he grows more powerful, he also learns how vulnerable he is and those who around him are.  He faces death once again.  Its more painful now because its not just a memory from long ago, but its someone he knows and loves...and feels responsible for.<br /><br />Order of the Phoenix is darker and more powerful than any of the other four books.  But the adventure is more emotionally draining and less emotionally satisfying as well. (That might not be all fair, since I zoomed through the book, we'll see).  Potter fans used to fairly happy endings might not like the bittersweet conclusion.  But OtP does end with an action-packed whollop.  Rowling ties up all the ends by the last page, but OtP leaves us with a sense of looming danger.<br /><br />Despite the gloom it is still a world we love, and when we've left it we miss Harry, Ron and Hermione. Many of us miss them like friends, which is the lingering power of Rowling's storytelling.  I just hope its not three years until Book Six.
