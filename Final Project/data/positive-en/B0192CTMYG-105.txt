All of the Harry Potter books are four out of five stars for me.  They are very well-written books with elements of drama, suspense, action, mild horror, and tiny bits of humor here and their.  The books are a bit too long to be 100% to my liking, but I definitely like them a lot.  I know this might not be the most popular opinion, but I like the Harry Potter movies slightly more than I like the books.  While it's true that I don't exactly like the amount of parts of the books that were taken out in the move, that is indeed something that usually has to be done when making a movie based a lengthy novel.  What I like better about the movies is that they are shorter and therefore somewhat easier to follow.  I would recommend the Harry Potter books to just about anyone who is willing to read longer chapter books that are dramatic, suspenseful, and moderately scary.
