Product was in great condition, dust jacket in tact and no marks or tears. It was delivered on earliest delivery date, so I wasn't expecting it for another week and was pleasantly surprised! The shipping packaging was not good-it was in a simple envelope, no bubble wrap or box and no kind of extra protection. There was no damage in shipping, though, so I still rate the seller 5 stars.
