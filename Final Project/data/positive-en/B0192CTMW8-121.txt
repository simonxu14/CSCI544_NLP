This Harry Potter book was great. My brother and sister had been reading these books as well as many of my friends but I wasn't into them. After a few years I decided to pick up the first book and read it. After that I knew I was going to read the rest of the series. This book fit perfectly into the series and was an exciting read. I recommend it to anyone who likes to read books for pure enjoyment.
