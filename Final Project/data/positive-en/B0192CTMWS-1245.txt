I found this book to be the best Harry Potter book yet.  However, go through and read the others first so that you have a strong basis of the story lines in the previous books.  The book wraps up the Harry Potter story nicely and you won't be disappointed.  I would not recommend this book for anyone under the age of 13 because of the violence that occurs.
