As I was reading Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, I realized that there are quite a few things in the magical world that I am glad exist only in the magical world. I tried to think of things specifically from this book that I would love to have exist, and my list got very, very short. I think I’ll share them both with you. Enjoy!<br /><br />Magical Things from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets I Wish Were Real:<br /><br />Flying Ford Anglias<br /><br />Seriously, who couldn’t use a flying car every once in a while? I love love to have one of these. That invisibility button would also be awesome since then people wouldn’t even know where I was when I was flying across the country. This would also probably be cheaper than flying commercially. Okay, someone needs to make this a thing.<br /><br />House Elves<br /><br />So Dobby is a bit crazy but house elves could be extremely useful. Every bookworm could benefit from the services of one of these. They could clean up after us, make us food, and even bring us chocolate. I would be all for having a house elf, though I would treat my house elf better than Dobby was treated.<br /><br />Magical Things from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets I Am Eternally Happy Are NOT Real:<br /><br />Aragog and Family<br /><br />Anything that is ready to eat Ron, Harry, and Fang needs to not exist. Also, a spider the size of a small elephant sounds terrifying. I am glad these exist only in the world of dear Harry Potter. Though, now that I think of it, this would be a very good reason to avoid the Forbidden Forest forever.<br /><br />The Monster in the Chamber of Secrets<br /><br />Since I don’t want to spoil this for anyone who hasn’t read the book/seen the movie (do you even exist?), I will refrain from naming the monster. However, this monster needs to never exist in the world that I live in. I have no desire to know that something this creepy could truly roam unseen around a gigantic, medieval castle. If these exist, kindly refrain from telling me so.<br /><br />Tom Riddle’s Diary<br /><br />So, a creepy blank diary that writes back to you? No thank you. I full heartedly agree with Mr. Weasley that you should never trust anything if you can’t tell where is keeps its brain. Yep, this diary definitely falls into that category of things that shouldn’t be trusted, ever. Also, after reading the later books and knowing what the diary really was, I am so grateful that it does not exist in my world.<br /><br />Polyjuice Potion<br /><br />I have to say that this could, potentially, be handy sometimes. However, at most times, this would be terrible. Imagine never knowing exactly who you are talking to or spending time with. Especially in light of the fourth book, this potion is a terrible idea, at least in my opinion. I prefer to deal with people honestly and so this type of a potion does not sit well with me.<br /><br />This review fist appeared at Orandi et Legendi ([...]).
