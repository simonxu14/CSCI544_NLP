After the rather murky and somewhat actionless Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince, the last installment in the Harry Potter series moves along at a briskly satisfying pace.  Though most loose ends are tied up by the time readers reach the end and final battle between Voldemort and Harry, certain story threads are not, in this reader's opinion, sufficently explored--most notably the fate of the Malfoys, who appear to bow out of the story with little more than a whimper.  That, however, is mere nit-picking.  This books will be among fan favorites in the series and is certainly the best since the Goblet of Fire.
