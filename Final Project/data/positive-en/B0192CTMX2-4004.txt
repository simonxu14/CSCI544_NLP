Yes, I love Harry Potter books. Not that I think they are literary masterpieces, but still they entertain me immensely. I especially like the funny little details Rowling has created, like all the funny animals, foods, jokes...<br />This one is the most grown-up of the series so far, very dark from the beginning. (And by the way; I like this American edition more than the English one, the thick pages, the illustrations, the covers... Enjoyment also for your eyes and fingers!) And it also lingers more, giving hints, taking slowly closer to the real problems. POlitical plots and powergames, that affect the Hogwarts school are absolutely hilarious and accurate. Beware, children! This is just how stupid some of the adults really are!! Power should never be given to those who desire it most.<br />One thing gave me extra giggles: Professor Snape is played by Alan Rickman in the movies and somehow it seems, that Snape has become more like Rickman. And he has a bigger part than in the earlier books. Or is it just a coincidence, that Occlumency - a kind of mind-control - is taught by Snape, who is played by Rickman, whose best parts in earlier movies include Rasputin and Mesmer? When did Rowling get the idea of letting Snape teach it? And what made me wonder more, was that now Harry and others seemed to fly back when hit by magic - just like in the second movie - but earlier they giggled, grew extra limbs or did whatever the spell made them do. And didn't fly on their backs.<br />All in all I wasn't disappointed at all, though I'm not giving five stars. I think Rowling has still something better in store. And to tell the truth: I don't care for fantasy literature. Except Harry Potter.
