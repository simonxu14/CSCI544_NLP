I didn't think it would be possible to bring a close to the "Harry Potter..." series that would satisfy both those who foresaw Harry's death and those who prayed he would survive.  JK Rollings masterfully brought all of the frayed edges of her stories together and wove a remarkable tapestry of love and honesty.<br /><br />I'm a Christian theologian who has studied world religions, including Buddist, Hindu, Druid and Celtic history.  I'm amazed that the easy way Rollings layered her stories with mythology and contempory theology.  She is just one step away from Calvinism, but landed in the center of John Wesley's insistence upon personal choice rather than fate.  While I will one day read all of the stories to my grandchildren, I think that the discussions I have with my own children (now married) are even more satisfying.  We all love Harry, Ron and Hermione (and Ginny and all the others) and speak of them as though they are members of our family.  We are particularly impressed at how Draco's journey teeter-tottered between brash adolescent and frightened child.<br /><br />We will miss the intrigue of looking forward to another "Harry... book.  However, we find that the end, while bittersweet, was quite satisfying.  Thanks, JK.  You've expanded our minds and given us a real hero.
