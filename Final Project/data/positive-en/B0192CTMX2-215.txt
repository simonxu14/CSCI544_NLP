JKRowlings has written the perfect 7th book.  Put that together with the voice of all the Harry Potter books and you have what can only be the best possible "read".  Jim Dale once again brings each charactor to life in an extraordinary way , weaving the story with elegance and grace that puts you right in the middle of it.  I know that I will wear out my copies.  No Harry Potter fan should be without either the book or the CD's and for me it is both.  I would say more, but would hate to give anything away if one has not already indulged >
