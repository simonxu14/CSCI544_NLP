I bought the regular hardcover version of Deathly Hallows on the night when it first came out in July 2007. The book itself is possibly the most entertaining piece of literature you could ever encounter and is a stisfying ending to a remarkable series. I just purchased the deluxe edition a couple of weeks ago though. I was stunned to see Amazon selling it for under 9 dollars so I had to take the rare opportunity to get it at that price. Now I see Amazon has increased the price by over 30 dollars. With that in mind I wouldn't buy this book if you already have the standard edition of Deathly Hallows. Aside from the beautiful cover there is very little difference between the two. There is also a color illustration of Lucius Malfoy's peacock on high quality paper but other than that the only differences are the slipcase and full page illustrations of the chapter pictures. To me this doesn't justify the huge price difference between the two editions, but if you are a big fan and you simply want it for your collection I would reccomend trying to get it for a lower price. I think Amazon periodically brings the price way down.
