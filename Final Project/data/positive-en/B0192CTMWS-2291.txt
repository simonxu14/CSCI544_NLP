I don't want to spoil anything, but this book puts an end to the Harry Potter series and it does it in a spectacular way.<br /><br />There are valuable moral lessons on how to face death and on the intrinsecal mortality of the characters. Everybody can die in this book. Books III and VII are my favourites. Deathly Hallows must be read instantly following The Half-Blooded Prince; if you don't read it you'll forget about a lot of events from the previous book that are relevant to this one.<br /><br />I can't wait to see this book turned into a movie, the descriptions and the narrative are impressive.
