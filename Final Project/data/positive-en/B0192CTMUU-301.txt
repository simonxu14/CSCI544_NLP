I really enjoyed Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.  It's interesting to see Harry, Ron, and Hermione getting older and moving into adolescence.  Their magical abilities are also maturing.  The series definitely took a turn to the more serious side of things with this book.  The characters all  gain more depth and you get to know them better.  I enjoyed this a lot, and  am looking forward to the next book
