The biggest entry in the franchise is great. Some complain that it gets bogged down in the middle. I say it is character and plot development. Umbridge is one of the most effective villains I have ever come across. You will hate and love to hate her as you enjoy this book. As always it is the wonderful characters who populate this world that makes it all worth reading them.<br /><br />Also the scene between Harry and Dumbledore at the end is so gratifying.
