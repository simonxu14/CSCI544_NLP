It's Harry Potter's final year.  The story needs no review so I am just commenting on the physical book.  The book arrived brand new and still shrink wrapped, which is an excellent feeling opening a brand new book.  I baby my books and their bindings.  Wife on the other hand likes to use the floor as a book mark.<br /><br />Book arrived in no time and was in excellent shape.  Great story too, can't wait for the 2nd part of the movie.
