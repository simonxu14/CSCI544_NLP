Being an adult, I also recognize that most adults act like pre-teen and early teen children.  I felt that this book began getting into that aspect of the main characters lives in a way that was very engaging.  I'm glad so many people are reading these books and especially so children.  I highly recommend not only this one but the whole series (1-6).
