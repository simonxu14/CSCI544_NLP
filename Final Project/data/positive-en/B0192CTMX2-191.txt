Outstandingly crafted with a new twist at every turn! The Harry Potter series is a book that will definitely last for generations to come. I can't wait to watch the movies now and once the newest prequel, Fantastic beasts and where to find them, releases in theaters I am going to beg my parents to watch. I hope you or your children will think of this series the way I did!
