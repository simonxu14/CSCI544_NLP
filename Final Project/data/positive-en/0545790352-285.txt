Gorgeously made. The pictures are vivid, colorful, beautiful, and every other good word in existence. The print is a bit large.. I think it's meant for children, but that didn't stop me. I enjoyed reading this childhood favorite with a different perspective. It's something I'll be keeping until the end of time! Some of the pages do not have large artwork, but it leaves your imagination to determine the imagery. I prefer it that way. The book is sturdy, pages are thick, and I can't wait for the next one to come out!
