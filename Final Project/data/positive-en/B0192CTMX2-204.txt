Let me start by saying that I love all the Harry Potter books! That being said, I found the Prisoner of Azkaban lacking of some of the suspense and unpredictability of some of the other books in the series. What is very noticeable is the almost absence of Voltdemort who is constantly after Harry so there wasn't too much action between these wizards which is what I was looking for. I also found the very detailed Quidditch game description a bit boring although very well written.... None the less, the book is still very enjoyable!
