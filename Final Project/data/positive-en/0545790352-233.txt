This book is just icing on the cake, I'm not going to focus on the content of the book but the artwork (amazing book though). I love Harry Potter and was blown away by the artwork. I originally bought the book for a friend who is waaaay more artsy than I am and is starting to get into water colors. She loooooved the book, just stared at the pictures for a good hour when I gave it to her. Each painting is amazing. The artist sets the mood perfectly, whether it be humor, dark, curios, etc. The attention to detail blows my mind. I found myself catching all sorts of cute little things that made it's way into the picture.<br /><br />The artwork helped make an amazing book become more real in my mind.<br /><br />The book itself is very high quality. Thick pages and a sturdy cover. I also appreciated the book mark that came with it. I would not have figured such a high quality book would sell for $20
