This book is just wonderful.  It is large and beautiful. Many have read the Harry Potter books alone, but this delightful accomplishment invites the shared reading between parents and children.  My son grabs the book, jumps on my lap and says &#34;more, daddy.&#34; Where I thought to find a gift for my boys, I found a gift for myself as well.
