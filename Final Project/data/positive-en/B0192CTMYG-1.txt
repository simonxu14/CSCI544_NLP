This is a great, easy, relaxing way to keep up your already advanced Spanish.  It might also be a good way to greatly improve your intermediate Spanish.  Keep a dictionary and a notepad handy for those new vocabulary words.  Or don't.  After a little while of recording new words, I finally quit and just read for the pleasure of it, deciphering words by context.  Sometimes I grabbed the English version to check a phrase. That worked well, too.  In short, for use as a language builder and confidence builder, I highly recommend this book to you.  However, if you're hoping to comprehend the complexities of grammar, there are just enough strange turns of phrase in this book that I would say this is not your first source for grammar lessons.
