This book was ordered as a Christmas gift for my 23 year old grandson. His original was somehow lost and he needed this copy to complete his collection of first editions he had read as they were published.  Instead of searching though vintage bookstores, i ordered this copy online.  It was reasonably priced, arrived in perfect condition, and ontime for Christmas.
