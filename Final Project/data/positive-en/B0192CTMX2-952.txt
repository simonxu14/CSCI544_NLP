I keep expecting the quality of her work to fall off -- faced with the overwhelming pressure of millions of fans, deadlines, and a new family, but she doesn't disappoint!<br />I read the book in one sitting (fast reader, here) and was delighted, enchanted and left wanting more.  I'd like to pretend that I got the book for some younger relative, but the truth is I'm supposed to be an adult, and I still loved it.<br />Rowlings makes her characters believable by allowing them to grow up and face the angst of being a tweenager-- not quite child, not quite adult, that we all face -- but making it that "magical" time truly magical.  I will be eagerly awaiting #6 -- and hope it doesn't take another 3 years!
