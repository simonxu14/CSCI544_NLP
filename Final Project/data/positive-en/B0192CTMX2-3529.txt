Jim Dale is a Rock Star! It's absolutely incredible how he can switch so quickly to do a unique voice with emotion for every single character. Even if you've read the book, this audiobook is a value-added experience. I've done both and noticed that the book has grammatical problems and inconsistencies. Those minor issues go unnoticed in the audiobook since the narrator plows right on through with seat-gripping drama instead of letting your brain get all hung up on the sentence structure by re-reading passages.
