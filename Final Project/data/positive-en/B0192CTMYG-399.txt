The only thing this book was lacking is the fresh book smell. As it is a first year copy, I feel that's not an unreasonable shortcoming. The binding is clean, the pages crisp, and the paper dust sleeve looks to have very minimal wear. Overall I am impressed with this book, now over a decade old.<br /><br />I would like to say thanks. You made my Harry Potter fan girl-friend very happy.
