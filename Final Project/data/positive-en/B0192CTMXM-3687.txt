As soon as I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down.  The action was gripping, the characters were charming, and I was anxious to see how it all ended.  When I got there, I wasn't disappointed!!  I think the way Rowling chose to end her monumental series was just right.  If you're a Harry Potter fan, you HAVE to read this book. No ifs ands or buts...
