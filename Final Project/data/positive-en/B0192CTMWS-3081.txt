What makes Harry Potter just so good is a combination of good writing, fun themes, a fully realized alternate world, and (everyone pay attention) the author's efforts to pre-think out how the series would end so that everything built up to it.<br /><br />Epic stories where the writer doesn't know how it's going to end (The Gunslinger, Lost season 2, Smallville, every thing written by Roger Zelazany) just can't compete with a focused storyline like Harry Potter. I'm not trying to knock them, they are entertaining in their own right. But everything just "feels wrong" when you get to the end finally because the destination never mattered, only the journey.<br /><br />With Harry Potter the destination is as good as the journey, and the world just "feels right" for it.
