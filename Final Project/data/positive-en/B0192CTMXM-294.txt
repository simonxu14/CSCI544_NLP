This one is fun.  Harry is being stalked by Sirius Black, his father's former best friend, who became notorious as the one who sold out the Potters to Voldemort when he blew up his other friend Peter Pettigrew, leaving behind nothing but his little finger.  Sirius has been in Azkaban, the wizard's prison, for several years.  Azkaban is not a nice place.  It is guarded by shades that feed on a person's happiness and can suck out their very soul.  Sirius has escaped, and sources say he will try to kill Harry Potter.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Azkaban guards have been stationed at Hogwarts in an attempt to apprehend Sirius if he should attempt to enter the grounds.  There's a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who is helping Harry learn to defend himself against the Azkaban guards, who seem particularly drawn to him.  And Hagrid is teaching Care of Magical Creatures this year in addition to his gamekeeper's duties.  Draco is attacked by one of Hagrid's animals during a class demonstration, and this not only destroy's Hagrid's confidence in himself but also causes the animal to be scheduled for execution after Draco's father complains to the Ministry of Magic.<br /><br />There's a lot going on at once in this book.  But in the end all of the little events come together and you'll see that everything really is connected.  And Harry will discover some family that he never knew he had.
