I actually really enjoyed this book. It's my favorite movie out of all of them and the book seems to flow just as well as the movie. And like most books it gave those extra details I never knew about that a movie normally doesn't. As I'm going through the books this one does feel more like adult/teen reason material than the other books do. If I changed anything it would probably be how long the chapters are. Makes it hard to get to a stopping point sometimes.
