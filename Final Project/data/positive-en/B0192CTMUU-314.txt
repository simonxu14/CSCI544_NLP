This may be the best of the four Harry Potter books. It's long, but my children (8 through 11) finished it in a few days. Because it is scarier than the earlier books, you should read the book first if your child tends  to get frightened. Also, even though this book stands well on its own, it's  a lot more enjoyable if you have read the earlier books.
