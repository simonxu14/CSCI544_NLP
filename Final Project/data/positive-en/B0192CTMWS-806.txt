Imagine the power of the person who can have millions reading the same book, the same day, all over the world - fortunately, JK Rowling seems a benign sort. This book is loaded with grounds for discussion, for thoughtful comparative analysis of real-life events going on in the world today - attempts at suppression of dissent, stifling of thought, mediocrity in education, bullying, the list goes on and over it all, a rip-roaring good story of the unending battle of good versus evil - but who is evil?  Harry is angry and discovering that being closer to adulthood is not all its cracked up to be. You recall all over again the thrill and misery of being 15 and by the time you put the book down hours and hours after you began and your eyes are burning, you are amazed at just how good Ms. Rowling has gotten at this. Book one now seems simple by comparison.  Such a pity you can't put book five down until you finish it, since you now begin the long wait for book six.......
