I purchased one book, planning to give it my kids for Christmas. When the book arrived and I got a chance to look through it I immediately went online and ordered more so my kids could each have their own copy. My kids are young adults and teens. This is the book that they will keep hold of and read outloud to their kids. The artwork is marvelous. It absolutely captures the scenes and emotions of<br />Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I hope and pray they produce the same quality book for every book in the series.
