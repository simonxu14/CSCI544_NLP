If you haven't been reading the series, I strongly suggest that you start with book 1 and work your way up to this one.  Go do that now, before you read any spoilers.<br /><br />This isn't my favorite book in the series but it really moves the story along pretty effectively.  There is an auror at Hogwarts, teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts.  There is an international wizard competition taking place at the school, too.  Wizards from two respectable schools have come to Hogwarts to challenge the Hogwarts champion in the Triwizard Tournament.  The winner gets fame, fortune, and everything that goes with it.  The losers get to go home... alive and intact if they are very lucky.  There is an age limit set, no student under 17 can enter.  The cup chooses one champion from each school.  But the enchanted cup chooses Harry as an unprecedented (and underage) second champion for Hogwarts, along with Cedric Diggory.  Well, rules are rules and these rules are magical so Harry must compete despite many complaints and his own insistence that he wants nothing to do with the tournament.  Harry has to train for the tournament, then complete a series of very difficult tasks, if he wants to win... but I won't spoil the fun for you.  Let's just say that the villains finally get on the scoreboard before this book is over, and there is a moment here that really defines Harry's life from here on, in more ways than one.
