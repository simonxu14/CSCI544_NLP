You're mistaken when you state there are no black characters in Harry Potter:  Three that we know of in Gryffindor house alone are Dean Thomas, Angelina Johnson and Lee Jordan.  Did you read the book?<br />It is very dark, a bit depressing, but there are some revelations which make situations encountered in the earlier books make sense -- Such as why Snape hates Harry and hated his father so much.  Not a laugh riot, though there are some funny bits, but well worth reading, and probably pivotal to the plots of books 6 & 7.
