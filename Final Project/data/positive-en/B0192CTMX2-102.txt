The book was better than the movie because it linked both films. I also got a good clue that Hermione was going to marry Ron in Book 6 rather than this tome. The book also explored how Snape got to know James and Lily Potter, but was really shocking was his deep affection for Lily. This is the same guy who can't stand her kid!
