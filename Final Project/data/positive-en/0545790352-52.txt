This book is big and heavy and gorgeous... the perfect introduction of the world of Harry Potter to my kids! There is beauty and interest on each page, visually - even on pages with no illustrations, the words are typeset beautifully and there are ink splatters and subtle background texture. A great book to read to kids, but would also be a great way for adults who struggle to read page after page of text in a traditional novel to maybe be able to still get into this amazing story via the more-engaging/less-traditional format. And the attached red ribbon for marking your spot....  perfection.<br /><br />Nutshell: Beautiful book, and worth the price for the combination of writing and illustrating talent.
