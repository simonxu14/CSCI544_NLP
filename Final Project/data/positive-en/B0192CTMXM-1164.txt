My husband and I buy the audio version of the Potter series to listen to on our frequent long drives visiting relatives. We love them because a) the stories are so rich you really can listen to them over and over b) Jim Dale delivers a spot on performance that captures the characters and mood every time.  Even if you've read the printed version (I read it cover-to-cover the first weekend) you'll love the audio book.
