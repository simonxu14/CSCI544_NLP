While I have seen a number of reviews of this HP book, I hadn't seen reviews that referenced the audio version in particular. Jim Dale has been the narrator for all of the unabridged versions of the Harry Potter series. These are word for word readings of the entire book.<br /><br />I have the entire Harry Potter series in both hardback and CD formats. I have read each book cover to cover before listening to the CDs. Both experiences of the books are wonderful. To have the books brought to life with each character uniquely voiced enriched the experience of reading the books.<br /><br />Jim Dale's voice talents make these CDs an amazing adventure. Although book 5 is about 17 CDs, it is an unbelievable journey. There are more characters in book 5 than in any of the previous books, and each of them has a voice of their own. Jim Dale's work adds depth to the characters. His characterization is probably one of the reasons most of the movies haven't lived up to my expectations - how can they compare to the unabridged version I have heard on the CDs.<br /><br />The Harry Potter books are a wonderful chance to share a reading experience with your family. Parents can read to children and children can read to their parents. With the CDs, parents and children can sit together and 'read-along' with Jim Dale and all the characters of the novels.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the novels - give Jim Dale a chance to increase your pleasure in the books with his fabulous and imaginative readings.
