This was one of my favorite HP books and I remember reading it when it was just published. I was originally late to the Potter Party but made up for lost time and started enjoying the books as they came out with this one.<br /><br />The story is one of my faves because of the World Quidditch Cup in the beginning (doesn't Rowling do a great job describing an imaginary sport?) And then the Tri-Wizards Cup. A new concept, new schools and of course, there is something dark behind the challenges and a mystery. The idea of a Yule Ball and dress robes (poor impecunious Ron and his shabby robes) was just great. And Hermione getting dressed up and having attention from the celebrity Krum was a nice touch.<br /><br />Great book. I've re-read it dozens of times and I think it's still one of my favorites of the series.
