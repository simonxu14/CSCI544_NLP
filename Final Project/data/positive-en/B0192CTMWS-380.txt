I listen to lots of books on tape, and Jim Dale's readings of the four Harry Potter books are the best I've ever heard. A lot of people, including me, are very fond of Rob Inglis's readings of the Lord of the Ring books, but these are even better.  Jim Dale does a slew of wonderful voices, and I think his Hagrid and Professor McGonagall in particular are even better than in the movie. Although audio CD's certainly aren't cheap, I think you will find that these can be listened to over and over again with great enjoyment.
