I know these were supposed to be childrens books, but what can I say?  This book reminded me a bit of &quot;The Chronicals of Narnia&quot; in that they begin in a Dreary grey repressive British household and then gradually move into an enchanting world full of excitement, fun and even danger!  Poor Harry Potter, trapped with his relatives, the Durdsleys who make him sleep under the stiars while their own son has two bedrooms.  Then one day he starts receiving letters which they do not allow him to read.  However everytime they throw them out the next day more an more keep appearing, under the door, down the chimmney, through the window.  Harry finally discovers that he has been admitted to the Hogwarts school of Wizardry, where his long dead parents first met.  All this is unknown to him and begins one of the most fun stories of the year!
