Harry's expression reminds us that this was his refuge and home.<br /><br />Hagrid has kind eyes but a fierce presence and the way the motor cycle handlebars look like pencils in his massive grip made me laugh.<br /><br />Jim Kay clearly adores these characters and his illustrations are a love poem to JK Rowling that we get to share.<br /><br />You need this book in your library.
