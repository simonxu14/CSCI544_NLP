I'll keep this short since if you're here you are probably familiar with the set and setting of this modern epic...<br />BRIEFLY [just in case]; this is the fifth of seven promised novels which deal with the coming of age of a certain gifted [and perhaps star-crossed] young wizard named Harry.  A tragic predicate to the first novel places young Master Potter in the care of his distinctly NON-magical relatives on Privett Drive until the first of many changes in his being commences with the arrival of an airborne [and feathery] invitation to HogWartz school.  Not an ordinary [English] boarding school BY ANY MEANS and run by and extra extra ordinary HeadMaster with no small interest in Harry's well being, his journey to become who he really is takes place in this beautiful [although not entirely safe] and fanciful enviroment housed in a quirky building.<br />This series is NOT really appropriate to dive into at the point this book commences... i TRULY needed to re-read the fourth book, but this one arrived and i was DRAWN IN AGAIN, curse you Rowling  ;]~<br />If you liked the Artimus Fowl series or would like to see if Rowling's style and these character driven stories [Mr. Potter is SURROUNDED by a colorful and wise group of amazing mentors, helpers, [boi]friends, enemyies, fellow magic folk, etc.], proceed to pick up the first volume [a VERY VERY much more brief reading adventure] and give my boy Harry a spin.  You won't be dissapointed.<br />Cheers to the first Billion $, Lady J.K. - - - glad it was you that made the mark and not some hack like Steele, Clancy, Grisham, et al...<br />Peaxe,<br />M3!
