I pre-ordered this book not knowing what I was getting however when I received my book yesterday I was floored at the detail and the size of the book, its 8x10 maybe a little larger and it has the whole amazing story with pictures!!!! This book is great for a Harry porter fan or a gift to a child who has never read the story, I plan on ordering more as Christmas gifts.  Lastly I was reading on line that they plan to release a new illustrated book annualyso keep a look out for the next book in 2016.... THIS IS A MUST BUY.
