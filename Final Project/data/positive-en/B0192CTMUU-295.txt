This book was the best book i have read in all of my 25 years.  I started buying them for my children but I enjoy them far more.  The author is unbeleivable.  She brings all the different plot twists together without  getting them jumbled or confused. Definitley buy this book and the other  three.  I have read the others twice and wil start reading this one again  as soon as i get it back from all my relative.  Well done J.K Rowlings.
