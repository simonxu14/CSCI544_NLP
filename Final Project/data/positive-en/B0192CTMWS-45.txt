Harry meets Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs some of my favorite characters which I'm sure you'll love just as much.  Harry discovers and meets people from his parents past who were involved in their death.  Werewolves and magical maps are just some of the things that will captivate you.  My only question remains (same with every other wizard loving muggle) how did George and Fred never notice nor mention Wormtail?
