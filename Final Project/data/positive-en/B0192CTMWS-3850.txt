I was terrified of opening book 7 and reading it. I had avoided spoilers and reviews like crazy but had feared the worst for Harry. I won't say how it ended, I won't spoil it for those readers who haven't finished it but lets just say true fans will agree that its the perfect ending. Yes its tragic, yes its realistic, no its not too far fetched (within the series constraints)...JK did it again, its the perfect ending. But does anyone else who's finished the book feel a little lost now? For years we've all been reading, theorizing, reading again and now...well its truly over. I feel somewhat lost...like a piece of my childhood is finally over with (and I haven't been a child for years now). Goodbye Harry, you were and will always be a wonderful and treasured piece of all of our lives.
