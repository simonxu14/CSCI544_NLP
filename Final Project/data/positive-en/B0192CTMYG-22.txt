This is the second time I've read this book, and knowing the end to the series, I was amazed at all the seeds J.K. Rowling wisely planted. I know the series starts out mainly as YA, but the themes of abuse and hope can be deeply appreciated at an adult level. While Rowling takes your hand and begins to introduce you to the Magical World, it can feel a bit slow, but maybe that's because I'm already so familiar with it. I zoomed right through the book, wanting more (and also to watch the movie again).<br /><br />I would say that as a lover of this world and series, this book may seem a bit slow at times, but seeing as it sets the ground work for the series, it's just right.
