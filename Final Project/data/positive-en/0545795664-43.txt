This is a GREAT book for any level of Pokemon fandom!  My kids made fun of me for trying to understand the latest Pokemon Go craze, now they ask me about them!!  I love that this book has helped me reconnect on a &#34;kids&#34; level with my adult and teen children.  We have developed a friendly rivalry!
