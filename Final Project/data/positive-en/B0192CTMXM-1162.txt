All the ends have been nicely tied, the relationships have been settled in the manner fans would have expected but I felt strangely let down. Perhaps it is the realisation that Harry and his friends will not have a new adventure next year. This of course is as it should be, Harry after all is the ultimate teenager so he wouldn't do to be hanging around in his 30's, 40's or heaven forebid his 60's. Farewell Harry et al.
