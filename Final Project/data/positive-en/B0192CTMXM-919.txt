I think JK Rowling outdid herself on this one. Much more comes into play--background info, character development, and so on. Yes, a main character dies; it is supremely well done and really adds to the characterization of Harry, Sirius, Snape, Lupin, Dumbledore, and others.<br />Harry is such a jerk in this book; but hey, he's a teenager who needs to grow up quickly lest others die due to his immaturity. We learn so much more about Lupin, Sirius, and Snape, especially! I love complex characters, and JK gave me plenty in this book. She also significantly broadened our understanding of the wizarding world.<br />In addition, the editing was well done, unlike Book 4, so that the reader could really enjoy the story. Order of the Phoenix pushed Book 3 into second place.
