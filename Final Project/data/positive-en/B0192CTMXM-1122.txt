I thought it was perfect. Everything that happened had such a purpose and such meaning. I spent a very long time on the last fifty pages being wowed at what was happening and becoming saddened at the fact that it was all coming to an end. I loved the ending. The last sentence in the epilogue was perfect. Without the epilogue there would be so many question marks. It definitely was amazing.<br /><br />Thank you for your time<br />and feel free to comment<br />this review,<br />Loran
