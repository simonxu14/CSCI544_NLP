I'm late to the Harry Potter party, but I guess it's better late than never. I bought a used copy to read to my kids at bedtime, and we all loved it. The writing is sharp and funny, and had us laughing out loud. Harry Potter's wizard world was so beautifully described, it seemed more real than our own lives, at times. I can see why this was such a big deal when it came out almost 20 years ago -- it's a great book, especially for the middle grade set. Glad we finally got on board the Hogwarts Express!
