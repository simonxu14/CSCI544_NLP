Well, congratulations to Ms.Rowling, she really did an excellent job, not only on this book, but in captivating millions of people all around the world, with her incredible wit, heart, and imagination.<br />That said, this book is excellent, the only reason why I left off (1) star is because it's not complete (she said we'd know EVERYTHING, no you won't), and the last chapter seemed to be tacked on to a already "finished" book.<br /><br />To describe the book without giving it away, it's dark, much darker than any of the other Potter books, if you can imagine. It's the journey, not the destination that is the darkest, you learn more about Albus, Severus, Lupin, the mind of "He Who Must Not be Named", Ron, and countless others.<br />Some parts definitely made me cry, and others made me scream with joy, and others made me mad @ the author, but even then, I understood her point.<br />*Semi-Spoiler warning*<br />"He who craps on you may not be your enemy, and he who wipes it away may not be your friend."<br />Pardon my language, but you'll get it when you read the book.
