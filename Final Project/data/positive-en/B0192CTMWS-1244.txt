The 7th and final installment of the Harry Potter series lives up to what I've come to expect from Rowling.  It is exciting, touching, and filled with suspense until the very end.  As with most Potter fans, I am sad at the close of this phenomenal series, but I have not been disappointed.  I look forward with anticipation to Rowling's next literary venture.
