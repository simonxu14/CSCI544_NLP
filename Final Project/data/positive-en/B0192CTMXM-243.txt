Wow!!!  I originally bought the first book for my dyslexic neice. I fell for this series too.  This ending is powerful.  It is the classic coming of age.  The quintensial good vs. evil.  It marveously paced.  The book pulls together so many questions and ends perfectly.  I started reading and couldn't stop until I read the lst sentence.  If you love this magical world, you won't be disapointed.<br /><br />Lisa
