The long-awaited 5th installment of the Harry Potter series came to my doorstep on June 21, just as Amazon promised.  I read as much as I could that weekend and was able to finish up last night.  While it took me longer to get into this book than the others, I was thoroughly satisfied.  It follows the typical format, starting out at the Dursley's home, a year at Hogwarts and then ending in a battle, with Dumbledore explaining everything unknown to Harry, though I felt this book reads differently than the previous ones.  It is much darker, the characters are angrier and experiencing emotion much more than before.  The danger and confusion, especially for Harry, is heightened, and it makes for an interesting read.  Longtime fans, especially the younger ones, may be put off by this, but those that are will most likely come to appreciate it.  I think Rowling, in order to make a believable adolescent protagonist, HAD to write the story this way.  Harry and the other 5th years have all matured a great deal since the first book and I was pleased to see the Rowling is letting them grow up.  A very long book, but worth every page.
