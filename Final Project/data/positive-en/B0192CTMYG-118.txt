This series is awesome! Harry Potter is so fun to read. If you're interested, get it if you can! You will be truly amazed by what J.K. Rowling has written. She is an amazing writer. My family has read this over the summer of 2016. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are great friends and find out secrets about what is not known to other students in Hogwarts. GREATEST BOOK SERIES EVER. READ IF YOU LOVE MYTHICAL, MAGIC LIKE THINGS. Thankyou. =D
