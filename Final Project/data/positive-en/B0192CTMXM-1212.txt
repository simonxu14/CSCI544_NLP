I liked Phoenix much better than Goblet of Fire. It's very rich, with excitement and unexpected developments coming almost non-stop. One intriguing aspect is that a lot of the pending questions from past books are answered here, so it could be a challenge for J.K. Rowling to keep the same level of suspense in book #6. But who cares, book 5 is here now and is big fun to read.
