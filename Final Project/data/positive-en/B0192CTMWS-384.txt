As much as I love Harry Potter books, it was a tad bit of a disappointment.  There were parts of the book that I almost snoozed, others where I couldn't care if Harry dies or not because he was making me mad.  Well, I guess that was the point of it? He's human? He's still a kid? OK, I'm a parent...<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it's still a fun read and yes, you will want to know what happens to Harry and friends! I don't want to give up any spoilers for those who still want to read it and don't know the ending.
