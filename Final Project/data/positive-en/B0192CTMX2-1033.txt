Harry Potter 7 is a fabulous read. It is gripping and engaging. A whole lot better than the movie, as it usually is with movies remakes in general. JK Rowling does an amazing job of bringing together all the looseends and from the previous books which makes for a coherent reading.<br /><br />For an avid Harry Potter fan this is amust read and it is like the icing on cake. The climax is on the lines you expected but there definite twists and turns in the plot. If towards the middle the book get a little too detailed my earnest suggestion there is to continue reading.
