SPECIAL NOTE: For U.S. customers purchasing the illustrated edition of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, you will notice the text has NOT been converted to the &#34;Americanized&#34; version of the original U.S. releases (with the exception of changing all &#34;Philosopher's Stone&#34; mentions to &#34;Sorcerer's Stone&#34;).  So far, I have noticed the following: (EU/US) dialling / dialing; Shan't! / Won't!; sherbet lemon / lemon drop; motorbike / motorcycle; and dustbin / trashcan.  For many purists of the series who never liked the idea of modifying the original text for an American audience, this is a good thing.  Good or bad is naturally for each reader to decide--just know, if you plan to read the books while listening to Jim Dale's audiobooks, you'll notice a few superficial differences.<br /><br />The quality of this new illustrated edition is phenomenal.  I've been excited about the release of this book since it was announced, but I never expected the book as a whole to be so well crafted.<br /><br />A couple of things to note:<br />1. Underneath the book jacket, the novel is bound in a sturdy red hardback with gold lettering on the spine.<br />2. The paper is thick with an eggshell glossy finish.<br />3. All chapter intros are illustrated.<br />4. Some images take up full pages or multiple pages.  Most illustrations share the page with text.<br />5. Every inch of the book is illustrated or decorated in some fashion.  There are NO white pages in the book.  Even the pages without large illustrations have the paper printed and marked with ink blots or paper &#34;stains&#34;.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this for anyone looking to read the series (again, or for the first time), especially if you plan to read this with someone younger.  If this book is a demonstration of what is to come with the illustrated editions for the rest of the series, we're all in for six more impeccable treats.
