I had just finished reading it and it set up some very good story-lines such as the relationships between Harry and his friends as well as the origins of Voldemort. But what got me the most is the end of the story where Harry and Hermione become apart of the Weasley family in the end. The story was sad, but it brought together Harry and his friends together forever. I'm going to miss any follow up stories, but this one ended the series with a bang. Trust me , check this one out, you won't be disappointed.
