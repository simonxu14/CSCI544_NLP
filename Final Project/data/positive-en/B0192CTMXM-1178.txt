No spoilers in this review. I just want to say that the Harry Potter series keeps getting better and better. Jim Dale's voice characterizations are so good and so distinct, that the audio book seems more like a radio play rather than a straight book reading.  I recommend the entire series and you can listen to them again and again.  Oh and the story is fantastic, too bad there's only two more books left.
