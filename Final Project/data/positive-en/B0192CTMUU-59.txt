Like the other books in the series one gets caught up in the magical world until it seems as though Harry's world IS the normal world! By the fourth  book (read the first three first) we are familiar with the terms and know  the characters, so Rowlling is free to add all sorts of new information and  plot twists. It's also a more serious book that does not shy away from  pain, loneliness and as everyone knows - death. The appeal for adults is in  the clever use of common terms and knowledge, to create a new and fresh  outlook on what just might be! BTW the illustrations by Grandpre in the US  Scholastic edition (cover and inside)  are by far better than the UK  Bloomsbury one.
