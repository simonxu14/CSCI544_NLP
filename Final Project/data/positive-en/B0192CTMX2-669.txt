This book was purchased to be a second copy to have around to read without concern over being damaged by the cat knocking it off of the table or similar accidents.  I considered the book as being in &#34;very good condition&#34;  including the jacket, as described by the seller, thus the 5 star rating.<br />The book was shipped promptly.
