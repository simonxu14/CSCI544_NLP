I'm a big J.K. Rowling fan and therefore a Harry Potter enthusiast. Excellently written. If you love the rest of the series you will love this one even more. Not for young children (under 8-10). This one gets even darker than the others. Spoiler Alert!!!  There is a lot of characters that die in this one.
