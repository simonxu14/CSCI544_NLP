I waited for this book to arrive with excitement and with dread because I knew it was the end.  Even after it arrived, I put off reading it for almost a day because I knew after I started it I would spend every waking moment reading it and then it would be over.<br /><br />Rowling did not disappoint me.  So many questions from earlier books were answered and loose ends tied together.  I do wish I had reread the whole series before DH arrived.  I had a little trouble remembering things that were referred to from earlier books.  The last few chapters left me in tears.  I don't think I've ever cried over a book before.  It was that powerful emotionally to me.<br /><br />I would love to see JKR come up with another series but the sheer genius and magic of Harry Potter will probably never be equaled.  Thank you, JKR, for taking us with you on the journey of Harry Potter.  I'm looking forward to starting the series in a few years with my son.  He's just turned six and ought to be ready for the first book in a year or two.<br /><br />In case you couldn't tell, I highly recommend this book!
