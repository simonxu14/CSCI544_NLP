This is an amazing new edition and a must for any Harry Potter fan's collection. I already own the complete series in hardback, but I will definitely be buying each of these new illustrated editions as they come out. The incorporation of the illustrations with the text is wonderfully well done. Some illustrations take up a full page on their own, but the majority are incorporated into layouts with the text. And even on pages that don't contain illustrations, there are &#34;ink marks&#34; and &#34;water spots&#34; that make it so no page is completely white. The text is displayed in 2 columns per page, and is nice point size for reading at. The book is a bit larger than normal, making it a perfect coffee table or display book. Although it has more pages than the hardback edition of Sorcerer's Stone, it is not too much thicker. I'm interested to see how large the later books end up being! I have not yet sat down to re-read the story with the illustrations, but have greatly enjoyed just leafing through the book and discovering all the new illustrations. Jim Kay has done a wonderful job with these and they truly help bring the story of the boy wizard to life in a new way. I love that he was able to get away from how the movies depicted things to be and come up with his own version. I especially love his depiction of Hogwarts, I wish I could have it as a print to hang on my wall! I can't wait for the next Illustrated Edition to come out next fall so I can add that to my collection as well.
