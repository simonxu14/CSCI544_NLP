I really enjoyed the order of the Phoenix. I listened to the audio version, (17 tapes in all), and was mesmerized by the narrator's spectacular voice and he quirky and enduring creatures of Harry's world. In particular, I loved seeing Snape as a teenager, and Luna Lovegood was an excellent secondary character.<br />I disagree with others who mention the book is too long... I prefer my books longer! They are longer to finish! LOL. I was pleasantly surprised to see Ron come into his own in this installment, I can't wait for Harry's next book, with hopefully more revelations about Snape!
