Winding up the series, JK Rowling has tied together all the threads of her previous books. On the run, Harry, Ron and Hermione strive to find the secret of Harry's past, how the prophecy would be fulfilled, and the final battle. The final battle being fought, Harry discovers the full extent of the bond between him and Voldemort. With the deaths of many characters we've grown to know and love, the big surprise comes that Harry does not destroy Voldemort. That is not a spoiler, but rather a teaser. I'll say no more on that if you have not read the book.<br /><br />I only wish there were more authors like Rowling that don't dumb down their books.
