Fed Ex delivered at 1:30 p.m. and I read straight through (with a short break for dinner) to finish this book in one day! This book kept me hovering on the edge the whole time. I liked it because I could relate to  some of the things that happened to Harry. (You'll have to read it  yourself!)  &quot;Shiva's Fire&quot; was equal with this book.  This book  is just as interesting as the other  Harry Potter books, but I don't  reccomend it for kids under the age of 4/5 because there are a lot of  fights and deaths. (I am 13.)
