I grew up with Harry Potter, it was very important for me to have this book to read to my kids.<br /><br />I didn't do much research on the illustrated version, but I wasn't expecting what arrived. I honestly expected it to be a graphic novel (Like how &#34;The Last Unicorn&#34; and &#34;Twilight&#34; were converted into, a sort of comic-book version) - Instead I received a book with pictures and text.<br /><br />I am not upset with this at all, just surprised, and honestly if I would have known prior, I still would have purchased it, the illustrations are enough to help my 5 year old keep up, although I suspect I will re-read this book many times before she truly understands.<br /><br />The illustrations are beautiful, it is wonderful to reread this book and MYSELF re-discover many things I had forgotten over the years. (Or just have a greater understanding of)<br /><br />My daughter is loving snuggling on the couch before bed, with hot chocolate, blankets and a chapter of Harry Potter, sure it wasn't what I expected, but it's still wonderfully perfect
