At about page 384, I realized that what I thought was a dark beginning to the fifth book of the Harry Potter series, was going to continue on in an unexpected veil of foreboding and serious (Sirius?) quandries for the once innocent Harry Potter. After the dire events of book four, there is no way that our favorite young wizard could remain the understanding, most-always-level-headed young boy we readers have grown to love. This go round delves especially deep into the mind of Harry. He's at a delicate age, but his experiences over the past 4 1/2 year have left little else that could be described as such. Rowling pulls no punches and while I found it a bit unnerving to see the dark moods and dark thoughts of Harry, it made him all the more real for me and all the more anxious to see how he would handle the next "big challenge" facing him.<br />I was also excited to learn more about my other favorites...Sirius, the Weasleys, Hermione...even the Dursleys (some surprises there for sure!)<br />I know the phrase "this is a darker book" has been used for every book since The Sorcerer's Stone, but it is truly a phrase MOST applicable to this book. There are disturbing moments on many different levels. But it only serves to make the characters more endearing and we as readers ever so anxious to see...what happens....NEXT.<br />A great read of 730+ pages that went by all too fast!
