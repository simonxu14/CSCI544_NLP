I got this as a language learning tool, to work on my Chinese vocabulary and grammar over the summer (during a break in my Chinese classes). I was given the idea from a language-learning fanatic, who said that reading a foreign version of a favorite book can do a lot to enhance your study, especially if traditional language-learning methods bore or fail you. I was going to buy the first book in the Harry Potter series, but this one was a little less expensive, and I enjoy it even more than Sorcerer's Stone anyway. It's been a great tool so far, especially comparing Chinese grammar alongside the English copy.
