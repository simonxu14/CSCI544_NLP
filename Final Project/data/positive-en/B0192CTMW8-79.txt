Harry Potter is now our favorite bedtime reading.  We love the characters, and Ms. Rowling does a great job of developing a sense of place.  Incidentally, &quot;we&quot; are two kids in our late thirties.  Friendship, loyalty, and bravery are appealing at any age.  We bought the hardcovers - I plan to re-read these a few times while I wait impatiently for the next 3 books.
