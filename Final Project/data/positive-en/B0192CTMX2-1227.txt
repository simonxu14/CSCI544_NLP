Everything  I've ordered through Amazon has had superb service and value.  Was able to find the complete Set of Harry Potter books on tape and have given to my daaughter as an early Christmas gift.  So far, she is only on the Second book, but loves it.  She has all of the printed books, but find the naration so great.  Thanks for the great condition of the merchandise.
