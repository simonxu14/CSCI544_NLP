Another great installment in the Harry Potter series. This book tells the tale of Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts with the same engrossing language and charm of the previous three. I would highly recommend this book to all lover's of the Harry Potter series. While it is a lengthy 700+ pages it is  a very enjoyable read.
