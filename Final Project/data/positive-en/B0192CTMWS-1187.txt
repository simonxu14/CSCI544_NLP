J.K. Rowling gave us a great last book. I didn't think she would be able to sum everything up in a way that would please the audience. She proved me wrong. I won't go into any specifics of the book. I will say if you are not a Harry Potter fan I suggest you become one. This is one of those legendary tales people will be talking about for years to come and you will want to have been on the journey.
