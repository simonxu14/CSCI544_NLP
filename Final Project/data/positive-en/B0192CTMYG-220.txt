I am a 57 year old software professional I bought the unabridged book on tape read by Jim Dale to entertain me during my long commute to and from  work. I quickly became charmed, amused, and totally involved in this  delightful story and found myself sitting in the garage not wanting to go  in the house until the chapter was finished. You will laugh out loud at  some of the droll throw away comments by characters in this book.
