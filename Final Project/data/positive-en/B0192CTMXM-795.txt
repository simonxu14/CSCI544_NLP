If you are a fan of Harry Potter, you won't want to miss the audio CD version read by Jim Dale. As he has done with the previous six stories, Jim brings vibrant character voices and great sense of style to his reading of the seventh story of the famous boy wizard, Harry Potter. Dale's consistent performance makes it easy to know which character is speaking, and his performance is top-notch.<br /><br />The Harry Potter books are my favorite audio CD's, and that is because of Dale's talent and performance abilities.<br /><br />The Audio CD is perfect for listening to in the car or on your MP3 player (ripping to MP3 format is required, but can easily be done with iTunes or other software). This is not an iPod audiobook, and it won't show up on your iPod as an audiobook unless you take several conversion steps that you can find on other websites.<br /><br />Both adults and children will love listening to Dale's fantastic reading of J.K. Rowling's fantastic tale in this, the concluding installment, of the Harry Potter series.
