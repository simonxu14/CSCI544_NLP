I have been a HP fan for a long time. To be able to share them with my young daughter in this format has been amazing. I love that for her, she will grow up reading this illustrated series. I was afraid it was just going to be Sorcerer's Stone as some special release and was ecstatic to see that they are releasing Chamber of Secrets as well!!!
