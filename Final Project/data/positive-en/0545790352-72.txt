The artwork is beautiful. This book is a dream come true and a must-have for any Harry Potter fan. I am able to share one of my favorite stories and memories of childhood with my own children now, and they are fascinated by the story's words and illustrations.<br /><br />I pre-ordered this book on Amazon for Christmas 2015 and will continue to do so until every book is in our collection.
