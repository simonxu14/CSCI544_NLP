Remember when somebody first recommended this series and tried explaining that it was about a boy wizard and his adventures at school.  You gave them a strange look, didn't you? Think about that cliched plot idea and then look back at what JK Rowling has accomplished with this brilliant series.<br /><br />The only bad thing about this book is that it had to end.  JK Rowling has said that this is her last book about Harry but her inherent talent is obvious and I would eagerly read anything else that she writes (no matter how bizarre it might sound at first).  It would have been easy for her to give us cliched tie-ups to the different plot lines but she doesn't.  Remarkably, she weaves a compelling story that draws the reader even further into the emotions of the characters than we ever thought possible and answers every question with surprising and very entertaining answers.<br /><br />Even if JK Rowling thinks she can't match the Harry Potter success, who cares.  She is a brilliant writer and has an incredible talent - I hope she continues writing...anything.
