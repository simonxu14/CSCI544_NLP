The first of the Harry Potter books takes us on a journey of adventure, mystery, fantasy and magic. It gets the reader hooked from the very beginning and keeps us turning the pages as fast as we can. This is a book not only for young adults but for us oldsters too. This is a story of a young boy being raised by hateful relatives, who's very life is about to change in ways he never imagined. We meet an array of characters from his aunt and uncle who are Muggles, to Hagrid, to Professor Dumbledore, to.... well, most people already know the story. BUT if you don't then pick up the first book and get reading. You're in for the treat of your life.
