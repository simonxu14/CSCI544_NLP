Bigger, yes, but better?  Madame Rowling has told another riveting installment of the young wizard's tale in a whopping 734 pages which all the diehards will buy.  My 13-year-old son and I had a ritual whereby as the books came out I read them aloud to him over the space of a few days,  but this time I ended up synopsising the book and only reading the last  four chapters aloud.  His assessment was &quot;Wow, Mom, the little kids  are going to have nightmares,&quot; with which I agree. I understand that  Ms. Rowling is upping the ante as her perceived audience grows up along  with Harry; Little Orphan Annie this is not.  But she continues to gather 7  and 8-year-old fans as well.  Perhaps a warning on the book: &quot;Caution;  content not necessarily suitable for young children&quot;?  Don't get me  wrong; it's a great book, and the teen market is an abyss except for this  series.  As a mother of two teens who adore Harry, I'm grateful for this  fourth book, and we're all on line for the next one!
