I LOVE this book! I love everything Harry Potter and so when I saw this was coming out and seeing sneak peeks of the illustrations I HAD to per-order it, I knew it would sell out in a heartbeat, and I don't regret it a bit! I busied myself outside just waiting for it to arrive! I HIGHLY recommend this book wether you're a hardcore Harry Potter fan like me, someone just getting into the series and want to see amazing artwork to go with the story, or just a collector of fantastic books, get this book, you will not regret it!
