I just re-read the series for the umpteenth time - even though I'm over 50.  I always enjoy the seventh book the most but they are all fun to read.  They fit so well together with minor events in the earlier books having a large impact on the future books - like the Vanishing Cabinet when it's thrown by Nick to get Harry out of trouble.  Who could predict the importance of that books later.<br /><br />I wish JK Rowling included the following two scenes:<br />1.  The Dursleys disaperating after they leave the house<br />2.  Hermione and the cup<br /><br />Oh well.  My imagination does fairly well.
