Book #66 Read in 2016<br />Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire by J.K. Rowling<br /><br />This was a re-read for me.  This is my favorite book series of all time.  In this book, #4 in the series, Harry is entered into the Tri-Wizard competition which can be very dangerous to its participants.  Who is trying to get him hurt or killed?  This series is full of action, humor and mystery, with wonderfully written characters.
