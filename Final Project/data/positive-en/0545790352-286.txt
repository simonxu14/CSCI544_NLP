My son is now 10 years old, and has been a Harry Potter fan since he was 6.  We have listened to the audiobooks, but he has not read any of the books himself yet.  When I saw this illustrated version come out, I just knew I had to get it for him.  I was thrilled when it arrived just before Christmas.  The cover, binding, size, illustrations, everything, are just perfect.  This is an heirloom quality book, and I look forward to buying the rest of the series in this format.
