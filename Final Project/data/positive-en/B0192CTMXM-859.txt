My sons and are big fans: books, movies, and audio books.  JK Rowling: I am so amazed how on person can have such an imagination and be such an observer of characters as to be able to portray the silly and wise, the loving and hateful, young and old.  Jim Dale (narrator) is so entertaining, offering an endless variety of voice and personality to the characters in the story.<br /><br />Great entertainment!  After a 14 hour round trip in vacation we still hadn't had enough.<br /><br />Harry Potter will have been a great family memory when my kids are grown.  We had spent hours snuggled together reading (it was mandatory to finish the books before movie or audio tapes), shared the anticipation of the new movies and books, and now it is closely related to traveling on family trips.  I am thankful to the author for this common bond we will always share and fond memories we have.
