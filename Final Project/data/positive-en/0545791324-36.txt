This is a fantastic book! I am a big fan of Jim Kay's art and this did not disappoint.  The prints are beautiful, well-thought, and delightful. I loved the first book, and this is just as great! Jim Kay used some incredible techniques to enhance the feeling of magic and whimsy of the wizarding world. The book is a great size, good price, and a lovely addition to any Potterhead's library. I am excited for the rest of the series!
