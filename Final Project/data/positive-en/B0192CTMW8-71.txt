These books first came to my attention when they were reviewed by a national news magazine.I had to read them and see what it was all about and now I am hooked and anxiously awaiting the next book. If you think that  this is just a book for children ,think again it is for all of us who still  have a little of peter pan in  us and do not want to grow up. It is a  wonderful book to read to or with your children or grandchildren but if you  do not have acess to children and seeing it through their eyes-do not let  this deter you buy the books anyway and enjoy!
