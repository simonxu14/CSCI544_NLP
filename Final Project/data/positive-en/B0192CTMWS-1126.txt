I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this book. I read slowly to savor it so I could experience it longer. Of course, by the last several chapters I found I couldn't "savor" it any longer cuz it just got too exciting to put down! The author does a spectacular job of wrapping up the saga. There are no loose ends! I hope she writes another series! I've read many other fantasy books and they just don't have the magical touch of Rowlings! She's a genious!
