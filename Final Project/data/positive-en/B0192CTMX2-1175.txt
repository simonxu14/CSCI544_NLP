This was a good series from the beginning to end. I think J. K. Rowling did an excellent job. I really don't know what author that could ever imagine or produce a story like this kind of story ever again. It will forever be a favorite of mine. God Bless you J. K. Rowling your stories of Harry Potter had many lessons of learining from right to wrong, from meaning of purpose, and above all true friendship :)
