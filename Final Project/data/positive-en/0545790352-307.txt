It's Harry Potter..it can do no wrong. But seriously, this book is amazing! There are so many stunning illustrations throughout the book and I could spent hours just really looking at the pictures. My 8 year old is so excited to read this since it now has pictures. I am so thrilled to add this to my ever growing Harry Potter collection and look forward to the release of the others!
