This is the second Harry Potter book (also heard book 2) read by Jim Dale.  He is simply outstanding.  Even if you've already read the book several times, you'll thoroughly enjoy listening to Jim Dale read it to you again.  The voices he does, the cadence, the enthusiasm, everything about the manner in which he brings Harry and his friends to life is marvelous.  Taking a long trip in your car?  Turn off the radio, and pop this in and enjoy!!
