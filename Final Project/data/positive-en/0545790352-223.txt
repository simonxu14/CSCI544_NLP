For as much as I use Amazon, I've never left a written review before.  However, I felt so strongly about this, I had to give this book it's due, and its absolutely amazing.  The Harry Potter story and books are fantastic and should be read, either with this particular book or another. However, what sets this book apart are the beautifully well-done illustrations that fill its pages (not every page, but a large majority).  The pages are thick and glossy.  I am already anxiously awaiting the next book to be illustrated.  Would recommend without hesitation to any Harry Potter fan or anyone other interested party.
