I had missed getting this book when I bought the rest of them, and could figure out most of the big details, but wanted the &#34;real deal&#34; and was glad to find this book AND with the same cover as the others. I have now read them all at least three times. Great books and wish she would pick up the grown kids and continue the story. By the way, I am a 70 year old great grandma, but I do love these &#34;grabbing&#34; stories.
