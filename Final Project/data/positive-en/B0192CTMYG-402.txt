Finally, a little person's fantasy world publicized.  I read this novel to my 5-year-old daughter and she loves it.  Of course, a small bit of the end will be edited for her ears, but when she gets older, she may read it all  she wants.  I thoroughly enjoyed the entire book.  Humorous, serious, and  thoughtful towards building loyal friendships this book really shines.
