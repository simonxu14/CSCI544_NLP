Massive entry in the Potter lore. The mystery becomes front and center in this one. The revelations are amazing and impossible to see coming. What really makes this book is the incredible finally. While reading it I was transfixed to the page. After it was over I thought about it for days. It just works so well. As always the characters are what ultimately makes this entry so good.
