Book itself is awesome. There's nothing like it. Wonderful colors and illustrations. Perfect binding and paper.<br />My only complain is the packaging. The box was too big for the book, even though the book is big and heavy. And there was barely some wrinkled paper &#34;covering&#34; or &#34;protecting&#34; the book inside. As a result, sadly for me, the cover or jacket of the book was torn almost to the middle of the book. I have to admit that I was pissed off, but after talking to Amazon customer service, we reached a happy ending.<br /><br />The book is like a dream come true for potterheads. If you consider yourself one this item cannot be out of shelf. It is must have.<br />Can't wait to get the others when they come out.
