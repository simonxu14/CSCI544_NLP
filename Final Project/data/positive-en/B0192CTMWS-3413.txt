The seventh and final book in the Harry Potter series fully lives up to all of the hype preceeding its release. It is a fun, easy read, and it answers all of the questions that the followers of the series have had for quite some time.<br /><br />Do not get me wrong, this is not a "bunnies & fluff" book, there are some truly hard moments in it, and the terrible loss of some beloved characters. But the overall tone of the story is adventurous fun! The book is action packed and moves with speed. There are some really great twists and turns in the plot - all of which fit and make perfect sense.<br /><br />This has now become my favorite book of the series; with book #3 in second place.<br /><br />Enjoy!
