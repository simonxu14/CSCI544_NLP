I recieved the book this morning, and just finished it, I think that this book is definatly darker than the last 4, ofcourse the people that read the last books have aged since book 4 came out. Harry is now a full teenager, he isnt a child anymore, you can notice the changes that have overcome him since Voldemort was resurrected in book 4....  This time Harry doesnt have to deal with Voldemort as much as he has to deal with the magic goverment. His new defense against the dark arts teacher is pure evil. I dont want to give much away about the book. It is a very good read, but when you read it you will see Rowling's writing style has become a bit deeper, and changed slightly, it isnt just "games" anymore. This book really brings out the real darkness of the Potter world. Overall I gave this book 5 stars because it really does live up to the Harry Potter series, even though the book is diffrent from the other 4. Its not so easy to explain, but it is a good buy, and now when people say Harry Potter is only for young people, force them to read this book, and that should make them change thier minds, I'm 17, and I do not think that this book falls in an age category younger than mine. Cheers Rowling for another excellent Potter book!
