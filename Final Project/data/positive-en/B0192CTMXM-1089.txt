What can I say?  Rowlings has done it again.  I cannot believe that as an adult I can become so engrossed in a child's book (and I read regularly).  Harry Potter continues to grow up.  He has developed some annoying attitudes but those clear up.  Rowlings continues to taunt us with a little bit more information about Harry's destinty that makes me ready for the next book.  A definite must for Harry Potter fans!  However, if you haven't read the first four, it might be better to start at the beginning.
