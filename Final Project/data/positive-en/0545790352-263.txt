I love Harry Potter and am so excited to have this book! It's a hard cover book, special edition, fully illustrated. It is absolutely beautiful!!! I believe it is the same artist who did the drawings for the original book covers, because it is the same style. It also has a red ribbon attached for a bookmark. I love this book and cannot wait to get the rest!
