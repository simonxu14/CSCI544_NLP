Beautiful, elegant, fully illustrated version of Harry Potter & The Sorcerer's Stone. I bought this book as a keepsake for my preschool aged daughter. We have been slowly reading through the chapters of the book at her bedtime. I hope this will remain a cherished memory for her and that I can pass the book onto her as she gets older. Right now it's a lovely bonding time for the two of us as I pass my love for Harry Potter down to her.
