"To Kill A Mockingbird" until now, was my favorite book of all time. I say that to let you know, I am no "spring chicken". In all fairness, "Deathly Hallows" power lies in the fact that it represents the entire series. Having said that however, that's also what puts so much pressure on it to deliver - and it does. By now, everyone has probably read a synopsis or review so I'll spare you that but will suggest, if you're having withdrawal and looking for reading to help, try Douglas Adams "Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy" Series.<br /><a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Ultimate-Hitchhiker-s-Guide-Five-Complete-Novels-and-One-Story-Deluxe-Edition/dp/0517226952/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide: Five Complete Novels and One Story (Deluxe Edition)</a>
