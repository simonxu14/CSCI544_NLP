My 8 year-old son and I prepared for book IV by re-reading books I-III, which was a great way to remember and discover new details about Harry's world.<br />I have now just finished reading Book IV on my own. Ms Rowling  did not disappoint!  This book was as thrilling and complex as book 3.  It's exciting to keep finding out more about the wizarding world through  Harry's eyes.  This book answers alot of questions about Harry's past but  asks alot more as well.  The adults know alot more about Harry's family  then they are telling him.  I guess we will have to wait for future books  to answer those questions.<br />In the meantime Ms. Rowling again adds vivid  details to this world, and leaves the reader wanting to know when Book 5  will be published. I loved the little jokes and comments on Wizard politics  and work.  And the bathroom alone is enough to make you want to be a  prefect.<br />These books are great for anyone, you don't have to be a child  to love Harry Potter.  I hope Ms. Rowling doens't stop writing about this  world once Harry graduates.<br />And 5 stars to Amazon for sending the the  book Fedex! It was great to get the book the same day!
