I gave 5 stars just for the quality of the artwork alone! This is a beautiful book that's a must have for any Harry Potter fan young or old! However, the fact that the book is printed and bound in CHINA is ridiculous and I was very irritated when I realized this. Perhaps the binding quality and bookmark ribbon would have been better if a little more care and attention were applied. In the book I received, my ribbon bookmark was folded over in a few areas which left many creases in several of the pages! That's really annoying considering this is more of a collectors item for me. I would have paid extra to have a better quality book so, with the cost of this book being rather low then I guess you get what you pay for. Also, the way Amazon shipped this book to me was appalling! The slip jacket of my book now has some slight damage and there are some areas where there was some rubbing and it actually looks like someone has picked it up with greasy fingers. Very disappointed with that but it seems that the shipping quality for most of Amazon items is rather on the poor side anyway. This book could have easily been wrapped in shrink wrap and they could have added bubble wrap as well. I mean, really?!? Even with all of those negatives aside, please don't let that deter you from buying this book!! As I said the artwork is phenomenal and it's a great piece of art to show off. I'm going to get a copy for my young nephew as well! I can't wait until the rest of the series is released! They are releasing a special collectors edition of this first book in November which is $200+ and I've already pre-ordered it so check that out too! I hope that it will be of much better quality and it's NOT printed in China however it's not in the U.S. either!
