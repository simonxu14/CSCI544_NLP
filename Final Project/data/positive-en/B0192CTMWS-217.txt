This entire series is my very favorite set of books & I've read thousands (no lie!).  The storyline is the best modern example of good vs evil & the character development is without compare.  I've read the series dozens of times & have them in hardback, paperback & now audiobook formats.  I'm also collecting the illustrated versions & of course the dvds.  I enjoy so much listening to the books while driving to & from work & makes that so much less of a chore, too.
