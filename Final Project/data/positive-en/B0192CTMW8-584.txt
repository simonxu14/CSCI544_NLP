Wow, this book came out fifteen years ago (I'm old!). While only the second book in the Harry Potter series, I feel as if this is a great start to the furthering of Potter's career at Hogwarts. The Chamber of Secrets leaves much room for curiosity as the book goes on, and is full of interesting content about the chamber and its history.
