One of the great aspects of the first few Harry Potter books is that they could be shared by both children and adults but on different levels.  Since book 5, this had ceased to be true.  The latest and final book, The Deathly Hallows has more violence than a season of the Soprano's. Increased violence also seemed to have made the humor that we have grown to love, absent which was sad because it was an integral part of the success of the books.<br /><br />Who among us doesn't feel a sense of loss that the last book has been written?  I sure do but with the exception of Book 5, this was the toughest one to get through.  Yes, there were parts that kept me up hours past bedtime but there were also parts that were a chore to read.  I have no problem with the long books but I didn't find it necessary to say what has already been said a thousand time over.  As a whole, Harry Potter has made an unprecedented positive impact on the publishing industry and in our hearts.  As many, I love Harry Potter but I have to be truthful - just swallowed some Veriserum (sic)and state that this was not quite the experience I wanted from the last HP book.  Yes, it was full of adventure, and a few satisfying conclusions but there was also something lacking.  Without including spoilers, I won't go into specifics but it is quite a story and if you've been through the journey thus far, there is no way you won't travel down the last road in the realm of HP.  Goodbye to the unparalleled Harry Potter series.  We won't forget time well spent.
