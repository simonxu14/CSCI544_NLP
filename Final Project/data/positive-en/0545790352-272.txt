Gorgeous book that I am absolutely thrilled to have on my shelf, as an illustrator I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of the printing as well as the sheer volume of illustrations in this book. I did not expect this to be as fully and beautifully illustrated as it was, and everything was set up with a distinct regard to story flow and color theory. I hope they make more books in this manner, as my shelves would be full to bursting.
