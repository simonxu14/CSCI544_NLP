These are great books one of my absolute favorite series! They are so captivating, these books are for any age! I would recommend reading the books before seeing the movies of course you get more out of it! J.K. Rowling is so clever the books is very original and well thought out. Over the series you really get to know the characters and she does a great job keeping you interested in the books!
