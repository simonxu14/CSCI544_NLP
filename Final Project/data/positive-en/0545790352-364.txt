This was a gift for my wife for Christmas.<br />The shipping was very good, and the product came undamaged, wrapped securely in its box.<br /><br />The book itself is very well done with every other pages or so with an illustration.<br />My wife was thrilled with it and looks forward to delicately flipping through the pages!
