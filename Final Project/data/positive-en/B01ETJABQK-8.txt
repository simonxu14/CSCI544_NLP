I've never read a book in screenplay format before, I steered clear of HP and the Cursed Child for that very reason. For Potterheads worried that Fantastic Beasts will be another Harry Potter fan fiction that messes with your view of the original characters, fear not. Fantastic Beasts occurs decades before little Harry was born, and involves very different themes. While the original HP series revolved around one hero and his fight against the all powerful You Know Who, Fantastic Beasts seemed more lighthearted without being childish.<br /><br />This particular cast of characters was a pleasure to get to know. I loved seeing Muggles other than the Dursleys in the wizarding world. There's Newt Scamander, a magic zoologist, dorky and loveable. There's Jacob Kowalski, a bumbling Muggle caught up in the mess, learning about the magical world as we do. And then there are Tina and Queenie, beautiful, talented, charming and kindhearted sisters, stuck in menial positions in the wizarding world and wanting more.<br /><br />This screenplay is wonderful because we get to visit the rich detailed wizarding world again. It was wonderful to see the magical creatures Harry learned about on the written page again. It was wonderful feeling that sense of anticipation opening a new Rowling novel again knowing you won't be able to do anything but read for the next 8 hours. The play was fun, witty, and just brilliant. The hardcover copy is beautiful and will go well with my hardcover copies of the original HP series. I would definitely recommend this book to new HP readers and Potterheads alike.
