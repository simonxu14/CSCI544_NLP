This was a great conclusion to a great series.In all 7,we see good struggling with evil.We see the good working together to overcome all the obstacles placed in their but they keep struggling. Good wins in the end but only have a united effort. This is a wonderful series and I hope all will read it thoughtfully. Especially,young people--and it wont hurt old people,like me, also.
