Great way to end the series!  Were YOUR predictions true? Did you pick up on the clues along the way?  This book is action packed and, like the others, will keep you guessing and reading.  One part is reminiscent of The Lord of the Rings.  However, it quickly/thankfully goes in its own direction. The epilogue is a bit hokey, but entertaining none the less.  You'll feel satisfied when all your questions have been answered, for better or worse. I was worried this last book would be a disappointment. I was very pleased as it was a joy!  Bravo to Amazon for getting it to me on the release date!
