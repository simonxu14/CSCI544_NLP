I was so excited to get my copy of Goblet of Fire on Saturday (thanks Amazon).  I was not disappointed with this book at all.  In the style of the previous books in the series, it was engaging and entertaining and a  real page-turner.  I read the whole 700+ page book in a weekend because I  was enjoying it so much.  Many of the beloved characters from previous  books are back, and the new characters added are very entertaining,  particularly the new Defense Against Dark Arts teacher.  If you haven't  bought this book yet, get it now!  A great read for children and adults  alike, I would recommend it to anyone.
