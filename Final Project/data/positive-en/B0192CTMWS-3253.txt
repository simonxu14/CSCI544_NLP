In anticipation of the book I reread the first six books - as did a lot of people, I imagine - and it was really great to see the development of the characters, leading up to this finale.  The book did ramble around a bit - there were parts where I was just SLIGHTLY bored - but it was worth getting through that to get to the ending, and have the mysteries answered.  Played around with my emotions, and left me feeling full and satisfied (but emotionally drained after 22 hours of reading).  Will be read many many times!
