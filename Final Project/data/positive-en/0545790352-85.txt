This is the first time we've read the series (I know, I know, we must be the last remaining people who have not read them).  My 5-year-old and I both love the book!  The illustrations are fantastic!  It's nice to have never seen the movies and to just have these images as our first interpretation of the delightful events and story.  Fantastic book!  I'm really looking forward to getting the next one in October.  Bummed that we have to wait so long to get each book, but it will be a treasure to keep for sure.
