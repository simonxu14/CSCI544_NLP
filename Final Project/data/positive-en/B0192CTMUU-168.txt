Yet another masterpiece bi J.K. Rowling.  When I first read this book several years ago I couldn't stop grinning throughout most of the first half. Humor, drama, a little bit of romance, I stayed up well past one in the morning huddled under my sheets with a flashlight reading page after page. If you haven't already read this, you're missing out.
