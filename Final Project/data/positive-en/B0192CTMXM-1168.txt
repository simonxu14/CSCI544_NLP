This is probably one of the best in the HP series! I won't spoil anything for the readers but I'll tell you that this story is so much more emotional than the previous books. The consequences are much more permanent and many characters from the previous books reappear and some have much larger roles. This book was worth the wait and I can't wait til book 6 comes out! Any fan of HP should get this now! Excellent!!
