My 7yo is obsesssd with Pok&eacute;mon Go and reads this book every day. She got it for her bday 6 weeks ago and still reads it daily. A MUST HAVE for any kid who is crazy about Pok&eacute;mon. The pages are smooth and glossy and the pics are nice and bright. It essentially has a pic of every Pok&eacute;mon that exists and why they evolve into or evolve from and a little blurb about each one. I would expect a book this thick to be more expensive!
