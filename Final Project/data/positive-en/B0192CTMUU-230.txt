I won't ruin the plot for those of you who have not yet readthe book, but I want to emphasize that the series keeps getting betterand better.  &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; is absolutely gripping -- you will probably find it difficult if not impossible to put down.<br />I am increasingly impressed by J.K. Rowling's ability to weave together so many disparate details to create these amazing tapestries of wizarding life.  She develops seemingly minor details mentioned in the first three books into elements integral to the plot.<br />One warning for younger readers and their parents: Rowling wasn't kidding when she said the ending is scary.  I suggest finishing the book during daylight hours to allow some lagtime before bedtime.  E ND
