Each book gets exponentially better. Book four is grand, rich, spectacular, & brilliant. You really are getting really deep into the Harry Potter world by the end of this book. It's great that it is long because there is more room for dialogues, mystery, suspense, action, all sorts of emotions, & other surprises. Dumbledore & Sirius have really got Harry's back. The Tri-Wizard Tournament is awesome. Harry is brave & strong. Fleur Delacour is a total hottie. Clemency Po&eacute;sy plays her role in the movie version. It is magnificent how J.K. Rowling captures the accents of Madame Maxime, Fleur, Krum and of course Hagrid as always. It does give for more interesting dialogue, and makes it authentic. Expect the unexpected, your mind will be blown by the end of the book. I give this 101 out of 100 points.
