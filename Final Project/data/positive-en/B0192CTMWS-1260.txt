It's a great story, with much more detail and interest than the movie that was based on it.  Jim Dale's performance is excellent and really brings life to the characters.<br /><br />I took off one star because one of the disks was scratched & Amazon cowered behind their policy that they would not allow an exchange of an audio product that was opened.
