Oh my gosh this is a great book! In the past week I have read it twice Isn't that a record or what! Harry Potter and the goblet of fire is a great book for all of you who belive that anything is possible, want an adventure story, or if your'e just looking for a good read! I recommend it for all ages but it even gave my mom a spook!And when i ask people what they're favorite book is from every corner of the neighborhood, I hear Harry Potter, year four.
