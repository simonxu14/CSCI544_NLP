Aside from the 7th book (and final...I'm still sad about that), this was my absolute favorite book in the HP series.  There were so many twists and turns and well, I simply loved it!  When I first saw the book, I compared the size to Prizoner of Azkaban and wow.  I didn't think I'd have time to read it, but once I started (granted, the beginning was a bit slow), I couldn't put the book down and I ended up reading it in about two weeks (I'm a preschool teacher so I don't get much time to myself!).  Since I began reading the series late, book 5 had already been published (as had book 6) so I immediately went on to read those two.<br /><br />Anyway, back to GOF...it's just amazing; J.K. puts so much depth into each and every one of her characters, no matter how minor they may be.  That is one of the things that keeps me reading these books over and over again.  Anyway, if you're looking for something good to read, I highly suggest this...but read the other three first. ;)  Just a suggestion. :)
