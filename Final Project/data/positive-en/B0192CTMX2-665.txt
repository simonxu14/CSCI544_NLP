I currently have the recordings to book 1-5, all have been excellent! I was especially looking forward to the reading of book 5 - when I read the book myself (when it first came out) I found it hard to read at times because Harry seemed so ANGRY all the time - so I was really looking forward to the experience of having someone else read it to me :) At first I found some of the voices (for certain characters) a bit distracting but by book 5 I have gotten use to this.<br /><br />I have never purchased books on CD before but I love the HP series, so these seemed a good choice. Originally I got them to help me fall asleep at night but I often find I stay awake listening to the end of the CD - so I am not sure they were a success from that regard!<br /><br />Book 5 has so much plot and side stories in it that (In my opinion) it was really nice to sit back and have someone else do all the work and just listen! I would not pick listening to the CD's over reading the books myself but the CD's are an excellent addition to my HP collection and I would say I enjoy them more than the movies - not to take anything away from the movies (Well with the exception of the third movie anyhow ....)<br /><br />If you are a non-reader interested in having the full HP experience than I highly recommend purchasing the CD's
