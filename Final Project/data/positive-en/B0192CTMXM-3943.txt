I thoroughly enjoyed this book, it brought together many of the outstanding questions from the other six books and was well edited an written.  Spelling and grammar mistakes tend to jump out at me as I read them but I cannot recall a single occurrence of these types of errors in the book.  There were a few sentences that I had to read a few times to get the meaning right but they were not errors, just a tricky way of saying something.<br /><br />All in all, this is a spectacular end to a phenomenal series.  I look forward to any future work the author may produce.
