I am roughly 4.2 times older than the recommended age group for this book- and I adored it.  Inventive, sly, humorous, and great fun- as well as scary in parts, sneaky in others.  Very well written without a trace of  condescension for the audience.  I highly recommend this book. Yes, a 9  year old can read it him/herself, but I read it aloud to my 41/2 year old  granddaughter, and she was enraptured with it.  A GREAT read aloud book.  Cannot wait for Harry's second year at Hogwarts- and isn't that the PERFECT  name for a boarding school?
