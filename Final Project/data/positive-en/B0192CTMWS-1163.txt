There is a lot of action and twists and turns.  Everyone that Harry has had contact with in the last six years has to be dealt with and resolved in some way.  I think Rowling did an excellent job of remaining true and still giving a sense of realism to a fiction book.  Not everything turned out neat and clean and some of our favorites didn't make it, but that's life, whether you are at Hogwarts or in Muggle world.
