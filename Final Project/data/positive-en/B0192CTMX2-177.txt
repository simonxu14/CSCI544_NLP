At the time of this writing, there are only five of seven books published.<br /><br />This is my favorite.  I have read this numerous times (including in Spanish) and I am over 30 (if that matters). This story is particularly dark.  The whole premise of the book is that Harry is being sought by a known murderer (and one who, no less, betrayed Harry's parents and is the cause of their deaths). So much happens in this story to test Harry's resolve.  A pack of dementors--Azkaban prison's guards--surround the school in an attempt to catch the murderer (Sirius Black).  These guard cause Harry a tremendous amount of grief.<br /><br />The storyline is fascinating. We get further background information on the wizarding world and, more importantly, on Harry. We are introduced to some new magic, new spells, and some new creatures.<br /><br />This is the book that will show you that this series has the power, the strength, and the story to carry it through seven books.<br /><br />If you decide you cannot commit to seven books or to worrying about some kid you don't know, consider reading just this one--even if it is out of order--before you quit the whole series.  This book is that good.
