In the second book of the Harry Potter series Rowling takes Harry back to Hogwarts in the form of a flying car that the Weasley boys "borrow" from their Father as they spirit Harry away from his evermore sour tempered relatives the Dursley's who would like nothing better than to see Harry magically make himself permanently disappear. In his new year at school Harry, and his two best friends face many new obstacles as they become detectives and sleuth around the spiraling stairways and dark corners of Hogwarts trying to figure out who is attacking students and leaving cryptic messages on the walls; One of them even being accused and another attacked!<br /><br />This installment in the series is full of adventure and kept me turning the pages, it was a bit fast  paced and the ending could have been spread out more, and explained in more detail as far as the details but in all I enjoyed the book, and am looking forward to continuing the series.
