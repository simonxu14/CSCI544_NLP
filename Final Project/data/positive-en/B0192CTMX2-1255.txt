As always, a treat to hear Jim Dale's voices again.  I was impressed with the packaging on this CD set:  folders of three or four CD's were sectioned together using different color/designs on top, so there was never a question as to what CD I was listening to.  (All my other HP audios are on cassette tapes).  Here's hoping JK writes more very soon!
