I love the entire Harry Potter series.  It transports the reader to a fantasy world full of mystery and intrigue, yet is appropriate and enjoyable for all ages.  To have this book in a leather-bound collector's edition makes it even more special.  I only wish all of the volumes were published this way.  This particular edition is leatherbound with gilt-covered page edges and comes with a protective clear sleeve cover.  I found my experience with the seller on Amazon to be very professional and pleasant.  I appreciate the fast shipping and quality customer service.
