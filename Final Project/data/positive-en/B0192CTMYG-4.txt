Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone<br />ISBN: 0590353403<br /><br />How did Harry Potter become a household word?<br /><br />I am intrigued by the phenomena of Harry Potter, and this review is a writer / editor's perspective.  The plot and characters are well known and described in many reviews, so I will not address them.<br /><br />I purchased all four books over two years ago, but they sat on my shelf unread.  Then, I was away from home without a book, and a friend loaned me her copy of The Sorcerer's Stone.  Within two weeks, I read all four books.  Why?<br /><br />J. K. Rowlings captures the imagination with prose that draws her readers in.  Details that are not in the movie, such as Harry's hair that stayed one length no matter how often it was cut, which showed that he was a wizard, but did not know it.<br /><br />* He was different from his peer group; isolated in a world of Muggles.  Children often feel isolated and mistreated, as do adults, therefore most people can relate to this situation.<br />* He is an orphan who believes his parents died in a car crash, and he has no pictures of them.  He longs to belong, an emotion that is common in all ages.<br />* His room was a closet under the stairs, he never received gifts or a kind word, and was viewed as something to get through by his guardians.  In reality, anyone treated like this is abused.  Yet Harry kept a positive attitude, and enjoyed the privacy the room gave him.  He made the best of bad circumstances.<br />* His cousin was a pampered slob, but he was created by his parents' overindulgent behavior.  He received 36 presents for his birthday, but it was not enough.  Things do not replace guardianship.<br />* Harry, small for his age, was the object of ridicule.  Magic delivered him.  Who does not dream of a magical solution to their problems?  This is a writer's tool known as "deus ex machina" or "God out of a machine."<br />* Commonly, in editing, this is the "hand of God" tool.  It is generally used in an unconvincing plot, character, or event, however, Rowlings success is because she foreshadowed the magic as part of Harry's character through the lightning bolt scar on his forehead.<br />* Using this plot device "whereby a seemingly inextricable problem is suddenly and abruptly solved with the contrived and unexpected intervention of some new event, character, ability, or object" is a writer's tool.<br /><br />Other aspects of the writing itself are:<br />* Rowlings does not talk down to her audience of young adults.<br />* The same story elements that appeal to a child, appeal to an adult; and the book is unique and readable.<br />* Her characters grow, change, and make decisions based on their own motives.<br />* Life is not simple; people do die.<br />* Good and evil exist, as they do in reality, in many guises.<br />* She takes time to set up the characters, plot, and scenes.  I wondered why she dedicated so many pages to Privet Drive.  This introduced Harry, and because we know how he is treated, we know why Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry immediately becomes his home.  He was wanted.<br />* It is easy to read.  The text flows naturally, even with strange words and unusual names.<br />* Her creativity and descriptions bring life to the story, and you want to know what happens next.<br /><br />Rowlings did not expect her marvelous story to capture readers from all age groups.  She was surprised to be compared to L.Frank Baum who wrote the Wizard of Oz.<br /><br />Now I, like million of J. K. Rowlings fans from all over the world, anxiously await the next book.  Thus, Harry Potter, became a household word.<br /><br />Victoria Tarrani
