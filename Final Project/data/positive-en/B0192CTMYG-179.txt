Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first book in a series of seven that tells the story of a young boy who is orphaned as a baby when his parents are killed by a dark wizard who tries to kill Harry too, but Harry survives the attack and all he is left with is a scar on his forehead that identifies him as the only living wizard known to be able to survive Voldemort.  After the attack as a baby is sent to live with his human or "muggle" relatives where for ten years, he is never told he is a wizard; and he receives harsh and cold treatment from them because they desperately want to fit into the "normal" world and Harry is anything but ordinary.<br /><br />Harry only finds out about his past ,his wizard lineage, and how his parents died, when he gets his letter from Hogwarts; an academy for young wizards and witches. Then the real adventure begins, as Harry discovers a world of magic, makes friends, and enters a world where instead of being invisible, he is a virtual celebrity and his name is known by every magical being he comes into contact with.  This was a charming first book to kick off the series and I enjoyed it much more than I expected to. The characters were very easy to picture as you read the book, and the plot was exciting enough that even if you had never heard of the movie or had an idea beforehand of what was going to happen you would want to continue to read because the story was very well written.
