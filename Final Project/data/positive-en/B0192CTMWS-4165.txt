Oh, the blogs will blog on, and the Muggles will grope and grumble.  It matters not.  What Rowling has done here has only been done a few times before in the history of literature, and it will, I am certain, stand for all time.  Think of the Land of Oz, of Narnia, of Middle-Earth, or Ursula LeGuin's Earthsea series.  To create a "really truly live place" is not a feat easily done, but there is one trick that's even harder: to finish it.  Poor L. Frank Baum was forced to slog away at an Oz book a year, and went bankrupt when he tried to stop; in his twilight years the books went on, half-heartedly, none of them as good as the first three.  Tolkien died before he could finish his great design, though his drafts and sketches have filled more than a dozen volumes.  Conan Doyle tried to rid himself of Sherlock Holmes to no avail.  To create a world, a world beloved by children and adults alike, and a world which unfolds with a beginning, a middle, and an end -- that is the most difficult of all tasks, and Rowling has done it.  The book's ending is wholly and completely satisfying, and there is not remedy for it but -- to begin again!
