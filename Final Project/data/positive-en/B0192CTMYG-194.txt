(This was written by my 7 year old daughter): The Sorcerer`s Stone is the best book I have ever read!!! It in involves dying . There are 3 best friends Harry, Ron, and Hermiane . They are at a school called Hogwarts for wizards and witches. There are four houses Griffandor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slitherin. They are houses for students to live in at school. They go on adventures that involve magic and mysteries. I recommend this book for ages 7 and up.Don`t watch the movie before you read the book.
