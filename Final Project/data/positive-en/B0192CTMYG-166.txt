Back when I was relatively young (mid 20s), I read a book by Stephen King called &#34;On Writing.&#34; At the back of that non-fiction book, he had a list of a lot of his recommended books, and among others it listed the 1st 3 Harry Potter books. I was kind of surprised because even though I knew they were wildly popular at that time, I also knew that they were just children's books. I still hadn't made up my mind to read them yet, until I saw the trailer to the first movie. I decided to take a chance and buy and read the first book just to see if all the hype was real. I was hooked by the end of the first chapter, and read the whole book in just 1 day. The next day i went back to the store to buy books 2 and 3, the only ones on paperback at that time, and finished those 2 in another 3 days. I tried really hard to wait for paperback on book 4, but I just couldn't do it, and I bought the 4th in hardcover and it took 2 or 3 days (it's pretty long). Needless to say, I think this was the best book series I have ever read, and book 1 is a great beginning to an epic tale. Highly recommended.
