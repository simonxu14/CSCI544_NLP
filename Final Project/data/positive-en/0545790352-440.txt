WOW! What a beautiful high quality book. I purchased this for my soon-to-be 7 year old for Christmas and I'm tempted to just loan it to her so she doesn't take off with it when she leaves home. The illustrations are superb and I was shocked at the size and quality of the paper. It's books like this that make owning the real deal better than a kindle.
