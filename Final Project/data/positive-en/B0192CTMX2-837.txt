As with prior novels, Rowling has successfully crafted a story reflecting Harry's age: currently, his struggles through adolescence. Rowling reduces the contrast in Harry's perception of his world, forcing him, and the reader, to see it in an ever-increasing range of grays. This is most pronounced in how the relationships mature, leading to some of the most wonderfully dramatic moments yet seen in the series as friendships and loyalties are tested and characters are suddenly seen in new, and often disillusioning, lights. Rowling delivers the reader to several new locales, each beautifully described and wonderfully imaginative, adding some appreciated variety. The book also wastes no time in placing the reader in the action and the lengthy 870 page journey, while perhaps a bit too tidy in the end, seems no longer than it should. Rowling delivers perhaps the most touching and honest volume in the series.
