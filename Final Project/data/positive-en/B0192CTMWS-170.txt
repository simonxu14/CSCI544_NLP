This is my least favorite of the series--Not because of a poorly written story, but because of the emotional issues Harry has to face. I especially dislike the way Dumbledore handles the situation, basically abandoning poor Harry. However, those issues have nothing to do with  a lack of excellent story telling on Rowling's part. It has everything to do with the way the story stirred my emotions. I absolutely love to loathe Professor Umbridge.
