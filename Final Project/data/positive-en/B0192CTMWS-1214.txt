I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed listening to the last book in the Harry Potter series on CD.  My fiance and I listened to the sixth book during our Thanksgiving travels, which were considerable, and started to listen to the seventh book this Christmas.  We are only up to half of the story and are so bummed that our travels are over b/c we want to finish the book!
