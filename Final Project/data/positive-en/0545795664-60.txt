My son is a big fan of pokemons. And this book really has tones of informations about them. You can easily find the one you're looking for since they are all by alphabetical order.<br />I do feel like something still missing in it. It would have been nice to have a section with the different types of pokemons with agains what other types they are better or weaker.
