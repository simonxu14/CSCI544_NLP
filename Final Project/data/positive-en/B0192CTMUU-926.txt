The book is very clever and entertaining. But as it isapparently, targeted to kids aged 9 to 11, I wonder why J.K. Rowlingopted to make it 734 pages long. I've never met a kid that age who had ever, or would ever, tackle a novel of that intimidating length. I'd love to do a poll 6 months from now and find out how many kids actually managed to finish &quot;Goblet of Fire.&quot; My prediction is that it would be less than 5%--if that.  Sorry to toss water on everyone's blockbuster publishing event. It just strikes me as a little bit weird.
