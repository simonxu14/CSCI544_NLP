This is without a doubt the most beautifully and artistically rendered printed version of HP and the Sorcerer's Stone. The art is striking and really captures each character. This is almost in the category of a coffee table art book, I did not expect it to be a big book. This is the kind of book you give to a HP fan, or for your kids first HP book, it will last ages and will be treasured no doubt.
