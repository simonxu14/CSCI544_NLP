-No spoilers here-<br />While reading the final pages of "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows", one is overcome with a bittersweet feeling... part of you pushing on to the very last page to see Harry's fate, but part of you longing to take a step back... because you know these are the last words of Harry you'll ever read. Of course, the latter never prevails. Rowling takes you so in depth and on the edge of your seat with her masterful skill and talent that you cannot help but soak in every last drop and re-read the last line in the bitter hopes that another few sentences will appear out of no where so you don't have to say goodbye to Harry and the gang.<br /><br />This conclusion to the "epic tale of Harry Potter" is remarkably dark and mature, showing that Harry has grown along with its readers, which was incredibly brave of Rowling to undertake. The maturity of the text is showing us that Harry has not just grown up a year since the last book, but that he's turned into a man with mature and life-threatening decisions he must make.<br />Yes, there are deaths. Yes, there are tears. Yes, it is violent. But one gobbles it all up, and is thankful for the privilege. If you have not read "Deathly Hallows" yet and have not been spoiled by the media and have not yet heard the ending, you may be tempted to peek at the end to see Harry's fate, but don't! This is a 700 page journey you don't want to spoil by peeking!
