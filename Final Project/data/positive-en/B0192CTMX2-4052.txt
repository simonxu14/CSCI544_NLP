I think JKR did a very good job wrapping up a 7 book series into a readable book.  Many people are screaming about unfinished story lines, but if she'd closed absolutely everything she ever wrote about in the first 6 books, this final novel would have been larger then the rest combined and completely unreadable.  What is important is that she closed the major story lines for all of the major characters.  And look at it this way, she left things open just enough to not leave you hanging, but for there to be the possibility of future books in the series.<br /><br />As for the many people I see whining about how there was no 'true love' in the book.  I think they should recheck their definition of true love.  No, it did not have 'true love' as you see it in Disney Princess flicks.  What DH did show is the true love that can develop, without any romantic attachment, between friends, collegues, students and teachers.  And that is the true type of love this world actually needs more of, not the fairytale romance loves of Disney.<br /><br />I only gave her four stars, though, as I was a bit dissappointed with a couple of facets.<br /><br />I think the romance blooming between Ron and Hermione could have been better written.  But perhaps JKR is not comfortable with writing romance, and that is why it takes such a back seat.  I would hate to have to try and write a believable love story with such developed characters.<br /><br />I also think the very small amount of swearing that was in the book could have been left out, and was used as a cheap shock tactic (most specifically Mrs. Weasley's line towards the end).  But as JKR did not go overboard with this tactic (I only recall it being used two or three times), I did not think it pulled the overall value of the book down too much.<br /><br />Overall, an enjoyable read and a good wrapper upper to a very long and complicated series.  Of course, not everyone will be happy, but as long as the majority are, that's what counts to an author.  Grammar and syntax are not everything, it's the sharing of creativity and new ideas that makes a fictional book a good read.
