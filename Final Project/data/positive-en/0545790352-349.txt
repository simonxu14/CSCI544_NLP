I bought this book for my 10 year old daughter. She loves Harry Potter and was very intrigued by the idea of illustrations. The book did not disappoint. The drawings are lovingly done and very consistent with the story. The text is true to the original. The book has a nice weight and the paper is a nice thickness. Your Harry Potter fan will not be disappointed.
