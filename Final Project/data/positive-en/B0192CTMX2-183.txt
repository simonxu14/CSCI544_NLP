Fans of the series may very well enjoy the many plot twists and turns as Harry and his two friends attempt to destroy the horcruxes revealed in the Half Blood Prince (book 6). Many times, the characters aren't in agreement and there are a few times when it seems hopeless. The Voldemort-Potter relationship becomes clearer and is used by the Dark Lord to play mind games with Harry. JK Rowling does indeed answer a lot of questions lingering from the previous books and a couple generated in the text of this one. Most elements are resolved one scene at a time, however she does employ lengthier discourses in the second half of the book to explain the purpose of significant characters. The only problems with the story itself being for youthful readers are the shifting of most of the plot away from Hogwarts and the implied use of vulgarities by several characters. I'm sure no one missed the frequent "effing". Other than that, the book is sure to keep many people busy reading for a week or two.
