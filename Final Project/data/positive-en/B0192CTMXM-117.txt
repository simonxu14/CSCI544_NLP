How can you not love this book? If you are a fan of the earlier books in the series - stop reading this review, and go read the Deathly Hallows. This is the perfect conclusion to the series I grew up with, and any fan of mystery, adventure, loyalty, and magic will appreciate the incredible ending that J.K. Rowling has crafted.
