Beautiful illustrations, and nary a typo. Love the built in ribbon bookmark. The size of the book is perfect for reading, but of course does not match anything else on the shelf - until I get all the rest as they are released! A must have for any Potter fan. I particularly like the illustrations of Dudley's baby pictures. My four year old actually was engaged enough thanks to the illustrations to allow me to read the whole story to her over the course of 2 weeks at bed time. I loved this since I could share Potter with her a lot sooner than I would have been able to with the original format.
