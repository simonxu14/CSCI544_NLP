If you've ever read any of the Harry Potter series, you HAVE to read the last book. In my opinion, it's the best book of the whole series. This book wraps up all the open-ended questions that you may of had while reading the other books of the series. Many parts of the book were just so touching. Especially toward the end...but no spoilers!
