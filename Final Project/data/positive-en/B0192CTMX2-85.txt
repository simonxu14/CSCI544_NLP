I try to avoid duplicating comments in prior reviews in general & with this book the number of reviews is fast approaching the number of pages in the book--759!  Awesome.  As the final work in a series of 7, this book must be understood in context - of the other books.  The set is an epic tale in a magical & mysterious world--the author stresses many things--mystery (keeping the readers guessing), fantasy (magic & muggles), adolescent life (snogging & infatuations), etc.--BUT relating them to real life through symbol & allegory (muggle hatred & mudblood discrimination).  Per Joseph Campbell's works&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Hero-with-a-Thousand-Faces-Paladin-Books/dp/0586085718/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Hero with a Thousand Faces (Paladin Books)</a>, its outward theme is a hero's quest--with both human & magical helpers--Harry isn't Superman & Hermione isn't Supergirl.  See also the wonderful works of Allan Chinen&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Beyond-the-Hero-Classic-Stories-of-Men-in-Search-of-Soul/dp/0738851566/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Beyond the Hero: Classic Stories of Men in Search of Soul</a>&nbsp;& Marie-Louise von Franz&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Individuation-in-Fairy-Tales-C-G-Jung-Foundation-Books/dp/1570626138/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Individuation in Fairy Tales (C. G. Jung Foundation Books)</a>&nbsp;on the psychological value of fairy tales.  Of course, this involves a struggle against evil & dark forces similar to Tolkien's works & many others (e.g. E. R. Eddison&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Worm-Ouroboros/dp/0486447405/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Worm Ouroboros</a>).  But our author is multidimensional--aiming apparently at a VERY wide range of readers of varying ages.  Thus, it must be many-leveled to reach them.  Indeed, it is.  Many of the characters seemingly one-dimensionally good or evil, turn out to be deeper than that--like the Taoist yin-yang symbol, there's a dot of white in the black ½ & a dot of black in the white ½--very archetypal.  Thus, it is not surprising to have a wedding in the middle of violent upheaval--like the Buddhist story of the person falling over a cliff when pursued by wolves who clings to a plant being chewed by a rat.  She reaches over to pluck a strawberry to eat & savor even though death is imminent.  Enjoy what you can, when you can.  There is considerable death in this book too.  Such struggles require it.  But death is not the opposite of life.  Death is the opposite of birth--as shown in the Epilogue.  Life includes both.  It's a cycle.  Yes, there is a "Greater good" but (as shown in this book) one MUST be entirely selfless to discern what that is.  Even Dumbledore had something to learn!<br /><br />In addition, there are some great lines in this book:<br />p. 381: Her voice was now so shrill only bats would be able to hear it soon.<br />p. 388: Harry felt like the only non-mourner at a poorly attended funeral.<br />p. 718: Those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it.<br /><br />Many will quickly read through this book in a "few" hours.  I suggest you do NOT.  Read it slowly & savor it.  Experience the slow parts with patience--they may be trying to teach you something--& the violence with compassion.  The world is the way the world is, not the way we want it to be, and to change yourself is to change the world.  Have a great read!
