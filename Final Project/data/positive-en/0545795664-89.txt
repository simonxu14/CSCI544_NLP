Our boys all love this book.  We have 4 sons and work hard to teach them about sharing and that they won't always have what one of their brother's have.  As a result, even with gifts there is power in having possession of the object.  With this book, the boys were sleeping with the first copy, carrying it into the bathroom, lugging it to school, it was a constant battle.  Typically a new toy or book gets a few days old and loses its &#34;battle appeal&#34; unless it has been stored away for a period of time and comes out once again making it new.  Didn't happen with this book so we ordered one for each boy, which turned out to be fair as they each handle and care for their personal property differently.  Now they sit down together and have Pokemon battles, citing to the evolutions in the book.  Even though we bought 4 of these books, we saved a ton of money and hassle because each book is cheaper than a box of Pokemon cards without the litter potential of the cards.  These books have really added a spark to our children's imagination and allows for easy game play.
