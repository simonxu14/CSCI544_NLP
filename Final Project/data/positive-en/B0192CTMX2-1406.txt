I guess if Cedric Diggory had just keeled over of a heart attack that would have been just death and GRIEF.  In fact, he was senselessly killed because he was in the way of someone who is questing for power at any cost. So I'd say that has to qualify as evil.  And Harry is no longer "sweet, heroic Harry."  Well, as Lupin and Sirius told Harry--"the world isn't divided into good people and Death Eaters"[read "bad people."]  Harry isn't perfect, his father wasn't perfect, Dumbledore isn't perfect--and Snape isn't entirely bad. (Although Malfoy IS entirely bad--and he's getting boring.) That's just reality.  To me it gives depth, complexity, interest, emotion, heart, flesh and blood to the story--within the constraints of children's fantasy novel.  (It ain't Dostoevsky--nor should we expect it to be.)  I do agree however that J.K. Rowling needs to find an editor who can tell her "no."  I agree that the housecleaning went on way too long and that the whole thing should have been a lot tighter.  Still and all I think she's plumbing new and fascinating depths for a children's book.  And it seems to me a lot of the difficulties with this book stem from what seem to be plot set-ups for what's to come.  So I'm waiting to look at all seven books as a whole before I weigh in on the question fully.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I'm anxious for more.
