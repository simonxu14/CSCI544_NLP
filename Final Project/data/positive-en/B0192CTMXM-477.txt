I liked this one because I got a little more of Sirius. Albeit, it does come to a sad end, but he quickly becomes my favorite character even though he's not a main character.  I also enjoy the  Lupin/Tonks budding complications. It's enjoyable. The characters have beautiful depth. Things are getting very serious.
