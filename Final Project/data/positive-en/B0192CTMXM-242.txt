I am an avid reader. I love fantasy, sci-fi, horror and really any good fiction. I put off the Harry Potter series for a long time. My son read them when he was younger, he was about 9-10 yrs old when the first one came out. Perfect Harry Potter age, he enjoyed them and when he moved out i told him to leave the books and i would get to them one of these days. I finally decided to tackle them right when the Deathly Hallows movie came out and it got me excited to finally start them. Well, I was not disappointed. Book 7 being the only book my son didn't have in his collection, I quickly ordered it right after i started 6. I now know what all the fuss was about. It wasn't about jumping on the bandwagon, it was because this was probably the best series of books I have ever read. Plain and simple.
