I am pleased with this book. It has so much valuable information and it has full color graphics and text that is easy to read. One thing that disappointed me though was that it does not list what generation each Pokemon is and it lists each Pokemon alphabetically; I feel it would be better to group them by generation or type. I often find myself looking up a Pokemon, then having to flip through to find it evolution(s) rather than having them all together. This is sort of annoying. But again, a nice reference for any pokefan.
