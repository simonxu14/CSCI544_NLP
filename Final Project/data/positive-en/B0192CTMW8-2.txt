Reminiscent of C.S. Lewis' Narnia Chronicles, author Rowling is able to create a fantasy world that crosses over both to our physical reality and to the reality of today's children.  This, the second book, of the series, continues the great work she began in &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's  Stone&quot;.<br />This is not a &quot;dumbed-down&quot; book full of silly  witches casting bad spells, or even just the tale of one brave boy facing  an evil wizard.  Rather, it is the tale of a boy who, like so many kids  today, must overcome a troubles home life and the greater mystery of  finding out who he is in order to succeed.<br />Adults take heed - this may be  listed as a children's book, but it keeps selling out my college bookstore  at the University of Pennsylvania!
