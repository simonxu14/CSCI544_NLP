The general Rowling-isms can be found in Order of the Phoenix, just as they should be.  She's still J.K., and she still rocks, and Harry is still our hero, along with Hermione, Ron and all the other biggies...but the flavor, in this book, has subtly shifted.<br />Some won't notice and others will, though some may not be able to put into words what it "is" about this book that's so...well, so "not usual," yet still so "Potter."  Some will express their confusion with disappointment in the turn of events and perhaps even express their dislike of book 5, where still others will embrace this all with entusiasm.  However, a change there definitely is...and it is expected...at this juncture of Harry's adventures.<br />There will be some who may see OOTP as less exciting or fantastic than the others, but Rowling really had no choice, if one is to look at the sequence of events from a logical standpoint.  From the TriWizard tournament to where Harry must go next, Rowling needed a catalyst of sorts.  Book Five is the catalyst. Potter is no longer a kid.  Rowling does the best job I can imagine to convey the turmoil and spacial changes a teen can feel, and I think, the side-effect of this, is that The Order of the Phoenix "sounds" different than the 4 before it.<br />In all, a fantastic transition to "the next phase."  Dark or not, this book, as I see it, is necessary and a wonderful read---one which true Potter (and Rowling) fans will handle beautifully.  The only reason I give this 4 stars, is because a score of 5, for me, wouldn't be genuine.<br />May J.K. continue on with the show.  We'll be here, waiting.
