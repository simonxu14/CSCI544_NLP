This is a fantastic way to end a beloved series . . . and I'm not saying that just because I was right about a lot of things.  If your afraid for the experience to over don't be, Jo will not let you down.  Its still early, so I wont say anything that might spoil anyone's fun, but I do think its one of my favorites of the series.
