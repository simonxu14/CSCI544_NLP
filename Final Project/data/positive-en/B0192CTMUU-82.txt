The countdown is over, and I'm happy to say that Book 4 in the Harry Potter saga was worth every day of the wait. Harry's growing up, and so are Ron and Hermione (I finally learned how to pronounce her name--I'd been reading it wrong).<br />I don't want to give anything away, so I'll just  mention that the plot contains the usual set of surprising twists, with the  addition of a healthy dose of romantic interest, as Harry, Ron, and  Hermione (not to mention Hagrid) start to really notice the opposite  gender. Like &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban,&quot; &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;  contains reminders that the wizarding world is dangerous, scary--and often  unfair, and that not everyone is playing for the same team--or is even  playing the same game. I did start to wonder, towards the end, how Harry  and his friends ever found time to do any actual work (well, besides  Hermione...) with all of their sneaking around the castle late at night.  The Dursleys are as vile as ever; the Weasley's as much fun, and in  general, &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; is like walking  into a roomful of old friends and spending hours (several, at 700+ pages)  catching up on what everyone's been doing. My only question now is: when  will Book 5 be out?
