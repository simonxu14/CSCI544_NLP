This is only the 2nd audio book, I've tried. I thought Jim Dale did a great job. Except for his eastern european and french accents, he was great. I really enjoyed the book this way. Like old time radio, you can do chores, etc.., and still be engrossed, in the story. Another plus would be sharing with a group of people; like a class, or small gathering. These stories are not for the very young though; as the seriousness, and intensity, elevate. I am listening to the 5th book now.
