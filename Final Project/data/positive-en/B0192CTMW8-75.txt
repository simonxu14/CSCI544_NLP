I ordered this book believing it was going to be the Scholastic version, and when it arrived I noticed the package was rather small, and the book inside was thin. When i opened it, I found a Bloomsbury book. Although the content of the text was similar to the Scholastic version, it wasn't expecting to find a Bloomsbury version. It's a good book with a great story, but I wish it would have been true to the product description.
