&quot;Harry&quot; is the &quot;Huck Finn&quot; for the Millenium generation.  Kids as young as 5 years old can listen to this story a chapter at a time and can't wait til the next chapter is read.  Older kids are challenged by vocabulary and newly defined words.  As they grow, they will re-read these books and notice the depth of the story and the eternal struggle of good against evil.  Especially in these trying times, good triumphs over evil, and a child helps to that end...empowerment!  Someday, as parents, they will relate to their offspring by introducing them to our &quot;Harry, Ron, Hermoine, Dumbledore, Snape, Fluffy, Hagrid and then there are the Muggles.......as classic as &quot;Nancy Drew&quot;or the &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; solving mysteries, Harry Potter is a triumph of J.K Rowling's brilliant imagination!
