I purchased this audio book for a road trip I was taking with my 8 year old son and 3 year old daughter.  They both get motion sick so watching movies was not an option for holding their attention.  This was the perfect solution.  All three of us were completely engaged throughout the 8 hours of audio book.  Now I need to go back and read all 8 books again!
