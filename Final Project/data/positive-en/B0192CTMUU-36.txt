In July of 2000 this book was first released and I wondered what all the fuss was about. As a 40 year old adult I wondered who on earth is Harry Potter? My curiosity piqued, I picked up the paper copy of Book 1 and finally start to read it in mid January. It is now mid February and I just finished Book 4, Goblet of Fire. All I can say is Ms. Rowling really knows how to spin a yarn! This was the first time in years I stayed up until 1:30 in the morning with a book on a work night because I couldn't put the book down until I'd finished it. And the illiustrations are wonderful as well.<br />I am so hooked! This delightful series of books brings back memories of my own childhood when you were smaller than everyone else and had to deal with mean teachers and other adults on their level.<br />These books have everything: mystery, drama, pathos, evil relatives, rotten teachers, school bullies and the feeling of flying you get when something in your school child life FINALLY goes right!<br />I will be among the people pre-ordering Book 5 from Amazon when it is avaliable and be standing in the line at the movie theatre in November!<br />Lastly, I'd like to say THANK YOU to Ms. Rowling for giving us a wonderful story that you can read to your grandmother as well as your three year old. Harry Potter is the son we all wish we could have or the child we wish we could have been. By the end of this book I wish I could have traded places with Mrs. Weasley and hugged Harry myself!<br />P.S. And I wish I could administer a nice swift kick to the nether regions of Harry's Aunt and Uncle Dursley. What horrid people! They deserve whatever they get from Harry's magical friends!
