This is not a perfect book. But then again, the Harry Potter series is not a perfect series. It has flaws, though many of them, particularly the two-dimensional villians, are fixed in this, the (apparently... possibly... probably...), final chapter of the series.<br /><br />You already know the plot. There's a decent chance you already know the ending. I knew it before I started to read the book, but despite that fact, I found this an astonishingly good read.<br /><br />J K Rowling's greatest strength as a writer lies in her ability to create a vivid and complete world that exists next to our own. Like our world it has heroes and villians, flaws and successes, triumph and tragedy.<br /><br />The book itself is somewhat more of a weighty read than the previous volumes. I was able to dash through books 1, 2 and 3 in a single sitting. Book four took me a couple days. Books five and six occupied my time for even longer. This book took four days to read. It can't just be breezed through in one easy go.<br /><br />This book plays out like grand opera in many ways. Some of the characters we've grown to know and despise are redeemed, and others we have grown to love have a bit of a dark shadow cast upon them. Questions we've wondered about since the first book are answered (and I was particularly pleased with myself for figuring out what was going on with Dumbledore's fate at the end of the last book), and while the new book does raise up a few new questions, it mostly presents a fine ending to the series.<br /><br />The more adult feel to his particular novel also presents Rowling with a chance to actually use some of the double-entrendes we've all been thinking about since book one (for example a comment about wizards being obsessed with the size of their wands).<br /><br />The book is not without flaws. For much of the book, it seems like we're on a camp-out with the kids. I also wasn't hugely fond of the very end of the book, though I didn't hate it like many other people seem to have. Plus, of course, the slash-fiction fan in me was disapointed that neither Ron nor Draco confessed their true love to Harry, but, oh, well. I think I'll live. :)<br /><br />In the end, this is the best of the Harry Potter books. It's a worthwhile and definate conclusion to the series and great reading. The price tag is a little steep, but thanks to Amazon's deep discount, it's not really all that bad.<br /><br />But really, I'm not sure why I, or anyone else, writes reviews of something like this. The book is bullet-proof. If you've read the first six, you'll read this. If you haven't read them, go back and read them, then come to this one. You'll be happy you did.
