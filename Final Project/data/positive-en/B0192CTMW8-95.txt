Harry Potter, the now 12 year old wizard, had a horrible summer that might have been prevented if a mysterious house-elf named Dobby hadn't appeared in Harry's room with the severe warning not to return to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. Harry ends up locked in his room with no way out. But when Harry's faithful friend Ron and his brothers Fred and George fly a Ford Anglia to his house Harry escapes to the Burrow, the Weasley's home. After a lovely summer with the Weasleys, Harry returns to Hogwarts (With a very rough welcome from a bad tempered Whomping Willow). After the first wonderful school days with Ron and Hermione, an unseen beast from Hogwarts' mysterious past awakens to terrorize, by turning the school's resident muggle borns into petrified statues. Now it's up to Harry, Ron, and Hermione to uncover the Chamber of Secrets, a hidden chamber built by Salazar Slytherin himself. The Chamber is the key to stopping history from repeating itself. But someone-or something-is trying to prevent the discovery of the chamber by trying to take Harry's life. And the residents of the school are not about to help Harry as all the clues hint that he is the prime suspect of the attacks. A cast of wonderful new characters join the old favorites including Gilderoy Lockhart (the self absorbed Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher), Colin Creevy (Harry's biggest, camera carrying, fan) and Lucius Malfoy (Draco Malfoy's trouble making father). "The Chamber of Secrets" is a wonderful follow up to its prequel "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone". It reveals more of everyone's past and their envolvment when the chamber was first opened 50 years ago. I loved this book and I hope it will cast its magical spell on you too.
