As in my review for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, I described how I love the Harry Potter series, so I was glad to find these books for so cheap on Amazon. This book also had a worn cover and binding, as well as some pages that were starting to curl, but the book was in great condition otherwise.
