This is a story of a young boy who is left to live with his undesirous extended family after his father and mother die when he is one year old. His upbringing is not a pleasant one but does not affect Harry Potter negatively. When Harry is older he is whisked away to a school that will teach him wizardry and help him connect to his past. While at school Harry learns skills that help him fight an evil that is forever present. This book was full of adventure, mystery, and entertainment that pulls the reader into the story.<br />  I rated this book 5/5 stars and highly recommend it.
