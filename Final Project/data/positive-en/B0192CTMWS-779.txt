The 5th edition of the Harry Potter series The Order of the Phoenix has all the makings of a classic thriller. Each chapter characteristically ends with intrigue and leaves one unable to put the book down. In this book, He Who Must Not Be Named is Back and in Full Power though for most of the book he does not make any personal appearances. The Order of the Phoenix a secret society of good wizards who fought Voldemort during the first war are revived by Dunmbledore....It is also true that Harry acts like a snot in a good deal of the book, but we see the reason for this near the end of it(at least partially).<br />I highly recommend this book, but note that it is a more personal tale than the others, where we more of Harry's personality and not just his persona. It is also darker than the others at least in the end.<br />Some pieces of it are so well-written you will find yourself repeating them again and again. I will not tel how it ends, but it will leave you wanting more as is characteristic of all Rowling's books.
