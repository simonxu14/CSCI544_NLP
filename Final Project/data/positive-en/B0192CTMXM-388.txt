As usual Jim Dale takes you away with his masterful reading of this final Harry Potter book. The story as you likely know is superb but what you are purchasing is a winning performance by the narrator. You cant get a better solo reading of this story.  The packaging is clever with interesting illustrations. If you have already read the book this CD set will increase your enjoyment of the story.  If this is your first time with the Deathly Hallows you are in for a thrill.  Highly recommended.
