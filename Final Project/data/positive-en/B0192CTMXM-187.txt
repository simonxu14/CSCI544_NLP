I am pretty certain that more children today have read "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" than "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," and whether that's a bad thing or a good thing, I don't really have an opinion.  One distinction shared by the two books is that they've both been featured at the top of "challenged books" lists, i.e., books that people sought to have banned from libraries, though Twain a lot longer than Rowling.  I see it as a badge of honor for both authors.<br /><br />HPDH is a big, rambling book.  And what are children getting in their nearly eight hundred-page tome that concludes the seven-book Harry Potter series?  Harry explaining things as usual (or not, as the case may be) to his buddies Ron and Hermione, some considerable searching for "Horcruxes" and "hallows," and a lot of death and mayhem.  In other words, just what the kids ordered.<br /><br />Rowling shows a sure hand in this volume.  Her style feels considerably more polished than at the start of the series, and she gets the mood right, dark and foreboding.  I must say the Horcruxes and hallows threads get rather complicated though ingenious and, in the case of the hallows, even lyrical.  You know it's complicated when our hero Harry has to explain it all to arch-villain Voldemort, and yet his Lordship doesn't seem to quite get it, does he?<br /><br />Someone has said that film adaptations of adventure stories capture action better than the books on which they're based, and the original novels are superior in characterization exposition.  If true, part of the reason for this is that movies can only show so much in two-to-three hours, and books can, as in this case, just go on and on.  Also, watching things going boom is arguably a lot cooler than reading about things going boom.  However that may be, it seems to this reviewer that the movies really did excel in the action sequences and the book in delivering depth in characterization.  As the only novel in the series that is not really structured by a year at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry--this one was to have been Harry's last--HPDH depicts Harry's trials largely far away from the familiar haunts of the previous books.  When he finally does return to the school, there's almost a palpable sense that he's no longer the boy wizard.<br /><br />Despite the cinematographer's advantage, the climactic battle late in the story is well executed.  This is the only book that I read after viewing the film version, and so I am at a disadvantage in trying to be evenhanded in treating the novel.  Even so, Rowling describes the battle effectively and, at the same time, pleases her fans by uniting all the surviving characters from the novels.  Not as convincing, as mentioned above, was Potter's insistence on explaining things to Voldemort rather than simply dispatching him.  It was like one of those Bond movies where the villain sets up a Rube Goldberg death machine to dispose of the hero (allowing him to escape because it's so slow), but in reverse.  "Let me tell you where you went wrong..." is the uptake, and you want to go, "No, you idiot, kill him!"<br /><br />Reading the seven Harry Potter books aloud to my daughter has been a highlight of our lives over the past several years.  She's been absolutely delighted by the novels, and I have been thrilled to spend time reading them to her.  And so now, having performed these books, all the while trying to keep straight all the different voices of the various characters, it's sad to say goodbye.  Also, I believe I am now entitled to The Order of the Phoenix, honoring parents who read aloud all of the increasingly longer books.<br /><br />"Dad, that's not what the Order of the Phoenix is!"<br /><br />I know, I know.
