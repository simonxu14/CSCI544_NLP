My son loves this thorough Pokemon Guide! He does not even know how to really play yet (he is 7), but he loves reading about the different types of Pokemon. The illustrations are great! The pages themselves are a good thickness. It is a paperback, but not a flimsy one.The value is very good, as it was more expensive from stores.
