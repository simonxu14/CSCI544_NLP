For the Audio Book:  Great story.  I can't say anything new about the HP series.  You love them, or don't (really!?).  Anyway, the expert reading by Jim Dale makes the book even better.  Kids actually enjoyed long vacation drives so they could listen to the books.  Great investment into family tranquility.
