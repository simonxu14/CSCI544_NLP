WARNING<br />SPOILERS***<br />This is my second reading of the final chapter in the Harry Potter series, and as good as it was, it fell short of being a great book.  The character of Snape appeared to be a mere afterthought in Rowlings' writing and Snape was always one of my favorite characters.  Given his importance in all that transpired, you would think that he would get a better send-off than the one he received.  Moreover, the reasons behind all the things he did -- love for Lilly is rather simplistic.  This character came from a troubled background, and he appears to have struggled to find his place in the world for most of his life, yet his only motivating factor for doing anything is Lilly Potter?<br /><br />In the end, Rowling also raises questions about Dumbledore's character and motivations without any real exploration or resolution to the question's posed.<br /><br />As for the ultimate resolution, instead of being inventive, she sticks us with the unbelievable and pedestrian pairing of Harry and Ginny Weasley, and the "I've run out of ideas, so I'll stick them together" pairing of Hermione and Ron.  Does Ms. Rowlings seriously believe that putting these couples together speaks to creativity or ingenious?  To me it spoke to how do I wrap this up in what I think is a neat little bow writing.<br /><br />All-in-all, I would have preferred a more thoughtful examination of the characters than what we were provided.  Having said that, I still love the series as a whole, and commend Rowlings for bringing these characters to the public, and for getting kids to read.
