J.K. Rowling's fifth installment of the "Harry Potter" series does not disappoint. I was a little late jumping on the HP bandwagon (it's 2010, can't you tell?) :-) But this has been my favorite book of the series so far. The first few chapters are much more engaging in comparison to the previous books, as she jumps into action much more quickly. However, "Order of the Phoenix" is definitely a book of girth. At almost 900 pages, it takes patience. Don't judge it based on the movies -- as with any of the HP movies, they leave out a lot in comparison to the books.
