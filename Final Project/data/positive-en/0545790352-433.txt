My 10 year old daughter reads 2 grade levels behind.  But she LOVES Harry Potter movies.  I got her this and I have to say it's the most beautiful artwork I've EVER seen in a picture book.  The narrative is the same as the original books but the artistry accompanying the words helps her continue and persevere when usually she becomes overwhelmed.  My husband and I drooled over it when it arrived.  It's the prettiest book we own!
