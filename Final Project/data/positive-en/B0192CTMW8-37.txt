Fun and easy read. For kids and adults, these are magical and exciting books. My kids and I are reading the series together and my 11 year old is already on the final book and he started reading Book 1 during Christmas break!! He can't put the books down. Sometimes he chooses to read over playing on his Xbox! That's a big deal. :)
