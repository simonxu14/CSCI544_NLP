This book kept my interest until the end! I laughed, cried, and was thrilled with the vivid language! New characters jump into the picture and the good old ones stay... There are a few twists along the way too! If you haven't read any of the Harry Potter Series (all of which I reccomend) then this one fills you in on most of the facts. This is a definite must-read!
