This book is in great condition. Dust cover has minimal wear and still retains it's bright colors and shiny lettering. The spine feels like it has been loosened by no more than 2 reads. Pages are crisp, untarnished, and unmarred.<br /><br />The seller had my item shipped within 24 hours.<br /><br />On a personal note, I'm glad to have the hard copy of such a delightful book. You don't have to be a child to enjoy the series. In fact, reading them as an adult adds that extra bit of nostalgia to the experience. Even if you are not into fantasy, there are very powerful messages in this story that transcend the genre. The first three novels are very light reads and can be quite therapeutic at the end of the day.
