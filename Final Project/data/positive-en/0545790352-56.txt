This book is absolutely fantastic. I pre-ordered it months ago and was so excited to receive it yesterday! The illustrations are just fantastic. I can't wait to re-read the book for the billionth time, and I can't wait for them to release the rest of the series in illustrated form!! This is an absolute MUST HAVE for any true Harry Potter lover!! One thing to know about the product is that it is actually very large and heavy- I wasn't expecting it to be so big. Nothing that takes away from the product- in fact, it makes the pictures even better to look at!
