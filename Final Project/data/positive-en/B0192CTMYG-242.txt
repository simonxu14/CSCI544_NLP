The Harry potter books are great for any age!! I flew threw all the books within a month and I so wish there were more to read!! Very interesting and keeps you wanting to know what's going to happen next!! Now after years ago I read I am now introducing the books to my nieces and nephews!! :) they are very intrigued too!!
