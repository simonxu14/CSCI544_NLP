Wow, this book really makes up for any slowness in the other ones. It is fast paced with plenty of action. JK wraps up the plot very neatly, despite the body count. I wish she did more of a background story on voldemore. Why exactly did he become evil? But other then that the book helps explain many mysteries that were unexplained. Dont look to me for an answer, go pick it up and read it!
