This book has been a great addition to my son'e Pokemon collection.  We have read about Pokemon every night since he received the book. The colors are really bright and eye catching. The information about each Pokemon is interesting for the enthusiast.  It tells about all of their moves and shows the evolution of each Pokemon. It is sorted alphabetically which is helpful as long as you know the Pokemon's name. I knocked it one star as I wish it was color coded or something so you could easily see which type the Pokemon are (i.e. water type, grass type, electric type etc.)
