I'm going to preface this by saying the HP1 is my least favorite book.<br /><br />However, with that being said, the illustrations definitely helped improve the story and made me enjoy it more than I did in 1999/2000 when I first read it. If there isn't a full-page or full-spread illustration, the actual text is written on what looks like parchment paper with ink stains and wrinkles, which is awesome. The illustrations of characters are reflective of the text descriptions by J.K.R. and not what we want them to be based on movies or other illustrations.<br /><br />Overall, I'm really excited with this new approach to this Harry Potter reprinting route, and that it's not just changing the cover image and binding.
