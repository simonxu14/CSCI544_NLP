My wife and I just started reading these books this past year. We've read all four out loud to each other and love them. This book is definitely setting the stage for the next three. I can't wait to see where Rowling takes it!<br />We're both Christians who take our faith very seriously. The whole &quot;witch&quot; thing did slow us down from reading these books but now that we are--we love them! It's funny, witches and warlocks in the writings of Tolkein or C.S. Lewis never bothered me. I'm not sure why they did here. I'm glad I got over it! Rowlings books are definitely worth reading.
