I have a hard time believing I only spend $24 on this book. It is simply stunning. I was excited but hesitant to see someone else's interpretation of the Harry Potter world but it is gorgeous. It is a must have for any HP fan. I have six other print editions with varying covers and this is by far the most gorgeous. It is a little hard to read because it is such a large book, but so so worth it. Can't wait for the next six! I feel like a kid again waiting for the next book to be released!!!
