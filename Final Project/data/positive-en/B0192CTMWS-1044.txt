I seriously think this is the best of the series.  Rowling takes us from one thing to another very gracefully.  A lot of things happen and the plot thickens many times, but I think it flows better than book 4.  Many funny things happen making me wonder how people can call this the darkest of all the HP series. I think #4 was darker with the weird death eaters. Rowling does a great job of expanding the existing characters and other "creatures" from the previous books. This is good against evil, coming if age, mystery all wrapped up in one great book.
