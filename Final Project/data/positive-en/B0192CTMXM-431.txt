I really wasn't expecting the ending to be what it is...the way the book is written really led me to believe in certain other events to occur.  Overall, it was a great surprise and a great ending to the series.  The only disappointment was there are a few obvious unanswered questions such as what happens to certain characters, what do they eventually do in the future, etc.
