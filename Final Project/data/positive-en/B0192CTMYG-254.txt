This is a great book for kids. It's pretend, made up, so don't let anyone scare you off. It's not any different from The Hobbit in scariness. The only thing Rowling did differently was not proclaim that she was Christian. If she had the Christians would look at this differently and make comparisons to Biblical stories.
