This book was simply amazing.  The hardcover is a little over nine-hundred pages.  I received it on Saturday, started reading it on Sunday and was finished with it by Wednesday, four days!  I couldn't put it down, my heart was in my throat every other chapter!  If I had not had to work all day during the week, I beleive I would have finished it in two!  Unfortunately I have to wait another few years for the next book!  But I would never wish to rush JK Rowling's writing of the next story, the detail, and magic that she puts into every one of her pages makes the wait worth while.  This book and every one of her other's are excellent reads that are highly enjoyable whether adult or child.
