I loved the new harry potter book.Yet another masterpiece by J.K. Rowling.It was just as exciting and imaginative as the other three.I enjoyed every moment. I really missed not having quidditch matches. They  added a lot of excitment and adrenaline. But, the other new addition the  triwizard cup was cool. in this three (4 in this case because harry  potter's name is put in my the bad guy hopimg he'd die)wizards from three  different wizarding schools compete for 1,000 galleons(dollars in  muggle)and school pride.  Warning for younger readers and parents: This  book is much more intense than the first three. Its a little bit creepier,  a little bit gorier, and a hogwarts student dies. (ending warning) My one  complaint in that was most of the book was explaing and less action, unlike  the other three harry potter books. Hey, that is my only complaint. In  conclusion: I loved this one. But, it wasn't as good as the third one which  is my favorite.
