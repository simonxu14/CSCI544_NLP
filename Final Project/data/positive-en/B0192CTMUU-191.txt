This product would receive a full 5-star rating - Jim Dale is an extremely gifted reader and brings J.K. Rowling's engaging stories to life in a way different from either the written word or the blockbuster movies - except that, in the series of around 20 CDs, there are a few CDs that skip and/or stick.<br /><br />I suppose in the world of high-speed mass production, this is bound to happen occasionally.  And I imagine that CDs are still better than cassettes as they rarely get caught in a player, unlike tapes that wear and stretch.  Still, when you're sailing along, listening to a wonderfully executed performance and you are suddenly dropped back into the world of faulty technology, it's a little off-putting.<br /><br />POINT OF CURIOSITY: Between recording Book 4 and Book 5, Mr. Dale changed his pronounciation of "VOLDEMORT."  In Book 4, He Who Must Not Be Named's name rhymes with "Baltimore," but in Book 5 (and beyond) we hear the final "t" pronounced quite clearly.
