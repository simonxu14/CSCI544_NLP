We need to add a star to the usual scale, because five isn't enough!  For the last four books, the praise of Rowling's writing has always been followed by remarks about it being a light, sweet story about nothing that goes easy on the brain.  That is over now in a big way. Harry has grown up quite a bit over the summer.  He has the temper of a teenage boy; he no longer holds the (good) adults in his life in owe; he has developed a sense of his own abilities, but has not let that make him arrogant, as everyone expected.  He has grown. However, the things he goes through in The Order of the Phoenix FORCE him to grow up even more before you.  So much so, that I had to shut my eyes and walk away from the book to catch a few breaths, muttering to myself that this was enough, more than enough already... hoping it would stop, because how much can a 15-year-old boy be expected to carry on his shoulders?!  Neither is his world any longer circumscribed by the walls of Hogwarts.<br />I was completely blown away by Rowling's inventiveness and her astounding ability to capture the spirits of the characters and their world in vivid, breathing color.  The last four books were wonderful, yes - but this one is in a class of it own.
