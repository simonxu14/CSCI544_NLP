That this series didn't have to come to an end.  And it doesn't, Ms. Rowling!!<br /><br />This was one of the better books in the series.  She worked with an editor who encouraged her to stop using so many -ly adverbs (angrily, hautily, etc.), and the writing's improved because of it.<br /><br />I've read where others complained that Hermoine and Ginny threw themselves at Ron and Harry.  Balderdash.  These characters are now 17 years old, not 11.  Hormones are natural with teenagers, whether those teenagers are wizards or muggles.  Rowling acknowledges that.  Also, others complained about Ron's book which provides insight into girls.  How is that different than reading Cosmo or any of those other magazines?  And still others complained about the profanity.  There isn't that much in a 700+ page book.  Finally, one reviewer stated that she took this book away from her nine year old child.  Excuse me, who would let a nine year old try to read this book?  Probably the same kind of parent who takes a nine year old to an "R" rated movie and then complains about the violence and language.  Sigh...<br /><br />Yes, "Hallows" was a dark book.  But when you have an epic battle between good and evil, things will be dark (Stephen King's "The Stand," for example).  And, as Harry phrases it, "This is war!"  In every war, there are casualities and collateral damage.<br /><br />Jo Rowling does a great job of bringing the saga full circle.  We see characters we haven't seen since the beginning.  Wizards, giants, goblins, house-elves, other magicals, and muggles populate this book.  The book did sag in the middle when our trio searched for the Horcruxes.  That part was about 200-300 pages too long.  It picked up again when they made their way to Hogwarts.  But remember, this is an epic.  And any epic worth its salt will be on the long side.<br /><br />As the story ends, there is an epilogue that takes place 19 years later.  If Jo Rowling wants to stop writing, that's her choice.  I wish she'd allow other writers to pick up this tale and fill in those missing years.  I think people would have great fun with it.  She once blasted fan fiction writers who wrote their own tales as a way to deal with the angst of waiting for her to finish these books.  There is nothing wrong with fan fiction.  Other writers would enjoy filling in that 19 year period, and we could have even more Harry Potter-related stories.  Hey, it worked for Star Wars and Star Trek and James Bond; why not Harry Potter??<br /><br />You'll enjoy this book if you've enjoyed the series.  And to those who complain??  You remind me of a person who'd complain if he got a  million dollars that he'd have to pay taxes on it.  Take some deep breaths, relax, and eat a Chocolate Frog.
