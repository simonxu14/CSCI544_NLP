This book is beautifully illustrated and is a great way to introduce kids to the Harry Potter saga. Personally I find the Harry Potter stories a little too scary for younger kids. I would guess this would suit kids 10-12, this being said I heard some kids at my daughter's school age 7 discussing Harry Potter this am - so some kids love the series despite the horror aspects. I am more keen on the fantasy aspects of Potter's world - the amazing school, wizardry, cool characters etc. I think the book would be a nice addition to anyone's library - old and young alike.
