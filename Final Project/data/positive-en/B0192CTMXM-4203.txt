Normally, even with a book I like, I do a little mental rewriting. In this case,  didn't feel the need to rewrite anything.<br /><br />There is a lot of death in this book, and I thought it would be a good idea to have a 'children's version' with lighter content... but after thinking it over...<br /><br />The story had a war in it. There's a war going on right now. Plenty of kids have parents in the war or know someone who has parents and loved ones fighting, losing limbs, or dying. This is just a book and it might make them sad but it might help them deal with real sadness.<br /><br />Life is full of good and bad... and for both, children need guidance. Letting them run mad with the good while hiding the bad leaves them poorly prepared to deal with whatever life deals them in the future.<br /><br />ACK, how did I get on this soapbox! *leaps off* Ahem... yes... I liked the book... and it did make me cry but in the end, I was pleased.
