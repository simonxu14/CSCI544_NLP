I did not read this but my 16 and 14 year olds devoured it and loved this book.  They couldn't put it down.  We gave it to our 17 year old nephew and he too finished it in record time.  Our 20 year old college student also throughly enjoyed this book.  They did not want to finish it because it was the last one.
