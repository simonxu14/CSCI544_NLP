My children and I arrived to get our reserved copy of Harry Potter right at 11:30 p.m.  By the time I got home and settled into a good read, it was 2:00.  My poor husband woke up to go to work at 7:00 to see me wiping my eyes and closing the backcover.  Not wanting to spoil it for him, I could only say...it didn't last near long enough.<br /><br />What a wonderfully complex book!  There was one section where Harry is so focused on retrieving items (not saying what!) that seemed forced and thrown in there at the last minute.  It just did not feel fleshed out.  Overall, however, the book was paced (not too fast, not too slow) and seemed to give the many characters a chance to shine each.  I sniffled over every death and wanted them not to have occured but it is a war and that is what happens in a war.<br /><br />About the end...all I will say is I want more details!  For those of you who have no idea what I mean...READ THE BOOK!  *G*  Enjoy!
