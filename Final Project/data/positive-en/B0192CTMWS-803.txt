I got it Saturday morning and finished it by 7pm Sunday.  So of course on the good side, I had trouble putting the book down and am sorely wanting the sixth book already.  Throughtout the book (based on the other books) I sensed that one character would meet an untimely demise, but it was in fact a different character with whom all readers will likely find a stronger attachment to meet their end.  Rowling did an excellent job of evoking emotions at that moment and I had to re-read the entire chapter to get a feel for all of the events of the scene.  Overall there was some good plot and character develoment.  Much of the quality of the series has to do with character flaws of the  people in the book, especially harry, making the whole experience more easy to relate to, despite the fantasy setting.  Overall the series has not shown a sign of let down that other series of long length have done and I heartily endorse this volume as a good follow-up story for the Potter series.
