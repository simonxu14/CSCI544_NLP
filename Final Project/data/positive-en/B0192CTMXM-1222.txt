Deathly Hallows is the climax and closing to the 7 book Harry Potter series. It's urgent pacing will leave readers enthralled and utterly spent until the last chapter where readers may finally catch their breath.<br /><br />I would also suggest HP enthusiasts acquiring the unabridged audio books reads by Jim Dale. He brings the characters to life and color to your imagination.
