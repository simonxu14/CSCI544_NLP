That I am just now reading the Harry Potter series would surprise no one who knows me. I'm usually a good 3-5 years behind trend. Harry Potter has legions of adoring fans and noted detractors, who are in turn drowned out by the passion of Harry Potter fans. I understood nothing of HP before I read my first book, which was ironically book three: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. After reading the first book I'm now proud to say that I am a fan, maybe not to the extent that some people are, since I've largely missed being on the ten year journey of most Potter fans. I'm also living proof that you can still get something out of the books, even if the wave has driven past you.<br /><br />What impressed me is that J.K. Rowling didn't fall into the trap of many authors of young adult literature by creating these clich&eacute; stock characters that appear built out of cardboard. Furthermore, every detail of the world of Harry Potter feels as though it was meticulously crafted by a painter or a sculptor rather than an author--true talent indeed. Even seemingly minor characters are intimately fleshed out. I think its' these two factors that give Harry Potter its' unique place in contemporary literature. I decline to provide a plot summary, because so many reviewers have done those already, and plus Harry Potter is really about an experience that goes deeper than a book.
