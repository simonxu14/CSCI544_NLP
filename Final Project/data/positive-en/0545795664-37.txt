If you have a child/children who is playing the Pokemon Go, then this book is for them.  I would definitely recommend it as my kids take them book when they go Pokemon hunting which is done on the weekend after their homework is done.  It is very detail with the Pokemon characters and their individual history, it also gives you the evolve version of each Pokemon.
