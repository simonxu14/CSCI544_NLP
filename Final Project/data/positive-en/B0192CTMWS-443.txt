Be sure to brush up on the last two Harry Potter books or you'll be guessing about what's going on with some of the story line.  Over all it was worth waiting for; thanks to Amazon I didn't stand in a long line or pay $35+; a friend of mine did!.  Pre-orders are great, just picked the book up at the Post Office on the day it was released.
