The Goblet of Fire arrived 2:01 pm Saturday.  My son was halfway done by bedtime.  Out-of-town guests arrived 7 am Sunday.  5 out of 7 people in the house read the entire book by the following Sunday.  (My deranged husband  is into Abe Lincoln, and the 5 yr old can't read yet.) The house is  littered with bookmarks.  On a serious note, if your children are younger  than 10, you may want to screen this book and #5-7 of the series before you  let them read it.  It does look like things are getting darker.  Injuries  and deaths to main characters can be very upsetting. Also, although some  people may like all the reminders, my son and I have read all the books at  least 3 times, and we'd rather have a little less repetition.  Just read  the books in order.
