This book was purchased for my nephew.  He read it in two days, and then he reread it.  I have only watched the movies; however, he says the book is much better, because the are no details left out.  If you are a HARRY POTTER FAN, YOU HAVE FOUND A GREAT BOOK TO READ.  YOUNGER AND OLDER FOLKS WILL ENJOY THIS BOOK.
