It is amazing, after reading the 4 previous books, that "The Order of the Phoenix" is even better then I imagined. From the 1st chapter you are off and running into this exciting book that you can hardly put down.  I admit I was getting impatient over the last three years for this book's release - but it was well worth the wait and more!  The intricacies woven through this book and yet still woven into from the previous 4 books is astonishing.  J. K. Rowling has an amazing imagination, which I hope she continues to use to write books even beyong the 7 book series of Harry Potter.  I know I will, personally, being waiting anxiously for the next 2 books and yet I don't want to see the end of the Harry Potter serier. I wish they could just keep going on and on and on....
