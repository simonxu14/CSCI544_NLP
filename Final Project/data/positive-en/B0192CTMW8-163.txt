I am a 10 year old boy who read the Sorceror's Stone and the Chamber of Secrets.  I am currently reading The Prisoner of Azkaban.  I think both books were really fantastic!  My mom started reading them to me, but she  was too slow so I read them myself.  They were so good that I finished them  in just 3 weeks.  The thing I liked most about the books was the adventures  that Harry had.  They are so good, I think all kids should read them.  Josh  in Tilden, Tx.
