I got this book for my niece so that the first time she read harry potter, it could be with pictures.  And the pictures did not let down, not only were the pages of high quality, but the images were amazing.  They were realistic, but just odd enough to feel like a child's imagination... they felt so right for the book and I couldn't be more impressed.  Very glad I got this book, and the price is great too!
