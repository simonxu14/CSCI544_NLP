I own the entire set of the Harry Potter unabridged audio CDs and have listened to the earlier books many times over.  I have always been impressed with the way that Jim Dale keeps all of the voices for the characters straight from book to book.<br />He finally slips up in this one though.  For some odd reason, he has Dean Thomas and Lee Jordan speaking with an Irish accent.  I know it's a little thing, but it just hits my ear wrong.<br />Other than that, a fine job reading a wonderful book.
