loved the book<br />still managed to capture all the essence of JKR previous books of charm and magical mystery even though we know it is the last book.  i think we partly live in hope that it could offer us a world like Tolkien left.  that she could be able to write a book or two a bout his fathers time in school or about the seedy pasts of voldemort before he became who he was.. alas i doubt that will happen but it can always be a dream
