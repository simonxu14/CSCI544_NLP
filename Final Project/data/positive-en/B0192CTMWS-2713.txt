(This is a spoiler-free review)<br /><br />I feel lucky to have started this series so late in the game, and so lucky to have gotten into it just in time to enjoy the final release of this title, along with the rest of Potter fans around the globe. Respect must go to Amazon, for getting it to people's doorsteps on release day, and with the treat of some special packaging that really made the occasion all the more special.<br /><br />What more can be said about this book other than it's a very sad thing to see the series end, yet very necessary. We've seen many things with this group of characters, and Rowling's universe--like our own--is filled with people who have courage, good, evil and a little bit of everything inside them in a way that pulls us all in.<br /><br />This book is a very satisfying read, an obviously a must-own title for anyone who likes to read books that take you on an adventure. Like The Davinci Code, and other page turners, The Deathly Hallows is hard to put down--and with good reason: this is the end. My only disappointment is that this book (despite its size) feels too short in its ending. Not to say the story is not finished in a satisfying manner (because it is), but rather that we can't once again delve into Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, or any of the other fantastic places that have become so clearly etched in our minds, and don't get some additional exposition that might have made it even more satisfying.<br /><br />That being said, everyone has their own opinion about a book, and I think most will agree that this is simply a masterpiece. Thanks for all the pages J.K. Rowling, and for a story that will be passed down with other classics.
