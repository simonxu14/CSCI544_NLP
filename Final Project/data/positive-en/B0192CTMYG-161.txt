I'm a late comer to the Harry Potter mania.  I wasn't even interested in reading the books or watching the movies until I got a free blu-ray copy of the Deathly Hallows with my new blu-ray player.  I watched part 1 and 2 and then I rushed out to the store to buy the first two movies.  I had to see how it all started.  After viewing all of them I wanted to read the books.  I had found that the U.S. (Scholastic) version was slightly different from the original UK version by Bloomsbury.  It seems the US publishers felt we would understand the British slang.  Anyway, I wanted the UK version and purchased this edition. I didn't have any problems with the British text. The jacket is very nice with a beautiful picture of the Philosopher's stone on the front and a picture of J.K. Rowlings on the back.  The book itself is nicely bound in black.  There are no pictures on the book itself, only gold lettering on the spine.  There are also no illustrations inside the book either since it is the &#34;adult version,&#34; I suppose.  The papers are a soft parchment color instead of bright white and is of nice quality.<br />  Of course the book was fun and it really draws you into the Harry's newly discovered wizard world, and into Harry's life.  I have enjoyed getting to know the other characters as well. Much of the text is word for word the script of the movie.  I'm not sure if the first edition was this close since I haven't read it, but I would like to.  I also understand that this (2004) edition corrected some mistakes that were in the original text.  There is a whole website devoted to the books that explains the differences page by page.<br />At 223 pages, it is a quick read and one I will probably reach for many times over the years.  Thank you J.K. Rowling for sharing your vision.
