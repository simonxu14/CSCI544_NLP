This is the first in a series of seven books.  It's a great start and a wonderful way to introduce the characters, the setting, and the conflict.  The next books in the series are better in that they start to more fully develop the characters, intensify the danger, and darken the conflict. I have read this book many, many times, including reading it in other languages, and I am well into my 30's. It's a nice way to lose yourself for a few hours into a fantasy world that you can just almost believe is real.
