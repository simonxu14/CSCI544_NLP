This series has been very good. Some books may have started out slower than others but they always picked up. Deathly Hollows grabbed me from almost the very beginning. Excellent book and a great ending to an awesome series. It's a little sad to say by to Harry and Friends, but it is going out with a Bang and not a whimper. Big book but an easy read once started. My children and I have all become big fans.
