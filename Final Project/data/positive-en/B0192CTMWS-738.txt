The latest Potter novel continues the magical story of a boy growing up in a society of witches and wizards.  The biggest complaint that I have is that it is too long, if that is possible.  At 870 pages the weight of the book makes it hard to hold up while reading.  And while all of the sidebar adventures were interesting it kind of dragged in the middle.  The main plot elements of Harry's conflict with the Dark Lord was not advanced very far.  The scene near the end with the magical combat between Dumbledore's Army and the Death Eaters went on too long.  I got the impression that she is writing that scene more as a movie script than for a novel.  On the positive side Rowling doesn't shy away from inclusion of dark aspects in her "children's" books.  One of Harry's friends dies (or does he?).  Characters are rarely all good or all bad.  Fudge from the Ministry of Magic is a villain despite being in charge of protecting people, perhaps an education for teenage readers about how real governments are so often wrong about most everything.  I hope she cuts the next one down a little.  My arms got tired.
