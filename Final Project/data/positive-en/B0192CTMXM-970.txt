This book was an enjoyable experience to read. I was rather impressed at how well written the details were given of characters and places as well as the tie in of events that occurred not only in this book though in the previous books leading to this one. I am not a big reader and have not read the other books and may just go back and do so. With this book I had known everything that was going to happen in the book before it was released, due to online leaks. However I knew it would not keep me from enjoying the book, which I enjoyed far greater because even though I knew what would happen, how it happened was truly the adventure and surprising it was. Very well done.
