I cannot believe this book. The fifth installment in the Harry Potter series certianly contains its fair share of action, adventure, intrigue, humor, and surprises.<br />I would be hesistant to say that this is the best of the series, but it is delightful and the ending is crammed full of interesting tidbits. I was incredibly sad over the death of one of the characters, but I understand why that particular character was chosen.<br />I did appreciate how JK Rowling has attempted to prove the characters are growing up, the jealousy, anger, frustration, and romance displayed in the book are fair representations of the emotions found in a teenagers life, just modified with witchcraft and wizardry. I did not appreciate Harry's many temper tantrums, but then again, it's not my book.<br />It was also nice to see some new characters, as well as bringing Firenze back, he is such a cool centaur. oooo, that lady though, Professor Umbridge, she was a piece of work!!! i wouldn't like to have to serve a detention with that individual!<br />I was very pleased with the book overall and I am very much looking forward to the next book in the series!!
