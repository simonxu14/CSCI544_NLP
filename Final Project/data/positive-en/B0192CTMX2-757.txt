While I felt all along that Harry was a bit too chipper through<br />his previous trials in books 1-4, I hardly expected the whining<br />and temper tantrums in The Order of the Phoenix. Maybe things<br />happen later in Britain, but the teenagers I teach go through this at 12 and 13. Ditto the angst and awkwardness with his new girlfriend. I found the book very dark and frustrating without some of the comic relief I've come to expect from Rowling. I suspected as I read along that the entire 800+ pages was such a huge machine grinding along to set up books 6 and 7 that I wondered how it would stand alone as a work of fiction.<br />There were many enjoyable moments and some nice payoff in the deepening friendship among the three main characters. We get a glimpse into a few of the more minor characters and a large question mark around a family member. I wasn't surprised at the identity of the character who died. Rowling also leaves the fate<br />of at least one villain dangling in a very tantalizing way.<br />I hope the next two books give us  magic, mystery and plot resolution!
