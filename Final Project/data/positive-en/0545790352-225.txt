I am blown away with the quality of the book. I have seem pictures of it, but I was still surprised by the size, once it arrived. All the illustrations are gorgeous and the paper and print quality are great! I would recommend this Harry Potter edition to everyone! :)<br /><br />On a side note, if you are ordering internationally, be aware of how your border customs treat the packages. On our customs, they basically butchered the Amazon box and even the air bags that were supposed to keep the book secure. Luckily, the book arrived unharmed and pristine though!
