I was aware of some of the controversy surrounding this series and so decided to read it to my children myself, rather then letting my 8 and 10 year old read it alone.  I am very glad I did.  The story is captivatng from the start, and we all enjoyed it thouroughly.<br />We took plenty of pauses and breaks to let the storyline sink in, stopping to discuss what was happening and why, and what we thought might happen next.  My kids loved the challenge, and I liked watching them mentally engaged,their minds working.  No one was bored. The storyline is fairly complex, with many characters and subplots.<br />I strongly suggest this book be read as a family.  We can't wait to start the next.
