This has been one of my favorite books my whole life. My grandparents in England gave me &#34;Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone&#34; when I was about 7 years old, and I have been a fan of the Harry Potter series ever since. It brings me great joy for the colorful world of Harry Potter to be brought to life in this colorful, illustrated edition. I was impressed with the quality of the illustrations, the binding, and the overall look and feel of this book.
