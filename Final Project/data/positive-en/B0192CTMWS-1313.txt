Well Im 68 years old and have enjoyed all seven Potter books.<br /><br />I hate to see the series end but all good things will end in time.<br /><br />I enjoyed #7 and it's surprise ending.<br /><br />This one is the most violent of the series so I would suggest parent review before letting the younger ones read it.
