The last Harry Potter, and, arguably, the best novel.  Harry has reached maturity and must now face his fate- will he be able to find all of Voldemort's Horcruxes?  Will he be able to survive the ultimate fight?<br /><br />It was with a mixture of sadness and glee that I read this novel.  Over the series, I felt close to the characters and wasn't ready to say goodbye.  However, by the end of the novel I felt complete.  I felt as if everything that was supposed to happen did happen.  This is one of my all time favorite novels.
