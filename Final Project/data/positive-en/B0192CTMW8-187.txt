I was introduced to the Harry Potter books by my 9 1/2 year old son and I didn't really know what to expect...  I was very plreasantly surprised when I loved all 3 of them!  I had a to giggle at a negative review of  &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot; that was written by a 16 year old; she/he  spent more time slamming anyone who enjoys the books than actually writing  about the book itself and I got the feeling that she/he wanted to hear  her/himself go on and on.  She/he also said that the only reason that these  books are popular is because of media hype, but my intorduciton to the  books shoots down that theory.  &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot; picks up where  &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; left off and I found myself instantly swept  away with Harry and the gang.  Rowling uses tidbits from the first book and  I also know, from having read the third installment, that she will continue  to weave the web further as more about Harry' s past and future is  revealed.  It's fun to hate the Dursleys, Snape and the Malfoys and it's a  kick to love the charming Weasleys and the kindly, but strict teachers at  the wizard school.  And I love Harry, Ron and Hermione because they  continue to be typical kids, albeit kids who happen to be magic.  Rowling's  desciptions are very vivid, her characters are very well fleshed out and  the story is extrememly compelling.  I'd recommend this book to kids above  7 or 8 (depending on their reading level) and to all adults who enjoy being  swept away by a book that has a wry sense of humor and an engaging plot.
