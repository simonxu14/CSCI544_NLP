I don't want to put any spoilers into this review. I will simply say that I read this book in 2 days when it first arrived, I couldn't put it down. I work full time and also go to grad school, so I don't have a lot of free time, but this book was so good that I found the time to read it over and over. The only suggestions I can share are to be ready for non-stop action from the get-go, that is what makes this book so much harder to put down than most HP books (not an easy task to begin with). The epilogue may frustrate you, so you have been warned if you choose to read it. Other than that, this book is amazing and full of emotion. A fitting end to an amazing series.
