I think Rowling did a very good job on this book. She tied up all the loose ends, well at least the ones I was worried about the most. I like how she did the afterlife. I thought her interpretation to be both unique and familiar at the same time. There a were a few scenes were I think she stretched a little too far to bring it all together but what do I know?<br /><br />If you have read the series up to now I'm sure you will want to read this one. Whether she says so or not I see there being room here for more books.
