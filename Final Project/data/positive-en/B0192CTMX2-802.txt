Many have questioned J.K. Rowling's ability to keep as tight a hold on her captivated audience as she has in the past few years, but those Rita Skeeter-esque people needn't have bothered wasting their quills.  The fifth book in the Harry Potter series made me scream, cry, laugh, and every other emotion that I should certainly not have expressed while I was at work.  But I couldn't help it, I finished the book in less then a day (the last three hundred pages or so, the most crucial of course, I read at work - a big, big, BIG mistake), and never have I finished a book wanting more.<br />I won't bother with a book description (read the book!), it just spoils the first reading, but I am just going to say that the mounting pressure of excitement, danger, and fear of the last four books almost explodes in this forcefully entrancing, beautifully written, well-versed, and utterly challenging book - but leaves you with only one thought at the end - when does the sixth book come out?
