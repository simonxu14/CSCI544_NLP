This hooked me on unabridged books on CD..... I have listened to it several times and I still don't get bored with it.  I have leant it out to many friends and there kids... and got themn hooked on it.  I like to listen to books on tape in my vehichle when I take trips or to and from work and like me, my friends teased they didn't want to turn the car off and couldn't wait to get back into the car to see what happened. Absolutely love the person who reads the book for you, best ever!!!!
