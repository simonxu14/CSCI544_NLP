I am 24 years old and I have just recently discovered the Harry Potter series. I grew up in a conservative household and Harry Potter was banned when I was a child. Now that I am an adult my beliefs are much more liberal than that of my family. I heard one of my friends (who is almost 20 years my senior) talking about how much she likes the Harry Potter series, so I decided to rent the Sorcerer's Stone movie. I liked it so much that I immediately ordered the book. I started reading it and found that it was really hard to put it down. I finished it this morning and I love the book. The story really draws you in. I found myself really empathizing with Harry and always wanting to find out what would happen next. I liked it so much that I ordered the second book. Thankfully it should be here tomorrow, because I cannot wait to "visit" Hogwarts again!<br /><br />To those who believe that Harry Potter is "Satanic": There is nothing satanic or evil about this book. I urge you to read the books and watch the movies before you judge them.
