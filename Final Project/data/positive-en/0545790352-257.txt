I have no words to describe the fantastic nature of this book. As a bona fide Potter Head, when I found out about this book, my inner geek went wild. A ILLUSTRATED edition? Be still my heart. Then I was convinced that no artist could do justice to the HP world. After that, I thought it was just going to be a bunch of drawings of the movie stuff. Was I ever wrong and I am so glad! The illustrations are beyond beautiful and so much closer to what I imagine Hogwarts and the characters to be than in the movies. The fantastical quality to every picture, along with the realistic aspects, lifted my imagination back to the very first time I read HP as a teen. No matter how many times I flip through, I notice something new. Jim Kay, you are amazing! I cannot wait to purchase every single book as they are released.
