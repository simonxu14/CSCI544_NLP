I am one of those people who have to read the end first to find out what happens to Harry, but I won't spoil it.  Even having done that, the book was a joy to read; all the little threads of stories coming together in a tightly knitted piece.  Ms. Rowling's ability to write has grown over the years and there are passages that I reread just for the sheer joy of her use of the language.  Well done, Ms. Rowling.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-Book-7/dp/0545010225/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Book 7)</a>
