This book is beautiful in every way, since you can open perceive the effort imposed do a book like this , no collector or  Harry Potter fan can missed, it is truly a piece of art .<br /><br />Some details :<br />1. The book is written in British English, only the title changed to the American version.<br />2. All pages have an image , to the white containing only letters are like parchment or ink stains .<br />3. I read in a review that the illustrations make further reference to the Dursleys that the Weasleys , but I think this is because is the first book, the Weasley's have much more weight in the following books to offset the illustrations.<br />4. The book is huge, a little uncomfortable to read, but once you arrange it with him everything is perfect
