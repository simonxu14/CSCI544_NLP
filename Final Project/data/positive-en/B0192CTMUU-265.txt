Die hard fans of Harry Potter as well as newcomers to the world of Hogwarts and Muggles will find this book equalling charming and amazing.  It's incredible anytime when you have ten year olds gobbling a  700+ page  book up like kids as if it were a short story.  Rowling's writing has only  gotten better: her storyline has just enough background so that even if you  have not read the other books, you can enjoy this one.  Wonderful, I would  highly reccomend it to anyone who has any &quot;reserves&quot; about it.  Become part of the Harry Potter phenomona. :)
