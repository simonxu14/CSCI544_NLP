Well, J.K. Rowling has done it again. Despite all the wonder about how the Harry Potter series would end, she delivers a powerful, appropriate, and brillant finale in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.<br /><br />Of course I like all HP fans am sad to see the series end, but it's time to start reading them all over again as our family will for years to come..
