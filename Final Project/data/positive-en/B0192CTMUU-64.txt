I absolutely loved it, the whole Harry Potter series is amazing! Always full of twists and surprises, it never lets the reader be bored for more than a second. The book is filled with specific details and creates a movie-like effect in my mind, even though I've seen the movies ðŸ˜‰. I would definitely reread it a hundred times! It's obviously one of the best books I've read, hats off to J.K. Rowling for writing such an amazingly wonderful series.
