The way that I work reviews of something that has been out for a very long time is that I basically give my opinion on it and if I like it or not. Because let's face it, when you have hundreds of other reviews you can easily get the information that you need from earlier reviews especially when it comes to something like a book that does not necessarily change unless the author decides to completely rewrite the book and that is not the case here.<br /><br />The reason I purchased this book, West try and get myself interested in reading again. I lost my interest in reading after grad school because I was averaging 50 books a semester I do believe. I chose Harry Potter because I have seen all of the movies but I have not read one of the books.  For me this is the beginning of getting back on track with reading, since I already know the movie and the plot behind it I am hoping that this will spark an interest for further reading for myself.<br /><br />So with that being said, if you are an adult having a hard time getting your reading groove back, maybe step back and read a book that may not be something that is your normal. Maybe read a book that your teenager has to read for high school or maybe even re-read a book that you read in high school and see if that sparks the interest of wanting to read.<br /><br />For now I have chose paperback, but eventually I want to get the whole set and hardcover because I do value actually having a book in my hands rather than reading a book on a screen.<br /><br />Harry Potter is a good place for me to start because there are so many adventures with in the series and the characters I will up seeing them grow on screen so I cannot wait to see how they grow with in the books and what may have been left out of the movies that when I'm reading I can go oh gosh where was that at? And I cannot wait for the new book to come out.<br /><br />Long and short my review is that a book like Harry Potter, you have to read with an open mind. I know sorcery and witchcraft will be a sore spot for some but reading ANY book with an open mind is encouraged. It opens our world to new things and more imagination. A chance to escape life through a book once in awhile is a good thing.<br /><br />And if you're wondering if this book restart my reading drought, it did help because the author has a wonderful way of putting us in a world that we went and think possible and if you pay close attention as the old saying goes there's always a moral to the story. I definitely will be buying the rest of the series to read.<br /><br /> I ask that before you give me a not helpful vote, to consider what I said in the beginning of my review which is that with all of the other reviews that are on here would you really want to read another review listing the characters, the premise of the plot, and basically give away the storyline if you have never read this book? My review is solely based on my opinion about why it is important to read even if it is an adult reading A book to motivate them to read other books in the future and to be open-minded about what ever you read. Leave me a comment let me know what I need to improve on because it's hard to leave a review on something that you've seen the movie you've read the book and you know there are hundreds of reviews that all read the same way. Thank you
