Beautiful Book!<br />- Oversized book just like the 1st of the illustrated series. (in-between the size of a coffee table book and a regular hard cover book)<br />- Illustrations are beautiful and the color pops off of the pages!<br />- High quality thick paper that you would expect from a book of this price range and size.<br /><br />Great for any Harry Potter fan, collector, or even as a gift!
