I have never been bitten by the whole Harry Potter "bug", but my 11 year old son, in anticipation of the latest (last?) book, sat and re-read all the other ones that came before.  He said it made the waiting easier.  I can't begin to understand that, but oh well.<br />I ended up ordering two copies because my 24 year-old daughter who was going to be in a wedding the weekend the book was released wanted her own copy to read between the rehearsal and the wedding. She then planned to skip out of the reception early so no one would be able to ruin the ending for her!!!!  Now that's dedication!  It was gratifying to see my son (11), my daughter (24) and one of my other daughters (17) who bought her own copy, sit there and discuss in very minute detail, the substance of all the books. But their collective enthusiasm is still not enough to get me to start reading the Potter series.  It's just not my genre of choice.
