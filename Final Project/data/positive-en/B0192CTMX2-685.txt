When I sat down with my much anticipated copy of OoP I was a little worried that it might not live up to all of my expectations.  In the previous books Rowling creates characters that are 'real' to readers and her use of language allows one to create a clear mental picute of the action.  Much to my relief this was also true in this book.<br />  One of the things that I like best about this series is that the author allows her characters to 'grow up'.  By not keeping Harry 11 years old forever Rowling gives readers the oppertunity to get to know him anew with every book.<br />  In this book Harry is angry (as many pre-publication interviews have stated) but it is well done and is no more than one would expect from a 15 year old.<br />  some important things to consider before reading this book<br />-you must have read the previous books in order to enjoy this one<br />-there are several things going on at once so and it may be difficult for younger readers to keep them straight<br />-it is not an 'easy read' for younger readers so they will need help with this one either by reading with them or by getting the audio version so they can listen as they read<br />-as for parents who are worried about Harry liking girls do not worry it is no big deal
