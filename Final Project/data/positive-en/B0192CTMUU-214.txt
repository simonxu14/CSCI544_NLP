Harry Potter flies again!  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a marvelously plotted, superbly written book.  Once again, Rowling has taken us into her intricately built alternate world,  futher developing the characters and advancing toward the ultimate showdown between the powers of  good and evil.  Harry, Hermione, Ron and the whole Hogswart crew are now  young adults, with all that entails:  pimples, defying authority, and  (gasp!) noticing the opposite sex.  There is a hilarious chapter with  little magic, but many keen observations on just how a group of adolescent  wizards might pair up for their first dance.  Number 4 is darker in tone  than the first three books. Harry must realize that adults cannot solve all  problems, that danger, failure, and death may be the consequence of  challenging evil.  Worth staying up all night to read!
