The newest Harry Potter book, which is definitely the most hyped, is a very important book in terms of plot. For example, the green light from  Harry's dreams is identified as a spell, and Snape's past is finally  revealed. But is an explaining book an exiting book? In this case, yes. The  big showdown at the end is the best one yet, and even in the middle there  is almost as much action as the ends of previous Harry Potters. Is the  hyped-up fourth book worth taking your sister's Pikachu alarm clock and 101  Dalmatians sleeping bag to the bookstore or waiting a hundred years for the  FedEx truck? Consider these warnings first. If you have not read the third  book (&quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;), &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; ruins  &quot;Prisoner's&quot; surprise. And you shouldn't spend all night on it  like I did. Aside from that, go ahead! But it may not be worth all the  newspaper articles and yellow bookstore signs it got.
