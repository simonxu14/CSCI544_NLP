Harry Potter IV takes an amazing leap forward in complexity and intricacy compared to the first three in the series, but does it a level appropriate for the targeted age level.  Kids that read the Harry Potter series and,  especially, the forth book, are getting both a great story and a phenomenal  education in english, in grammar and in how to write a story.  By making  reading appealing to so many kids, J.K. Rowling has done children one of  the best favors that they will ever get.  Hats off to her (and to Harry  Potter!).
