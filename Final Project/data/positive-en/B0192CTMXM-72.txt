I would listen to Jim Dale read the phone book, but how awesome to have him read such a wonderfully crafted series as Harry Potter. He does excellent voices and brings a new life to the series. This is my favorite book in the series, and I was able to get the recorded version at a sensible price. If you can afford the books on CD, get them. Hours and hours of listening pleasure.
