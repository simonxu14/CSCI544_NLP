My son has trouble going to sleep and uses the Harry Potter discs for this purpose.  He needed 4 of the books on discs to finish the series, so I bought them for his birthday in October.  This is one of those he needed.  I have my own copies and listen to them frequently as I am still a Harry Potter fan!
