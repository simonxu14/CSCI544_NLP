This is a very good book. I have all the Harry Potter Books, 1 through 3, and I am going to either buy or probably borrow the book from the library in my town. The last few chapters are the best parts, I think.<br />Harry  Potter Books are good. Even though they are fiction, they are still fun to  read through. The next one is supposed to be very long. I just really like  reading it when I have my free time. I think everybody should buy this  book. I hope they make new books soon. In my country, they are coming out  on July 8. Have a good time reading this book! Good luck!
