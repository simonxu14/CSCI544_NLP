This was bigger and more beautiful than I expected.  The illustrations were beautiful, and I can't wait to see all the other editions.  My two suggestions: some pictures on two-page spreads have too much lost in the binding, I wish the cover under the dust jacket was more interesting (it's plain red, no embossing, nothing).
