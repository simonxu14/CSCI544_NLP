Harry Potter isn't for everyone. Harry Potter isn't the best book series ever written. But it is a good read, and that's all anyone can really ask for. This final volume has some very exciting and interesting parts, but loses points for dragging in several chapters, even though that dragging is understandable and kind of necessary to the plot. Fans will love or hate how the series ends, depending upon their personal preferences. I thought everything was wrapped up well enough.
