The illustrations in this book are absolutely stunning and because the book is so large the pictures are displayed large enough to see all of the detail.  My kids enjoy when I read this to them because now they have visual references! As a huge Harry Potter lover, this book is a must to own.  I cannot wait for the other to be released.
