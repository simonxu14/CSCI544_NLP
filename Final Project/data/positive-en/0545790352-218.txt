This book more than met my expectations.  So much so that I've preferred Chamber of Secrets.  The illustrations are beautiful and what can I say about JK Rowling's writing that hasn't been said a gazillion times before.  If you like Harry Potter, stories about magic, kid's stories, fantasy stories, or, just, great literature, it's well worth buying this book.
