This is our second copy, we wore out the first. This time bought hardcover to last the ages. My daughter read this at 11 for the first time, she has read it at least dozen times since and took it to college with her. Called me crying when the original paperback fell apart in her hands as she was reading it. I replaced it with this one. Well worth every penny.
