I am an adult, an RN, and a mom. I have read & enjoyed all of the Harry Potter books. However, I must say I enjoyed them much more in listening to them on tape, in my car during commutes to work,  because Jim Dale is such an excellent reader.  He does all the voices, male and female, young and old, and several different British accents.  He truly makes the books and their characters come alive.  Can't recommend highly enough listening to all the Potter books on tape or CD, even if you have read them. Would be great for long trips in the car with kids, as well.
