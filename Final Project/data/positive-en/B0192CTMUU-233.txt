For someone who does not usually enjoy fantasy books I was amazed at how enjoyable these books were.  I read the first one to see what all the hype  was about and was hooked!  Each book just gets better and better.  How  amazing is it for an author to write a series of books that appeals to such  a broad range of readers.  I'm a 47 yr old mom and we fight over who gets  these first at our house...me, my 15 yr old son, my 10 yr old daughter or  my husband!  What a goldmine this author has landed in.  If you haven't  read these yet, start with the first one.  Although I have heard of some  people who didn't like them (Personally, I think there's something wrong  with them), I bet you'll be hooked too.  We can't wait until book 5 is  out!
