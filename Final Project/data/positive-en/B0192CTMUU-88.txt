I read the first two Harry Potter books and then got the audio cassettes for number 3 and 4.  These books are great!  I listen to a lot of audio books because I drive a lot and I get sick of the radio after a while.  Some audio books are hard to keep paying attention to while listening.  That is not the case with this particular one.<br />There are 12 tapes that are 1 and 1/2 hour long.  I got so intrigued that I finished it within a week.  I listened while driving, cooking supper and even while doing some house painting.  The Goblet of Fire is delving further into the mystery of Harry and his world.  I am hooked and just can't wait for the next one.<br />If you don't have a lot of time to read and want to discover some true talent of story telling, try these books on audio.  It is a great story and the reader does an excellent job of changing his voice for different charachters and setting the scene for what is going on.<br />I can see why the man that read these books for audio recieved so many awards.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat!
