I really enjoyed the previous books in the series. I was given the set as a gift.  I eagerly awaited the arrival of this one in my mailbox -- and was most grateful that Amazon fed-exed it to me on the release date.  I was  thrilled with the size -- it's huge.  The story is wonderful.  The  characters grow more.  I'm recommending it to everyone!  Can't wait to read  these books to my kids when they are old enough!
