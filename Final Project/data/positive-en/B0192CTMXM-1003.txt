This book is excellent and lives up to Rowling's reputation as a writer.  Harry is so angry in this book but it is in line with the emotions and termoil that teenagers normally go through at this age.  Add that to all the other things with Voldermort, Deatheaters, and Dumbledore put him through and it makes for one explosive Harry.  The story also is hilarious at some points but very heart breaking at others.  I laughed, got very angry myself (with the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher) and cried throughout this book.  Harry needed to grow and learn about life and his past and this book fulfilled all that.
