I have to start by saying that I'm sorry the series had to end, I have enjoyed reading the books and seeing the movies.  With that said, this book grabs your attention from the beginning and never lets go.  It mentions things from past books, brings in all our favorite, and maybe not so favorite characters, and reaches a climax a long time coming.  The final few pages ties the whole thing together leaving the reader with a good feeling of closure.<br /><br />J.K. Rowling should be very proud of what she has accomplished with this series.  It says a lot about an author that can write a book that both children and adults want to read and I for one, thank her.
