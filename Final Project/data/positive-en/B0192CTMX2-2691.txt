This is one of the few books that I've read that is difficult to review with a star rating system. I think I could easily write a five star review, as well as a one star one. Does that make it three stars? I ended up with five stars. First of all, if you are a Harry Potter fan, of course you are going to read it. If you've never read a Harry Potter book, this is not the one to start with. You would be totally lost.<br /><br />Since it had been a while since I had read the other books, I started by reading them all again. There were so many little details that I think I would have missed had I not done that. As an adult, I enjoyed the books the second time as much as I did the first.<br /><br />For me, the detractions from this book are plot related, things I didn't like. But, that could be personal preference and have nothing to do with the merits of the book. Nothing can change the magic that J.K. Rowling has created over the years with these books.<br /><br />This book is violent, in fact, there is way too much death and violence in my opinion for young children. That to me is a shame, they were such an inspiration for children to read. I won't give away any spoilers (which makes the book hard to review!) But, I feel that in most cases the deaths that happened served no purpose in the story, it was like the author was seeing who she could kill off to shock people. Of course, I didn't like the turn the story was taking at the end of the last book when that character was killed. That could prejudice my views on this book.<br /><br />It is odd to be critical of a book that I've given 5 stars too. I do think it could have been a better book, but it had to end in some manner and I can't take away from it just because I didn't like the twists and turns in the story.<br /><br />Thanks J.K. Rowling for a wonderful series and for sharing your imagination with us.
