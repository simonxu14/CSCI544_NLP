The final book in the series.  The ongoing battle between Voldemort and Harry Potter finally reaches its culmination, and loose ends are wrapped up.  The last book left us with the impression that Harry would not return to Hogwarts, and indeed he, Ron and Hermione go on a quest for Horcruxes instead of heading back to school, in the hopes that gathering and destroying the Horcruxes will finally destroy Voldemort forever.  Of course it's not quite that simple, and as Rowling warned us, we lose a few beloved characters on the way towards the final confrontation.<br /><br />At the risk of being lynched by fellow Potter lovers, I have to say that I was a little disappointed in this final installment, which should have been the best one and should have put a terrific final cap on what has been a truly groundbreaking and brilliant series.  Rowling is as engaging as ever, but I was very disappointed in the way she wrapped up certain elements.  I expected much more development of the Snape situation, for instance.  The reason behind his hatred for Harry was exactly what I thought it was, so I felt vindicated there, but I did not like the quick, rather cop-out method Rowling used to finish that story line.  Similarly, I expected further development of Draco and Harry's tense relationship, given the occurrences in the book 6 and the other side of Draco we glimpsed there.  Some people feel that it was developed exactly as it should have been, so this is just my personal opinion and what I personally had hoped for.<br /><br />The climactic scene was unique and innovative, I thought, and I liked the way she played that out.  I was a little less impressed by the epilogue - a bit too neat, I thought.<br /><br />Overall, though, this has been one of the most entertaining series' I have ever, ever read, and I anticipate reading it from start to finish many more times.
