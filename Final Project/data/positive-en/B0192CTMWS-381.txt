Read this book if you haven't yet and you follow the Harry Potter series. If you don't follow the series, please do so. It isn't just children stories, it's actually better than the movies. I read this book in two days just like everyone else I know who read it. You just can't put it down. All the previous books that left a question in your mind will be answered. Your theories of what really happened at the end of book six will unfold.<br /><br />Everywhere I go, people are reading it --the subway, bus, on the sidewalk, etc.
