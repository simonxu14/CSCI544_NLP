I bought this for my nine year old grandson, and ever since he opened it Christmas morning he has been reading it. He uses it for  cross reference, fun reading, and to learn more about Pokemon. He loves it. His 26 year old uncle was reading through it and pronounced it an excellent book.  If you know a Pokemon lover I highly recommend you get this book for them.
