My favorite of all of the books. I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and have read all of the books multiple times. But I have read this one, and book five (Order of the Phoenix) the most frequently. This book has some unexpected surprises and some great resolutions. It is amazing that JK Rowling was able to keep certain relationships a secret until this book was published. Well done.
