When I got the Harry Potter book, my expectations for it were fairly high, considering the length of time it took Mrs. Rowling to write it. I was also ready to criticize, being a bit frustrated having waiting this long. But once I started the book, I could not stop.<br />All 870 pages were thrilling, humorous and suspensful. The charaters develop so much in the fifth installment to the Harry Potter series. Since Harry's fourth year in Hogwarts, the Ministry refuses to believe that Harry's story about Voldemort arising is true, and try to convince the rest of the Magic population that it isn't true either.<br />Harry and Dumbledore try all they can to pursuade people that the Ministry is wrong, and that they have to be prepared for You-Know-Who. But Professor Umbridge, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher sent by the Ministry, is not letting them, by teaching in a different way. But Professor Umbridge is not only disliked by the students for her odd way in teaching, but by the other professors as well.<br />As much as everyone would like to deny the fact that Voldemort is returning, there is still an orginization called The Order of the Phoenix which tries to get as much information as possible on Voldemort as possible, and try their best to look after Harry. But Harry's scar seems to be hurting more often, and this tiem Harry can feel what Voldemort himself is feeling.<br />In this fun and suspensful book, you can go through the same journey as Harry and his friends go through, and realize different truths that Dumbledore will finally explain to Harry, that has lingered in his mind for the bast 15 years.
