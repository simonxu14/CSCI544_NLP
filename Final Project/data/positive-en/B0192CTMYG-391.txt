Yes it is derivative.  No it is not Tolkein or Lewis or Tolstoy or Dante but that's ok!  This was one week's escapist reading (half an hour in the evenings) after very stressful work days and that was more than enough for me.  As a psychologist I was facinated with the sorting hat and the endless issues raised  grouping children of like values, character, traits, etc.  Looking forward to the rest of the series.
