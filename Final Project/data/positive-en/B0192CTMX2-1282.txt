The book was well worth the wait - I started reading it and had difficulty putting it down!  Without giving too much away, I laughed, and yes, I cried too. Some questions were finally answered regarding Harry...Suffice to say, I'm already impatient for the 6th book and am hoping that it won't be another 3 years!!!
