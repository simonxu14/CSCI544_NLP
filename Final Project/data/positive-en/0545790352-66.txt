I purchased this book for my son and partly for myself. My son is an infant but he loves looking at pictures during story time, I love Harry Potter. This book is perfection, the illustrations are gorgeous and the pages are large enough that the book isn't super thick. I now get to make sure my son grows up enjoying Harry Potter due to these illustrated works of art.
