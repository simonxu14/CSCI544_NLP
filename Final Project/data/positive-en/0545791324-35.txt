This is another volume of the illustrated series of Harry Potter. Each page has some kind of illustrated detail on it which really makes it a joy to read. The illustrations are excellent, leaving the reader eager to read the next volume when it comes out. It's worth owning even if you already have this book in non-illustrated edition.
