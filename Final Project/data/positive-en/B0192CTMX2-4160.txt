I know a lot of people had waited for so long for this book and after reading it people said, "It is not as good as the others". But I know that this book is other than others, the people who only said that is that they dissaprove J.K. Rowling making Sirius died (which I am sad about that), but still don't just get that one reason and rate the 5th book a bad book!!!
