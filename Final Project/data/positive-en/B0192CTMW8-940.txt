The book took just about a week from when I placed the order to when it arrived. Excellent condition, no tog ears, torn pages or anything.<br /><br />The only thing that bothered me is the original price tag from the inside of the book jacket was clipped off. Beyond that, however, it's almost like it's brand new!
