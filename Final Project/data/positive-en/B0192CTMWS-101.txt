Probably the best book of the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is an amazing read that will have you laughing, crying and on the edge of your seat. JK Rowling has a unique writing style that keeps you enthralled from beginning to endâ€”I literally can't put these books down! Just as good reading it the 10th time as the first, you won't regret taking this magical trip with Harry and his friends through the trials and tribulations they go through at Hogwarts!
