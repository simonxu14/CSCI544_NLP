If your children are in an &#34;Accelerated Reader&#34; program at school and looking for books to keep them interested while improving their AR level .. look no more. The Harry Potter series is exactly what you'll need. My daughter meets her goals before everyone in the class and asks for more books. It was a very good decision to purchase this.
