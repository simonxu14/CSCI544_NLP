For years I balked at reading the Harry Potter series.  In my thirties, with a lifelong distaste for Star Wars and The Hobbitt, and a preference for non-fiction reading, I knew there was no way I'd enjoy these stories which were obviously for children only.  Was I ever wrong!  When Order of the Phoenix came out this summer, I finally gave in and decided to give all the Harry books a try.  And now I'm completely hooked.  When Rowling says she never consciously set out to write a children's book, she's not kidding.  She sure knows how to tell a story that captivates people at any age!  Although it's hard to choose a favorite, Goblet of Fire is mine.  The intricate plot never lets up through all 700 plus pages, and the characters are more vibrant, mature, witty and sympathetic than ever.  The nail-biting ending does not disappoint, and you'll practically tear the pages just to get to it faster.  If you appreciate an excellent story that captivates as well as Wizard of Oz and Gone With The Wind ever did, then pick up Goblet of Fire and read the rest of the Potter series as well.  It doesn't matter what age you are either - Goblet will blissfully (and sometimes painfully) bring you back to age 14, with an added dose of magic to spicen things up.
