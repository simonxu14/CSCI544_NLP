This is a marvelous work; well written, imaginative and delightful for audiences of all ages. If you will permit a brief aside, it is quite  amazing to see how the New York Times, in its infinite wisdom, has changed  the format of its bestseller lists to &quot;create&quot; a new children's  books category (not that iteally matters). Is it perhaps to reflect the  growing popularity of this category? Or maybe it is to soothe the fragile  egos and tender sensibilities of our intellectual elite who, despite their  expanding arrogance, have been left in the commercial dust by a writer of  mere children's books. Heaven help us!  Ms. Rowling has moved her readers,  touching their hearts and stimulating their minds in a way that this sorry  collection of bluster and pomposity has failed to do. It is this same  condescension demonstrated by those of similar mind set which has kept the  Harry Potter books receiving literary prizes and awards.<br />Yet while the  so-called intellectual elite sip their wine and nibble on cheese, the rest  of us, adults and children alike, while perhaps not with the delicate  &quot;pinkies-out&quot; sensibilities the tea and croissant crowd, will  revel in our collective ignorance and enjoy this absolutely marvelous work  of fiction (all of the books in the series are great fun).  Barbarians all,  we recognize that the purpose of literature is to inspire, to enlighten, to  stimulate and to entertain. The great joy in this is the misery of our  cerebral friends as they squirm and wriggle in collective dismay at the  success of a writer of popular fiction. What's next? Pulitzer's for  Fabio-covered romance novels? Booker's for HOW TO BUILD A BARBECUE? Truly  the savages are at the doorstep.
