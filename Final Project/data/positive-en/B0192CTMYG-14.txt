There has been some dispute about the quality of the translation of this edition, as well as about the quality of the reading aloud. Having listened to most of it countless times and played portions of it for several spanish speakers, including two teachers who are native speakers from Venezuela, I can attest with, I think, some authority that both the translation and the spoken quality are excellent.<br /><br />The character voices, in my opinion, are wonderful for both children and adults. I'm amazed and impressed that the reader was able to come up with such a convincing variety of different voices, including wonderful voices for Harry, Uncle Vernon, the Brazilian boa constrictor, McGonagall, Dumbledore, Hagrid, Madam Hooch, Snape and others.<br /><br />This set of CDs is a delight. I can't get enough of it. Listening to it -- over and over and over, along with the Spanish text, the English text, and a Spanish-English dictionary -- has improved my own Spanish skills immeasurably.<br /><br />Lest you think this review might be a "shill" effort, I hasten to add that I have no connection with the author, the translator, the publishers, or the out-loud-reader.<br /><br />But, like the Dursleys, I do have a secret: I'm a big fan of the whole Harry Potter series in the original English text.<br /><br />By the way, for reading in English I recommend the original ENGLISH edition, not the altered American edition. Even the title "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" makes more sense: finding a Philosopher's Stone was the traditional goal of medieval alchemists, one of whom was named Nicholas Flamel (!)
