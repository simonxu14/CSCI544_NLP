This is one of the longest in the Harry Potter series. Harry returns to Hogwarts School of Wizardry for a 4th year. The triwizard tournament happens this year, and even though Harry is not old enough to volunteer, someone puts is nme in the Goblet of Fire, and he gets chosen to play in the dangerous tournament.<br /><br />The book is absorbing, but at times, you wonder if it could have been shorter. Still, it is essential reading.
