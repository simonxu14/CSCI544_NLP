J. K., I thoroughly enjoyed reading your screenplay very much and I look forward to seeing the movie tomorrow to observe how closely the movie mirrors the book. Harry Potter movies were great at following the story so I expect that will still hold true here. I highly recommend reading the screenplay to everyone interested in reading a great story. Thanks for all the memories!
