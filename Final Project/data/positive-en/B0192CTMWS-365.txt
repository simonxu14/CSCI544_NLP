Yes I am sixty years old, and find the adventures of HarryPotter &quot;magical&quot;. ...I have the audio cassettes and thebooks themselves. The cassettes, I love to listen to Jim Daley masterfully capture the very essence of the characters. He is an actor I have always admired. The books, I keep hoping to be able to read them to other children at some time. I am an English lady living in Houston. What a delightful style J.K.Rowling has of telling stories and holding the interest of the reader, thank you. Adults can get just as caught up in Harry and friends, as children.
