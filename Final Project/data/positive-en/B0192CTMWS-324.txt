Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is an imaginative, mostly exciting, and entertaining novel.<br /><br />I'd like to comment on two criticisms of this book.  One was that things dragged a bit when Harry, Ron and Hermione were wandering around Britain.  I would agree.  Another was that the Epilogue was trite.  Here I would mostly disagree.  Perhaps because I'm older, I can recognize great joy in "everyday" life.  Do we always need the bad to appreciate the good?<br /><br />This book and the entire Harry Potter series are not perfect.  What is?  But I gave Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows 5 stars, because it's such a terrific and amazing story.  So much "serious" fiction is rather dull psychologizing.  The primary characteristic of great fiction, in my opinion, should be a great story.  This surely is it.
