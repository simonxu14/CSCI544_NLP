I ordered this book for my 7 year old son and he loves it! It was a reward for good behavior at school and has totally paid off. He carries this thing around with him everywhere. I saw on some reviews complaints about poor quality or missing pages, but we haven't experienced any of that. It is a good quality book, well bound, and pretty thick. All pages are intact, no blurring or anything like that.<br />This book also helped my son get a better idea of how the video games work, so he's enjoying them more now since he has a better understanding. I would definitely recommend this book for any child interested in Pok&eacute;mon.
