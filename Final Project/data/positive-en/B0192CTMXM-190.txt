Kudos to J.K. Rowling for a fitting and fantastic end to the Harry Potter series. She has fulfilled all of our hopes for the Boy Wizard and his friends while staying true to life and magic. Not everyone survives and we are saddened by some of the losses. Others get their final comeuppance - usually well-deserved. And there are surprises- oh yes, there are surprises.<br /><br />Rowling's writing and characters have grown as the series has progressed. Literary "critics" can always find fault, but until one of them comes up with characters and stories like this, I figure it's just the jealous rantings of those-who-can't! I, for one, have enjoyed the joys, trials, successes and tribulations of Harry, Hermione, Ron and all the wizards and witches of this magical world since day 1. I was not disappointed and I don't think you will be either.
