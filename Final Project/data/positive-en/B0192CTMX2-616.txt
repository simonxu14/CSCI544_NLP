My copy arrived Saturday morning. I started it Saturday afternoon, retruned to it Sunday morning after the crossword, and finished it mid-afternoon. Much has been made of the length, but the story was gripping and the chapters flew by.<br />It's hard to review without delivering spoilers... I'll do my best. The darkness that runs through the story comes from several sources, some expected, some surprising; You-Know-Who and his followers, of course, but they are (unwittingly, one hopes) abetted by a wizard government that behaves in untrustworthy and Harry-hating fashion. Add to this the turmoil of Harry's turning 15 while living his life entirely on display, friends who turn against him, several loved ones put into mortal danger, mentors who let him down, and the truly poisonous persona of Dolores Umbridge, and you have a book that is less whimsical, more complex, and more deeply felt than most.<br />Even in the darkness, however, humor still lurks... Fred and George Weasley are testing potential products for their joke shop, and even the most mild-mannered Hogwarts professors have funny little ways of meeting the challenges presented by Professor Umbridge. And the relationships between Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, the Weasley family, Sirius, and other regular characters continue to be developed, often in touching ways. What has protected Harry from the moment of his mother's death, after all, is love... and love lies at the heart of the tale.
