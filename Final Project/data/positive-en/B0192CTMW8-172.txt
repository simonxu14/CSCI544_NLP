Always love the Harry Potter series.  My gift is the beginning of my young friend's experience at HEARING it read by the amazing Mr. Dale.  In my view, the books came to life in a much different way from reading it myself.  A wonderful experience, that I'm glad to share.  I believe that the item was received on time for her to open it during the holiday break.  thanks<br />s
