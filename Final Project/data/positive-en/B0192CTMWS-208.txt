OOTP is a very decent book, but it does has a bit of length to it that even Rowling thinks is a tad indulgent. It is easily the longest of the series, but tends to drag in a few portions. The movie did a good job of tightening up the narrative and kicking the pace up a notch. While I still enjoy the book, the movie feels a bit smoother.<br /><br />For instance, the a good bit of the early chapters are mostly Harry and company cleaning up number 12 Grimmauld place to be suitable headquarters for the order. As fascinating as that is, we don't really need to learn how to clean curtains or dressers. Bit boring really.<br /><br />In the department of mysteries,  Harry and his buddies bumble about into different rooms of seemingly no importance. Room with brains? Room with Time Turner powder, room with galaxies? I get that the department needs to be interesting, but I think having Harry look for the prophecy amongst the shelves was plenty interesting enough. Then the fight that follows goes on way too long. They are chased from room to room and back again. The movie made everything much tighter.<br /><br />There are two scenes with Dumbledore that were much better in the book than in the film.<br />1. In his office when Delores Umbridge comes to remove him from the grounds. The movie doesn't quite have the tension that the book did. He quickly dispatches the 3 aurors, Delores, and Percy Weasley. He then tells Harry and Minerva that he is leaving and to act like no time as passed as to confuse his would be dispatchers.<br />2. Dumbledore's fight with Voldemort is much better in the book. Voldemort uses three Avada Kadavra curses on Dumbledore that he is able to dodge. Dumbledore bewitches the wizard fountain and the statues come to life and aid him in his fight.<br /><br />Harry's possession by Voldemort is also much different. Harry (as Voldemort) tells Dumbledore to kill him if he wants to win. Harry briefly thinks to himself that death might be ok as he would be able to see Sirius again. This moment of affection for his godfather causes Voldemort to loosen his grip and flee. In the movie, Harry has a bit of a rant about how Voldemort will never know love and how he pities him. Seems a little heavy handed compared to the novel.<br /><br />There are many pros and cons between the two, but the length just cannot be excused. It is a long read and honestly could be much shorter. Still a worthy entry in the series
