I have all of the Harry Potter audio series, because I prefer to listen or watch fictional storie than to read them.  Just a preference of mine.  The audio series is great. I listened to them at home on my back patio and while in the car on a road trip.  THEY ARE VERY DETAILED, ENGAGING AND JUST PLAIN FUN TO LISTEN TO.
