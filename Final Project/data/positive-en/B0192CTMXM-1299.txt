What an enjoyable ending to 4000 pages of fun with Harry, Hermione and Ron.  While the story lagged a bit in the middle, the ending more than made up for any lull.  I would have loved to see a more detailed epilogue, but any ending is better than nothing!  Thank you Ms. Rowling for 8 years of magic!
