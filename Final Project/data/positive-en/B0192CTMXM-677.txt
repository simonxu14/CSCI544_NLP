I started with Harry Potter books 4 years ago, when the first movie came out. Rowling has been getting  better in the story telling and details on characters and the scene.<br /><br />This book is the best among all 7 in respect of story telling. It starts with a bang and keeps the momentum. There are no useless chapters. Every scene or a situation is tied very closely to the story. Every page either answers your questions from previous books or creates new questions.<br /><br />The book explains to us that even a good person can have some skeletons in his closet from past. Whether they are relavent  to today is the question.<br /><br />The characters have already been built in previous books. In this book we see them at their peak. Ron, Hermoine, Harry, Weasleys and all other important characters have a significant role in the story. Ron , as usual, a little unsure of himself, always the second best, excels in his role. We see Hermoine mature further. Harry shows big leadership qualities and also tells us that sometimes even leaders make mistakes.<br /><br />Voldemort shows his power and his weakness.<br /><br />Harry meets all his enemies. The book is full of action and does not bore for even a second. I hope the movie makers this time make a 4 hour long movie to do any justice to this book.
