If I could I would give this 6 stars!  I'm so excited to receive my copy of the illustrated Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  I've been reading the series since it came out, and of course loved the movies as they were released.  Now as a mom I look forward to introducing my boys to the world of Harry Potter when they are old enough.  I'm going to keep ordering the illustrated versions as they are released.<br /><br />I have not yet started reading the book but have paged through the illustrations and I'm amazed at the beauty of each page.  Can't wait to re-introduce myself to Harry, Ron, Hermione and the gang!
