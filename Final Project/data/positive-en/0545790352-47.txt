Beautiful book, wonderful illustrations.  I bought this book because I'm a Harry Potter fan and have gotten each of the versions as they've been released - original, digital, audio, movies, and now the illustrated Potter.  What I didn't expect was to fall in love with the book and the world of Hogwarts all over again.  I'm anxiously awaiting the rest of the books to be released.<br /><br />The book itself is large and printed on heavy, glossy paper, and loaded with pictures ranging from tiny to two-page illustrations.  I've seen some reviews which said that the spine has broken but my copy has held up well.
