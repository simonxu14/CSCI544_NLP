Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows more than lives up to expectations as the final denoument of the Harry Potter epic. Complex and skilfully written, J.K.Rowling delves into the (now beloved) characters as we have not seen before, revealing depth, inner angst, confusion and courage as Harry and his friends are thrown into the storm-of-the-century of good versus evil. Casting themselves adrift from the safety and comfort of Hogwarts and their teachers and mentors, Harry, Hermione and Ron must struggle with their own demons as they search for the seven Horcruxes. This turns out to be like looking for a black cat on a dark night, as even Harry has little idea of where to go or what to look for. Compounding their dilemma is the idea of the three Deathly Hallows--should Harry be looking for Hallows or the Horcruxes? Which will ultimately lead to the defeat of the Dark Lord?<br />J.K.Rowling's masterful use of this complex journey in the unfolding of the Harry Potter climax is riveting. The care and sensitivity she uses in creating the inner journeys of the Harry, Ron and Hermione allows us to feel the uncertainty, the pain, fear and self-doubt they experience as they are tested again and again as the Dark Lord's circle of power tightens around them. This is a book worth re-reading several times, to truly mine the depths begun and nurtured throughout the entire series.<br /><br />Meredith Kennedy, Author of 'The Red Jacket.'
