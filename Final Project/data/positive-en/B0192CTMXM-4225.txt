I was very sad to hear that this was going to be the last book in the series.  Like so many others, I have gotten caught up in the world of Harry Potter and his friends.  However, I was very pleased to get my copy yesterday.  It's a daunting book - must weigh a good three pounds!  However, it caught my interest from the first page.<br /><br />The story takes up, as with her other books, a couple months after the last one.  Lord Valdemor and the Death-Eaters are gaining more power and have infiltrated the Ministry of Magic.  The enchantment on the house at Privet Drive is going to disappear the day Harry turns 17 and the Order of the Pheonix is about to move him.  This starts the point at which Harry is on the run.<br /><br />In additional, before he died, Dumbledore gave Harry a task to complete with Ron & Hermone, but no one else is to know about it.  The nust complete it or Lord Vademore will win.  As the book progresses, the situation worsens.  Lord Vademore appears to be winning.  He's got the Ministry and Hogwarts under his control. The war has started and the Order of the Pheonix appears to be losing.<br /><br />The story flows very well and most of the previous characters get at least a cameo appearance.  At the end of the book, all the different plots from the different books are tied together.  There are no loose ends.<br /><br />This is a great story and I think in general the Harry Potter books have been very good for children.  Any book that can capture a child's imagination enough to keep the reading is wonderful.  However, this is more violent than the previous tales (it's about a war after all) and parts of it may be distressing for the younger children.  I recommend this book and the series in general to any adult and older children.
