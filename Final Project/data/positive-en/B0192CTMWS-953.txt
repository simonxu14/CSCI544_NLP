I just finished this book and now will have to wait impatiently for the 6th book. Anyways, Rowling did throw some nice curve balls in the book, but was well worth the wait. The one thing that has puzzled me after reading it is why wasn't Harry asked to join the "Order of the Phoenix" yet. I know he is supposed to be to young and all, yet he does so much. And the other thing that is curiously unanswered was that the anger he was displaying from the connection between him and Voldermont or just teenage puberty? hehehe...Anyways, it does read pretty fast for 870 pages and I can't wait to see it in the movies and maybe catch some other things I missed. Good luck with reading it and have a nice day!<br />MD
