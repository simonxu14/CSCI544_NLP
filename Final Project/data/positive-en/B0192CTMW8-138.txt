As a middle-aged mother, school counselor, and Jane Austen fanatic, I never thought I would be obsessed with a series of books written for children.  Granted, I love children's literature and use books extensively in my counseling programs but Harry Potter has grabbed my heart and is constantly tugging it!  Books become classics when they not only stand the tests of time, but when they can appeal to all ages.  These Harry Potter Books become classics the day they become published!  THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS is another powerfully written, dear and sweet novel about the adventures of Harry Potter and his two best friends.  This book is about how good wins over evil but the exploits that the children get involved in are so delicious, so compelling, that only the hardest hearts would be able to put down these books.
