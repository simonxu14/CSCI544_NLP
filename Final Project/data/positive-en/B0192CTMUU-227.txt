I'm 28, I'm a graduate student and I really love Harry Potter. In this book, different from the first three, it's more emotional since Harry and his friends get older. It's the start point that Harry and friends start  realizing about each other as &quot;boys and girls&quot;. But, as it's  always shown in every book, the freindship and caring among Harry, Ron and  Hermione is still be found. (and to be honest, it always makes me happy).  This new adventure of Harry is much more dangerous than he ever had  before including the rebirth of the Dark lord which caused a death of  somebody (you have to read it to find out who he was.) J.K Rowling also  gave some mysteries that you have to find out in her following books. This  book is just not for kids.. Recommended!
