If you read the other six books, you will read this one.  The author ties all of it together with a good ending (only one major fatal casualty).  Without spoiling the ending, let me say she keeps true to the original story without selling out.  (I know, that told you nothing, but then you need to read the book to find out what happened; or you can wait and see the two movies--but it is better to read the book first, then see the movies).
