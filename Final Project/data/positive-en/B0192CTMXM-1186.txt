Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows was all I thought it would be, a fitting end to the saga that didn't disappoint.  Having listened to this last book read by Jim Dale, I now plan to go back to the beginning and listen to all of them as recorded books.  Mr Dale is a masterful reader.  You truly can imagine all the characters through his ingenious characterizations.  I recommend this book highly!
