I received the book Saturday morning from Amazon (Who get high marks for their Saturday delivery!).  I finished the book yesterday because I couldn't put it down after page 178.<br />The book was well worth the wait and would have received 5 stars from me, however there were some ridiculous mistakes that should have been caught during at least the final edit.  There aren't just a couple of run on sentences and missing verbs, it was rampant.<br />Knowing that not everybody has read the book yet, I'm only going to say this about the plot: there were some things that should have been tied up at the end that never were.  Namely, it was the ultimate fate of Umbridge and whether or not the Ministry of Magic would be able to exert as much control over Hogwarts, which was a major theme in this book.<br />I really enjoyed the book and I'm sure that J.K. Rowling will let us know in the next book the fate of Umbridge's less than successful tenure at Hogwarts.  If you're not done with the book yet, call in sick to work tomorrow and finish the book.
