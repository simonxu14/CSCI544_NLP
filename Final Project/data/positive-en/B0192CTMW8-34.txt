I loved this book. The characters are so likable, especially the Weasley's. Gilderoy Lockhart is hilarious! So many funny things happen in Chamber of Secrets. It is a very creative & imaginative book. The muggle car & the whomping willow is a favorite. I love the way people in pictures wander out of their frames & into others; the way the staircases move and the house ghosts fly all over.<br />Of the 7 books in the series Chamber of Secrets is my favorite.
