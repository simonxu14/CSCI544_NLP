I want to say thanks to JKR - this series has really altered what we read, what we perceive a book should be, and will do so for a looooonnngg time.<br />The last installment blows you away - everything about it was wondrous - yes, there are many deaths, but there are many triumphs that have those deaths not be in vain.<br />This book explains the actions of Snape, one of my favorites in the series, and all loose ends tie together in amazing ways -<br />To me, then ending is perfect - others have found it too story book.
