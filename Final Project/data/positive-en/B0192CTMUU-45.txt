This long-awaited book was snatched up by kids and parents all around the country.  Some of you may think the excitement was a little overrated.  You won't if you read the book.  This book was as good as the first ones, if  not better.  Although the book is a little deeper and darker than the other  ones, it is still just as light and airy as ever, but the author uses some  of the extra pages (nearly 300 more than the third one) to explore the  characters personalitites better.  We get to know them better and we also  have some new characters introduced to us.  We learn more about  He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named (Voldemort) and his reign of terror.  The book  never lags in interest as we watch the characters progress.<br />Harry  wants to get away from the pernicious Dursleys and go to the International  Quidditch Cup with Hermione, Ron, and the Weasleys.  He wants to dream  about Cho Chang, his crush (and maybe do more than dream).  He wants to  find out about the mysterious event that's supposed to take place at  Hogwarts this year, an event involving two other rival schools of magic and  a competition that hasn't happened for a hundred years.  He wants to be a  normal, fourteen-year-old wizard.  Unfortunately for Harry Potter, he's not  normal--even by wizarding standards.  And in this case, different can be  deadly.<br />From the mysterious beginning, to the fast-paced middle, to the  hanging end, this book is every bit as good and has as many twists and  revelations as the first three.  In fact, it only leaves you wanting one  thing:  the fifth one right at hand to start the second you finish this  one.
