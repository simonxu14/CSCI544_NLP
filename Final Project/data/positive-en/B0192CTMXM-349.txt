Now that my son has &#34;come of age&#34; and is ready to be introduced to the brilliant, wonderful imaginative wizarding world that J.K. Rowling created, I've been rereading the books with him and finding them (now that I'm reading them back-to-back rather than breathlessly waiting for the next book to be released) even more sophisticated, mature and thrilling than they were in my (very fond) memories. Each book matures along with Harry, and the humor and true emotion is always present and accounted for. This series is simply a modern classic that will continue to delight generations for years to come.
