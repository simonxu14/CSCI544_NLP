Before I started in on Harry Potter 7, I had this idea that JK would leave the door open to write another Harry Potter book down the road, that she just couldn't leave it alone having crafted such a wonderful series. That, after too long a spell of not scheming up a new script, she would be compelled to write one "final" sequel.<br /><br />But alas, after reading HP 7, I am pretty convinced she's put the wraps on this exceptional creation. Granted, there are a variety of ways new novels could spring from the wizarding world of Harry, Ron, Hermione and the rest of the cast, but it seems JK has made it clear to us that she has completed the series.<br /><br />In so doing, she accomplished once again what she clearly accomplished with Books 1-6: a virtually effortless reading experience with a plot that can be thorougly enjoyed (at different levels) by all ages of readers.<br /><br />Harry Potter books, for me, produce an awe and appreciation of the author's attention to detail, a truly delightful humor, an opportunity to be personally challenged by the moral choices we make as we move through life, and an inspiration to EACH and EVERY one of us that we CAN tap our creative juices and bring something beautiful into this world.<br /><br />Note: all HP books are loaded with British expressions. I kept by my side a dictionary that had virtually every piece of British slang that JK used. (The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, available through Amazon, was very helpful)<br /><br />Thank you, J.K. Rowling, for your tremendous contributions to the world of fiction!
