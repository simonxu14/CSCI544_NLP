I read the book before I bought the tapes - I had read books 3 and 4 and listened to the audio tapes/CD's of 1 and 2.  I loved the books and all the characters - Jim Dale just has a way of bringing it all back with style.  I was amazed to discover that he does all the voices for all the characters -- he does this so darn well too!  You can just envision what is going on and see so well through the 'eyes' of his voice to the book's characters!  Jim Dale should win all awards for his wonderful work from a wonderful book!  I have loved listening to all the audio books of Harry Potter!  What a performance!<br />I'm listening to the tapes for the second time!  Well worth the money and time!!!!!
