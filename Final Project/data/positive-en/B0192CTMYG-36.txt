bought as a gift for my nephew who had been begging me for my harry potter books. I am not giving that kid MY harry Potter books, I mean I love him, but I love my Harry Potter too. I didn't even let my daughter read MY Harry Potter books... She's rough on books, she got her own set. SO yeah, great story. I'm expecting my owl any day now with my letter saying I have been accepted into hogwarts and I can leave the dreary world of muggles behind.
