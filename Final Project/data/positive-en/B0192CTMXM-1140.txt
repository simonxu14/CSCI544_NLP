Most fantasy series have trouble ending.  They drag and leave the reader feeling unfulfilled at a rushed conclusion.  Just look at any of Robert Jordan's books.  Or, they last forever like R.A. Salvatore's books.  J.K. Rowling has done something amazing in how she ended this book.  She satisfies all of your expectations, and leaves you content that the book has ended.  I mean, I'd prefer more books, but Rowling has truly ended the series.
