Harry Potter is beloved in our family so I had to add this illustrated version to our book collection.  It doesn't disappoint.  It was a joy to see the beautiful illustrations by Jim Kay and the attention to detail is impressive.  If you love Harry, you'll love this. It's a hefty book and quite a bit larger than the other versions.  Can't wait for the next one.
