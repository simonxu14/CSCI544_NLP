This is my favorite book in the series, and by the end of it I wanted to hug Harry and squee like a happy, squeeing thing. I bought a used library binding hardcover edition of Deathly Hallows and stayed up all day and night to read it (it took me 14 hours to get through it). The pages have pretty much left the binding at this point, but it continues to be one of, if not the, most read book in my collection.
