I bought this to share the magic of Harry Potter with my 9-year-old daughter.  We're actually reading it together (her in English and me in Spanish since I'm in college for foreign languages) and re-experiencing it all over again both for myself and vicariously through her is an experience that can't be beat. Any of the Harry Potter books are sure things that can not disappoint.
