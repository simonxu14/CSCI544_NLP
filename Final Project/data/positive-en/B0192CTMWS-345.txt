Probably the most widely anticipated novel in the past century by children and adults alike. It was well worth the wait. While there were a few repetitive scenes roaming the forest that were reminiscent of the never ending buffalo running in Dancing with Wolves, the majority of the plot moved along with "ah-ha" moments. J. K. Rowling neatly tied up almost all the details that you have been wondering about in the last six books. While I cheated and looked to the last chapter before I began reading the book, it was still a pleasure finding out how all the charachters got there. I am just sad that it is all over. I also wonder what happened to the Dursleys.
