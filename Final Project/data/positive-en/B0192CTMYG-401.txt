A wonderful children's story with a few good lessons about life, particularly about the power of love: &quot;to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever.&quot; I couldn't agree more: the confidence that comes from having  been loved and being loved is the seed of Harry Potter's greatness, and  ours, too.
