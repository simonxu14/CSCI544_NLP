When the frenzy over this book started, I knew I was missing something, so I bought and read all three before starting on this one.  I devoured them.  This book was terrific.  If you like reading (yes, in general), then you  should give this book a try.  I didn't think I would enjoy it, but I  did.<br />The only sad part is that there are still 14 more months until HP5  comes out!
