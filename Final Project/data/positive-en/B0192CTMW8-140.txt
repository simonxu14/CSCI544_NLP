There's nothing left to add to the barrage of words written about these wonderful books.  So let me just add a few regarding the audio versions, which strangely, are more easily available on Amazon than in my local bookstores.  I can't imagine that reading the books is a better intellectual or emotional experience: Jim Dale's performance is pitch-perfect.  Each character is so fully realized that the tapes sound more like one-man shows than book readings.  I listen to audiobooks during a relatively long commute and I judge them by my unwillingness to get out of the car before the end of a chapter.  The Harry Potter audio series is worth a few otherwise pointless trips around the block.  Oh, yeah, kids seem to like it too.
