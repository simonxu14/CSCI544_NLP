OotP was a good book in the Harry Potter series but it is definitely not intended for JK Rowling's child audience. It is much darker and full of angst. If you are a fan of the Harry Potter series like I am, you will most likely enjoy it, but my favorite is still the 3rd book. I wouldn't start with this one if you haven't read any of the others however. Start with the first book or the movies. You may follow the plot but you won't enjoy it nearly as much.
