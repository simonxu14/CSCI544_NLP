I would like to point out that I am a huge Harry Potter nerd and own all the movies, but I realized I couldn't call myself a true fan if I have not read the books. Even though the writing was simplistic (obviously since it is considered a middle grade book), the story telling is fantastic and enjoyable for all ages. J.K. Rowling knows how to articulate a great story and keep her audience guessing, with her interesting characters and surprising plot twist. I am so impressed by her creative imagination. This series is legendary for a reason, and now I can definitely see why. Even reading the book gave me that magical happy feeling, just as the movies did. Honestly, I actually think I enjoyed the book more than the movie, and that is saying something because I LOVE the movie. The book provided more insight, and depth into the characters and more story than the movie ever did. I am excited to continue reading this series. Fantastic read! :)
