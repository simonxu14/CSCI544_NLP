Bought this when it first came out (guaranteed to be delivered the day it was released - and it was).  When I received it, I closed the garage, shut the curtains and blinds, and read the book (it was released on a Saturday).  And I was ready to discuss it with some of my friends on Monday.<br /><br />Now, please realize, that my friends and myself are in our 50s and retired from the military - so we aren't some kids who like reading.  No, we are even better - we are adults, who like reading and then discussing the book like a bunch of literate kids.<br /><br />What a wonderful, great, series of books as it follows Harry as he grows and faces all those adventures.<br /><br />I first started reading Harry Potter when I was a 4th grade teacher.  I left teaching shortly after the first book was released, but that did not diminish my admiration for a well written story and the new books were always bought the day of release.  As I said above, I now work with a group of people, my age, that appreciate how well these books were written.<br /><br />Too bad the movies (as good as they are, and yes, I have all of them too) couldn't follow the books - but then, the movies would be days long.
