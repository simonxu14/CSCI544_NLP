Like the other books in the series Harry Potter  and the Deathly Hallows is another prove of the amazing imagination that author possess. This book has everything you expect and more, it has action, drama, friendship, love, life and death. I'm strongly recommend the whole series as a must read for children, teens and everyone who is interested in the amazing universe created by J.K. Rowling, and if you are like me learning english in your adulthood I think is a nice way to introduce yourself to english literature, because of its easy reading structure.
