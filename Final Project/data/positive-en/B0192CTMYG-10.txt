We gave this to our 9 year old to keep her reading during the summer and she started it on day 1 of our 2 week family vacation. Well, by day 5 we were already at the local barnes and nobles picking up the second book. She absolutely loved it and it's a more challenging book that what she had been reading previously. This was the very beginning of June, and now by the end of July, she's already finished the second and third and is half way through the 4th book. As adults we've seen the movies and followed the movement, but she is our oldest child, so we'd never seen how much the books draw in their readers. We're super impressed, obviously, believe the hype, these are great books. Her imagination has been unlocked and she's teaching her younger sisters how to read to appreciate Harry Potter too!
