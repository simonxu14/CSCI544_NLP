****!!!Spoiler Alert!!!**** On my first read, I never expected/suspected poor Jenny. However, upon my second read, her emotional, and at times terrified,  reactions makes way more sense.<br /><br />That Riddle turns out to be the Dark Lord is deliciously surprising the first read and just as surprisingly satisfying the time go.<br /><br />The only thing that bothered me was that the Sword of Gryffindor just appeared all of a sudden in the sorting hat, which was otherwise useless. That was just a bit too easy.<br /><br />All in all a wonderful book.
