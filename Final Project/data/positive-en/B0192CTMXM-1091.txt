The final installment of the Harry Potter series has been absolutely the best one of all. I just could not put it down and I had to keep reading it because I needed to know what was coming next. I have not finished it yet because I just don't want it to end. I still have about four chapters plus the epilogue left to read and it has been difficult for me to start again because I know the next time I pick it up it will all be over. For anyone who has not read these books yet I highly recommend them.
