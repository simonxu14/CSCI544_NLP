As always, this book was a page turner.  Whether it is because of the attachment to the characters and knowing this is the last book, or because the story is compelling is difficult to say.  The book is very entertaining, however, I will say that, while I give it 4 stars, it fell short of expectations, and short of Book 6.  While filed with action, Book 7 doesn't command the emotional committment that Book 6 evoked.  I won't put in any spoilers, but I wil have to say that the ending fell far short of Book 6's ending.<br /><br />Still, a great read.
