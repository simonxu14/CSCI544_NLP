There's more in stock for Harry Potter this year than the usual wands, broomsticks, and magic.  This year Harry faces a new callenge in the form  of a Triwizard Tournament.  He has often dreamed of becoming a champion of  Hogwarts School of Wichcraft and Wizardry.  This year, the opportunity may  very well come to him!  From Triwizard Tournaments to even You-Know-Who,  this is a wonderful book, that contains tails of mysteries, adventure, and  lots of fun.  It's a creative and inspiring novel by J.K. Rowling.  I loved  reading it and the rest of the series, nor can I wait to read the next in  line.  Until that time, I recommend: Circle of magic by Tampra Pierce The  Book of Three, The Black Coldran, The Castle of Llyar, Taran Wanderer and  The High King all by Lloyd Alexander
