So, you have fallen hard for Pokemon Go and you want to educate yourself in order to get an edge in collecting Pokemon and dominating at gyms.<br /><br />This isn't really the book for you. It will not help you play Pokemon Go better, but it will make you smarter about Pokemon. And that can help.<br /><br />It will help you understand the Pokemon you are hunting...their type (which can help a bit at the gyms), their attacks (which do not all necessarily appear during battles) and their evolutions (which will matter when deciding which way you want to evolve, say, Evee). You have to choose to invest your Poke-candies and Stardust wisely and having a solid foundation of Pokemon knowledge, DOES help with that. Of course researching the internet for tips and tricks will help to!<br /><br />As for this book, it lists EVERY blessed Pokemon ever at the date of publication. Far more Pokemon than appear to be CURRENTLY encounterable in the game. In fact, as far as I have observed (this is coming from a level 9 Mom trainer one week into the game who was steeped in Pokemon back in '99-02 while a nanny to young boys) the Pokemon you are dealing with are the ORIGINAL Pokemon from Kanto. I was still clinging to Poke-awareness when the Johtu league emerged, but I haven't come across any of those at all, nor any from the other regions listed in this book.<br /><br />So as you read, initially focus on the KANTO region Pokemon (region listed in a circle by each name). The number of slots in my current Pokedex align with this conclusion.<br /><br />I bought TWO of these books so my 9yo and 6yo could sit side by side and read/research. They kept asking me what evolves into what and what each thing could do and what type was what, and while I was once a walking poke-pedia of knowledge, 15 years of non-use has left many holes.<br /><br />So this should be your expectation from this book. Truly an informational guide about Pokemon rather than any kind of explicit how-to guide for Go.<br /><br />Still worth the $8, especially if they expand the Pokedex, which I imagine they will.
