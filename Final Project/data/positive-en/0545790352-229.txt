Wonderful book! Pages are great quality and pictures are beautiful!! The picture go wonderfully with the story and have a great flow on where they are placed in the story. I love reading this to my child. He very much enjoys looking at all the pictures while I read to him.<br /><br />Highly recommended to get! Makes the harry potter experience even better!!
