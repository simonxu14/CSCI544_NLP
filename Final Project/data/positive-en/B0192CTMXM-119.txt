"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" - Book - Fantasy Epic<br /><br />Final Grade: 9.75/10<br /><br />Plot: 9.25/10<br /><br /> Ladies and Gentlemen, the long awaited and vastly and incredibly marketed seventh book of the Harry Potter series is here.  And boy, does J.K know how to make an entrance.  As veterans of the series can attest, this book series has been one in which the reader grows up with Harry.  The first book may have been a mostly light-hearted tale with a taste of good verses evil in its pages, but each book progressively got darker, more complex, and more adult.  The child reading book 1 will inevitably not be the same child by book 7.  Just like real life, we come to find out that not everything is perfect.  Not everything is happy.  People die.  Accidents happen.  Friendships are tested, and people you think the world of aren't always as saintly as we believe them to be.  For all the magic of the world of Harry Potter, it is ultimately the very real emotions and relationships and characters that make this such an incredible book series.<br /><br />(...)<br /><br /> There are some hiccups along the way, as some of the narrative leaves some plot points unanswered, or occasionally even worse, underwhelmingly answered.  The other major complaints, that of the high, and as some have said, unnecessary, body-count and the very gloomy attitude of the middle chapters are all still very appropriate for the subject matter, that of a very destructive, very real war.<br /> But other than those little hiccups, the plot smoothly accomplishes what it meant to do, and builds to a climax that is as massive and awe-inspiring as any I have ever read.  The book series may be over, but it's magic is the kind that lasts long afterward.  This is one of those few that demand to be read over and over again.<br /><br />Characters: 10/10<br /><br /> There isn't a single character, aside from perhaps a few of the Death Eaters that don't have very deep and complicated psychology and emotion. They could all be living breathing people.  From the very complicated characters of Harry, Snape and Voldermort, to further breaking down the barriers of what we think we know about Dumbledore, Kreatcher and so many more, everyone is more than the mere cardboard cutouts they might have appeared to be at times in book 1.<br /><br />Creativity: 10/10<br /><br /> I consider myself a rather creative individual, but Rowling must have an imagination the size and bounds of which I could only guess at.  How she could not only create one of the most colorful and dazzling, wild and wacky, worlds ever to exist in fiction, but then to give it a scope, breadth and depth that equals the best of any genre is truly an astounding feat.<br /><br />Writing Style: 10/10<br /><br /> Rowling's style has grown with the author and what started out distinct and unique has only gotten more so.  While her writing is imminently readable and simple, it also remains entirely her own.  Any given paragraph could be taken out of context and still be identifiable as her style.  And it's a style that I love to come back to.<br /><br />Writing Skill: 9.50/10<br /><br /> As her style has matured, so has her skill in weaving a tale.  As is usual with most book series, the first book is the least skilfully made, eventually ending up a very skillful finishing book.  The fact that she leaves some plot threads dangling after promising their return is a bit unpleasant, but it is hardly anything to mar the rest of the very enjoyable book, in which she has certainly matured her skill to a high degree.<br /><br />The Magic Touch:<br /><br /> While we see and become involved in what may be initially interpreted as as simple battle of Good verses Evil, we eventually see the complexity and hazy gray that real life so often thrusts our way.  The battle between Good and Evil is still there, and still the focus of everything we've come to know, and Love and Hate are still the monumental center points of conflict, but we see the humanity in the most vile characters, as well as the kindest.  Book 7 is a much darker book, a much scarier book and a much more mature book than any of the others.  Yet it is just as much more magical, uplifting and insightful for all of that.  There is a magic in this story that is found in the depths of every heart, and that is why I believe this story will stand the test of time as one of the truly great epic fantasies anyone has ever written.<br /><br />Repeat of Final Grade: 9.75/10
