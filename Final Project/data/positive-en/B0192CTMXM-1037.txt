The CD version of the book is excellently done.  Jim Dale adds a dimension to J K Rowling's work that makes it even more enjoyable than simply reading it can bring.  Dale is talented and seems to have endless voices for all of the different characters he portrays as he reads.  I will miss not having future editions of Harry Potter!  It ended all too soon and left some characters and subplots unexplored and unexplained, in my opinion.  But overall, I say it is an excellent body of work that has a timeless quality, so I can continue to enjoy it over and over.
