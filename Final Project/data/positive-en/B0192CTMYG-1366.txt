It's not the characters or the plot that makes this fabulously entertaining, it's the genius of J.K. Rowling.<br />She is extremely funny (her sense of humor really shines in the later installments) and has an incredible imagination. Her writing is masterful. She weaves a very light, funny, and engaging story.<br />Her characters are lovable, the settings are extraordinary (you'll want to jump right into the book and walk alongside Harry) and the ending leaves you breathless and panting for more.<br />This is not your typical &quot;good guy vs. bad guy&quot; plot in kiddie book form. This is J.K. Rowling's world. Young and old, male and female, doesn't matter. She has a universal audience.<br />I loved this book so much that I going to splurge on a collector's edition for myself. It's THAT good.<br />Mark my words, YOU WILL BE HOOKED TOO!<br />Cris<br />P.S. Pick up the tapes and read along. You'll have a double dose of pleasure and Jim Dale is terrific with the voices.
