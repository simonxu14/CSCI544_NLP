I was pretty pleased with the way the series ended.  I was completely hooked throughout the book and I liked that many questions I had were answered, but that the author left some things to the imagination.  If everything had been tied up too neatly I don't think it would have been as good a book.  My only compliant is that some parts were a little cheesy to me, but I could easily get lost in the story so it wasn't that big of a deal to me.
