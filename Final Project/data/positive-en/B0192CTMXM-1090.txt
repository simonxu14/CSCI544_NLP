HP 7 is excellent.  It lived up to every bit of hype laid out before it, and then some.  It is darker than any of the other books.  From the very first chapter to the last, it's a bit of an emotional roller coaster.  But by the end there is resolution to the story and as a reader, you are quite satisfied.  (Well, complete satisfaction would be never having to put the books down, but we all know we get greedy and finish them as quickly as we get them!)<br /><br />Enjoy the Deathly Hollows!  I certainly did!
