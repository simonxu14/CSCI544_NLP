This book may have been written for children but it should be read by everyone.  People have lost the capability to use their imaginations.  The Harry Potter books take you away from the chaos of real life temporarily and draw you into a world of unforgettable fantasy.  Deathly Hallows is a page turner that grabs you from the start.  Highly recommend for all age groups.  I'm sadden to hear it's Rowling's last Harry Potter book.  It would be nice to expand this story into the character's adult-hood.  Hopefully, Ms. Rowling's will consider it.
