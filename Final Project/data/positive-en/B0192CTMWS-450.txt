Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix has blown me away! It took me a while to read it all, but it was worth it. I have now read books 1-5 of the Harry Potter series, and all of them are great, but I have to say this one is one of my favorites. If you are new to the series, I suggest you start with book #1 (The Sorcerer's Stone) and work your way through the wonderful, magical world of Harry Potter.
