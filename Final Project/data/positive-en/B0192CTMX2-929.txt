I love these books!  Rowling does quite a good job developing characters with her writing style.  And her writing style and vivid imagery is why I keep going back and while I'll eagerly await the next book<br />HOWEVER, with 150 of 870 pages left to read, I started wonder how she was going to wrap things up that quickly when she hadn't even presented the real crux of the conflict yet.  I braced myself for the let-down to come.  Did she just get tired of writing it?  Was the publisher impatient for her to be done?  Did they just truncate at the page count for marketing considerations?  If that was the case, they could have done with less "Harry waits for news" at the begining and more meat at the end.<br />Nevertheless, I enjoyed the story.
