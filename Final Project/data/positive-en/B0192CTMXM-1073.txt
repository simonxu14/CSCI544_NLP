Note - no spoilers here. I sped through this in two days because I was afraid someone would tell me key plot points and how it ends. It's very good. Many of the reviews talk about unevenness - I see their point, but I really really enjoyed the book from start to finish. ... and it made me want to rush right out and reread all of the books again.  Thoroughly enjoyable. If you haven't picked up this series before, DO! You won't be dissapointed.
