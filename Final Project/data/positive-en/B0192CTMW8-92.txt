I've been a Harry Potter fan since I was 6 I'm now 17 but sadly I never really read the books fully. Till now I'm having a blast boy was I missing out. The movies really don't do justice to how great this books are. I'm currently on year 3 I can't wait for it to arrive. I'm glad I decided to finish all the books I'm having a blast! I recommended reading the book then watching the movies as you go along.
