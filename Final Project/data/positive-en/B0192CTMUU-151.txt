At the end of this book...well, can't do that, can I? The previous three books set the tone of the series, introduced you to the wizarding world, and introduced you to the main characters.  This book, the fourth in a series of seven intended books, is the book where the conflict begins.  It is this book that shows you that this series has a real villain and a really villainous villain at that.<br /><br />We are introduced to whole other aspects of the wizarding world: new schools, other cultures, ancient traditions, and we're shown what happens when kids start growing up.<br /><br />The tiniest beginnings of a spark between Hermione and Ron begin to show.  Harry proves he's adolescent as well.<br /><br />The whole story, from World Quidditch Cup beginning to end-of-TriWizard-Tournament ending is a pulsing, pounding story.  I had trouble setting it down.  I've read it numerous times (I'm over 30....).<br /><br />This series, and this book in particular, are perfectly toned for both adult and child (and tweeners, too.). I was actually startled to find the book is listed and stored in the juvenile section of my local bookstore.  Appalled, really.  I'm reading a kids' book?  Oh, well.  It's that good.  By the way, Grapes of Wrath is in the Juvenile section of my library, too, and I hardly think anyone would call that kiddie lit.<br /><br />Before you read this book, you ought to read the first three.  This is a great book, but too far gone in the wizarding world for first time Potter readers.
