I've read the first 4 Harry Potter books at this point, and while this one would not be ranked as my favorite, it still is well worth 5 stars. Certainly you need to read this before continuing on to books 3 and 4! But this book did not have quite the novelty of the first book, the wonderful characters of the third, or the great plot developments of the fourth. It just sort of falls between all of them on these counts, giving us an interesting plot, further development of the main characters and a few things we will see again in later books. But the book is still certainly engrossing and a fun read, and highly recommended.
