As with all Harry Potter books, this one as amazing. HP7 satisfied me until the end, and it did not disappoint me. Rowling however does leave many questions left unanswered. Some apparent grammar mistakes near the end also left a slight bitter taste in my mouth, but overall it was highly enjoyable.<br />Although if you've been reading Harry Potter, I doubt that any of these reviews will actually change your mind.
