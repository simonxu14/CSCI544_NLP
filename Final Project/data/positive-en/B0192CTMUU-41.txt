&quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; is not only as riveting as the first three books, but it considerably expands and deepens the trajectory of this series:  good versus evil. But the evil is not only  supernatural; it's also clearly becoming identified with the  attitudes of  those who believe that Muggles are a corrupting force and an abomination in  the wizarding world. And although it's done with some humor, there's an  interesting subplot about house elves and slavery (remember Dobby?) It also  develops the characters further, some unexpectedly; for example, Albus  Dumbledore, Severus Snape and even Hagrid. And though one of the characters  dies (I'm not going to spoil it by telling), Rowling's humor remains  intact. The conflicts between Harry and Ron, and Ron and Hermione, are  particularly well executed; and the reader never forgets that the three  main young characters are kids (and ones now coping with puberty), even if  they can perform magic.  Rowling includes the blind alleys and red herrings  she excels at creating, which provide their usual suspense. As Rowling has  said, this is the pivotal book, and she's pulled it off again.
