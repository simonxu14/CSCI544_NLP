Everyone (children and adults) loves a great "good vs. evil" story.  I often think that something that everyone raves about just can't be as good as the say, but Harry Potter exceeds the reviews.<br /><br />If you thought that the first three or all four were too much of children's books, give Phoenix a try.  This book is darker that the others.<br /><br />The incredibly rich detail in all the Harry Potter novels is really the best aspect of the story.  JKR creates a whole world that readers can't forget about.  There many subplots, but JKR keeps them all straight.<br /><br />I can't tell you how great all the books in this series are, you'll have to read them for yourself.  Harry Potter is the new Star Wars, the new Lord of the Rings.  It already is a legend.
