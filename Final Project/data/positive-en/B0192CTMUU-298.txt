When I though It coulnd't get any better and then I get the Goblet of Fire and its interesting story, suspense and darker trama. If you've seen the movie you should really read this book since you are missing some of the best parts... I give this book 5 stars because it deserves it, it is a great book with a deep story, a story that it certainly does not end here and leaves you wondering whast going to happen next
