JK Rowling delivered more than what was expected. The book was a fitting finale to this well-loved and popular series. The only thing that is disappointing is that this is the last book of the series, no more looking forward for the next book (that was half of the fun, the anticipation!). I hope she'll be back soon with new books, she really is a great author.
