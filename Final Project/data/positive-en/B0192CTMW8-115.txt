I have been reading the Harry potter series and I think that this is the best series I have ever read.My friend also likes Harry potter a lot.<br />His brother also likes Harry potter.My favorite part was when Harry potter found the chamber of secrets then, Harry fought the basalik and killed the memory of Lord Voldemort.
