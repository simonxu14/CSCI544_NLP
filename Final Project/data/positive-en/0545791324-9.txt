This is for our 3-grade grandson.  We gave him The Sorcerers Stone to him in  July for his birthday.  He read it in 4 days.  He is hopefully awaiting the next installment which he will receive for Christmas.  The book is beautifully illustrated, just perfect for a young reader. New look forward to adding the books to his beginning collection as the new books are produced.  Since wevhavevall read the Harry Potter series, our grandson enjoyed asking questions for clarification and discussing the why or how of the characters.<br />If you have a reader who wants to dig into some outstanding reads with beautiful illustrations, this is the book for you!
