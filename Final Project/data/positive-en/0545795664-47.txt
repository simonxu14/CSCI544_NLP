Great book!!! My son saw this book at the school book fair and it easy bit pricy there.  I found it on Amazon at a much better price and ordered it.  My 7 yr old son loves it so much and never gets tired of it.  He loves to share it with his friends at school.  I would highly recommend it to anyone with young kids.
