What do you need to say about Harry Potter books that hasn't already been said? However, my thoughts, this book is the first one that starts to get a little &#34;dark&#34; at the end. So if you have a younger child reading the book, and you know nothing about the Harry Potter series, you might want to read it so you know whether it's appropriate for your child. However, having said that, Goblet of Fire is a page turner, continuing to develop the characters and is an awesome continuation of the series.
