Harry and the others are growing up, and so is JK Rowling, I think. The writing is more complex, the storyline, more complicated and I couldn't put the book down! As a 26-year old "kid" reading the books, I love seeing Harry and the gang muddle through finals and studies and friendships and crushes, all the while fighting evil. Truly a great read for any age!
