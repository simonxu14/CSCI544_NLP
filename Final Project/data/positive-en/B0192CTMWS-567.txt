I was afraid when I picked this book up and started to read it that when it ended I would feel like I wanted more. I could not believe that when I finished it that the series was so full circle and complete. Everything tied together and left me feeling fulfilled! I love her writing style and how thorough and complete she is with her characters and story lines.
