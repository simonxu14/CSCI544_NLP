I am stationed in South Korea with my husband and we don't have the luxuries of a book store close to us so we have to resort to online purchases. Usually we get things about 6 weeks after we order them, but it was not the case here. I placed my order and in less than 2 weeks the package was here. I'm very happy with the product as well. I'm happy that they are paperback and that I can complete my set now. Love the books and just happy all around.
