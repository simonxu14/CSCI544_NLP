This is my grand daughters favorite Harry Potter book and besides that the reason I wanted it was for a very talented art and crafter I know makes beautiful bracelets out of books and adds colorful beads to complete the work of art.. So I had it send directly to her.  They turned out beautiful and to surprise me she also made a flower out of the cover attached to an old bed spring.  So creative!  I just have to put it in a vase with a little rice to hold it and present it.  My granddaughter will have a beautiful flower and bracelet to remember her favorite book ... and grandmother...LOL!
