Harry Potter is growing up, and this book reflects that. The dangers are more threatening, the laughs more infrequent. I found the book to be the best yet, but parents should prepare young children who want to read this  book.<br />I don't want to say much about the story and give anything away to  those waiting to read it. We do learn that there are three European schools  of wizardry, Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. Each puts up a champion  for the Triwizard Tournament, which ties together what happens in Harry's  fourth year. We meet Fleur Delacour from Beauxbatons and Viktor Krum from  Durmstrang, characters who will hopefully reappear in books 5-7. As the  years have gone on, the skirmishes between Harry and Lord Voldemort have  gotten more intense, and Goblet of Fire doesn't disappoint. When everything  is done you'll know why the last chapter is called &quot;The  Beginning&quot;.
