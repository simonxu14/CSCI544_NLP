I am a nerd and I love this series.  Books DVDs and audiobooks.  Most people need just 1 format.<br />I actually prefer the audio books because 1. they take up less space, 2. i can &#34;read&#34; with my eyes closed (laying by the pool or on the beach for ex.) or doing some dreary task.  However I just like looking at the books on the shelf.  Maybe I will feel like turning actual pages.
