Wow, all I can say is Jim Dale really brings J.K. Rowling's text to life. So much so I purchased every one of the series because he narrates all of them for Listening Library. These are by far the best audio book narrations I have listened to (and I travel a good deal so I listen to allot). If you are familiar with the series, you know the large volume of characters residing in the HP universe, all of which he reads in a unique voice and inflection. Superb!
