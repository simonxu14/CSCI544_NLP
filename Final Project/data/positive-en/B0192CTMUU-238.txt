Beyond excellant, this book is completely enchanting. From the moment I picked it up to the moment I finished it, I was gripping the edge of my seat, reading faster and faster in an attempt to discover what happens.  Never has a Harry Potter book been this thrilling, and I am a big fan of  the first three books, so you know that is not an unfounded statement. Kids  AND adults I know have been begging me to let them read parts of the book:  they are all impatiently awaiting the arrival of their own copy. I can't  remember the last time I was so deeply entrenched in a series: I am already  going crazy with anticipation for the next book. If possible, I would give  this book a 10-star review.
