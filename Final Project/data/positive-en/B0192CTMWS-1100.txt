I admit when I first started the book, I still liked Half-blood Prince better.  As I read I found that I could not stop reading.  This book by far exceeded any expectation I had.  It was written well and answered the questions that were raised throughout the whole series.  The last 3 chapters were worth the price of the book.  With the exception of the Lord of the Rings, this book brought closure to the end that we rarely see in literature these days.  Buy it...the book is fantastic!
