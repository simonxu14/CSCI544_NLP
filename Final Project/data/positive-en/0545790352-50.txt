This book is BEAUTIFUL! I love the artwork, absolutely love it. I got a copy for myself, but my 7 year old nephew has told me he likes Harry Potter, so I've gotten this version for him for Christmas as he's still at the age where he likes to look at pictures as he reads stories. The original pictureless novels that we all love are &#34;too boring&#34; for him at this stage, but even so, this book is the full story. It hasn't been shortened in any way shape or form with nearly every page illustrated in gorgeous detail that brings the magic of Harry's world to life.<br /><br />Also, has anybody noticed the Deathly Hallows symbol in the iron work on page 58??
