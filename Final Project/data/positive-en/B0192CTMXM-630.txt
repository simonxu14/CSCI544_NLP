Wow! What can I say but "wow"! "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" is fantastic! The book is 870 pages, 37 chapters, and has a whole lot of plot! In this 5th year at Horgoward, unlike other previous years, Harry Potter is a 15 year-old teenager. Some of the readers may find it disturbing to find out what he is doing at the year of 15. The transition between a kid and a man sure is painful and J.K.Rowling sure know how to describe it. You will find Harry Potter has more temper than before. His anger is exploded so many times in some first chapters and as the result, he gets so many detentions that I do not bother to count. Also in the story, Professor Dumbledor is removed and another professor with a personality like that of a snake takes his place. And that lady sure knows how to make Harry's life difficult. There are some surprises like Ron becomes Griffindor's prefect and keeper and Ginny has a boyfriend. The end of the story is very sad: the only person that Harry considers as a father and a brother dies (I'm not going to tell you his name, it's better for you to find out by yourself). Harry defeats the Dark Lord (again, as usual) and this time with the help of all his best friends and the people from D.A. To me, reading the 5th book of Harry Potter is like riding a roller-coaster: it takes me from thrills to thrills. Once you read the first page, you can't help reading the whole book.
