You know what? This was a really great story - not just this book, but the entire series/story as a whole.  I just finished it, and I can't imagine a better way to end it.  Before you read this, think about truthfully how you would most like to have it end - read it - is it really much different?  Before beginning the book, I read all of the negative reviews (not the + ones) - and never once did the negative reviewer's words echo in my head as I read this novel.  It was really wonderful and more than anything I feel sad that there isn't the next Harry Potter book to wait for.  Great ending!  Thank you!
