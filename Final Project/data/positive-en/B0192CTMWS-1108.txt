I have just finished reading the 7th book and I think is the one I liked best. I don't give it 5 stars because I was kind of lost most of the book. I didn't know how it was to end at all and that is a good thing, but for some time i thought the story was wandering through the pages, telling and describing things that were no necessary. I think the book it's alittle oversized because of that. But it's a great book that you can't stop reading till it's done. A really good ending.
