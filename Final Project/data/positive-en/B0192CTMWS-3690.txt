Ms. Rowling sustained the high quality of storytelling and writing style throughout the final book. She did a great job mixing the fast-paced, must-read sections with the mellower, time-for-chores parts. We look forward to reading these books to our children when they are ready. This is a wonderful series from beginning to end, with a nice closing.
