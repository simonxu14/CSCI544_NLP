Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a Magical, charming, entertaining and wonderful book!<br />The lessons in this book are constant. The connection to God is evident,the battle between Good and Evil are ever present.<br />The writing is rich and colorful, you can actually see the way the castle looks and feels, the creatures are described so vividly you can imagine them perfectly, you can even smell the smells and actually feel propelled into Hogwarts Castle. The magic in the story is like the icing on the cake!<br />I am a HUGE fan of these books,and I recommend them highly to people of all ages.
