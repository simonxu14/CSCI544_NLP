It was worth the wait.  Despite misgivings because of the ending of book six, I dove into book seven with ravenous hunger.  To my delight, Ms. Rowling told an exceptional story.  Loose ends were neatly tied off and the pages seemed to turn themselves as if I were in the library at Hogwarts.  A must must read, even if you reviled the name of J.K. Rowling after book sis.  She's acquited herself very nicely indeed.
