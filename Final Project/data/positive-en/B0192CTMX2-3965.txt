I ordered this book as a gift so I did not read it myself but I was told it was wonderful (as to be expected from Harry Potter).  The book was delivered just as promised promptly on the release date in excellent condition.  It also came in a wonderful shipping box with creative Harry Potter sayings.  I pre-ordered it so it was the BEST deal with super saver shipping and a $5 off coupon.  I was very happy to have purchased it through Amazon.
