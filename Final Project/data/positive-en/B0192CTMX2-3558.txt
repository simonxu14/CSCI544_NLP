Many things were answered in the final book. This is truly a fitting ending for a great story. J.K. Rowling has a true gift that she has shared with the world.<br /><br />After much speculation, the world finally knows the 'truth'. After going back and rereading the first few books, it becomes apparent that parts of the story were beginning to take shape even from the start. Most people have a difficult time writing even one book, but to write seven and not stray off topic, is absolutely amazing.
