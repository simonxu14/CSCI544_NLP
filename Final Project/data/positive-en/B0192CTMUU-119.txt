Oh, joy! Once read, to read and read again, finding layers anddetails and delights missed in the first delighted consumption! Don'tread reviews! Go up the page! Read the book! Don't wait! (unless you have missed Harry 1, 2,3 ... then forwith to them!)<br />How anyone, anywhere sees these books as anything less than delightful, innocent and endearing is a crime against reason.  Down with the forces of darkness! Go forth and read!
