This illustrated edition is fantastic. I can't say enough about how well put together this edition is. Any Potterhead would be thrilled with this book. The pages seem to come alive with the story and bring out details the movies didn't cover. It's a great way to involve kids that are still too young to read the series on their own in the story.
