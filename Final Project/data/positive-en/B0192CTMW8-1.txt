Want to end the TV addiction in your family?  Get a copy of the audio versions of the Harry Potter books and you'll never know what hit you!<br />Every kid who drives in our car wants to move to our house!  My  daughter and I have been listening to the first and second Harry Potter  books (Sorceror's Stone and Chamber of Secrets) on both audiotape and CD  for weeks and weeks now.  By that, I mean, that once we finish one, we put  the other one on, and have continued to go back and forth at her request.<br />I don't know how long this can last, but I agree that nothing else quite  measures up afterwards!  The reader, Jim Dale, is somehow able to  communicate at least one or two DOZEN characters without any duplication  and perfectly captures the style and personality of each of the characters  without any loss of how you imagine them.  What a treat!<br />Each character  has a perfectly appropriate voice and tone and loses absolutely nothing  from the book.  Quite the contrary, we are both hearing new things that we  must have missed the first time we read the books as we are endlessly  entertained and amused.<br />We listen whenever we are driving in the car, or  drawing or doing crafts, while laughing out loud, crying, and giving each  other funny looks!<br />We have even found ourselves sitting outside the  movies, lessons, and our own driveway, without being able to move until we  come to the end of a chapter.<br />No matter how many times you have read the  books, I guarantee the audio versions will give you a new perspective on  the stories and/or reveal something which you didn't already know from your  reading.  Besides, it is a pleasure separate and apart from reading the  books yourself.  The art of reading out loud is not entirely lost--you only  have to listen to these audiotapes to realize that the TV can never compete  with this type of reading out loud!  Share this with your family--YOU'LL  NEVER LOOK BACK!
