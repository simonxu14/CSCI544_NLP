I am a junior in high school and read the first Harry Potter book at the request of a relative.  I was immediately entralled by the book's mesmerizing story.  Unlike many of the books I read now for school, and even for my own enjoyment, Harry Potter was light and a delicious treat for  my reading senses.  Each book is better than the last, daring the reader to  enter Harry Potter's world.  I was almost overwhelmed by the size of The  Goblet of Fire, but found it to be a book I could not put down.  This book  can be an enjoyment for any age as something incredibly fresh and exciting.  I give it my highest reccomendation.
