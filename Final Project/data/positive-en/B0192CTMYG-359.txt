I originally bought this book for myself.  I read it in less than 24 hours, and sat down to order the 2nd and 3rd books.  I then started reading a chapter each night to my 6 1/2 year old son.  By the third chapter, my  husband was joining us each evening, and now the whole family is hooked on  this book.  We look forward to &quot;visiting&quot; Harry each night.  My  son, in fact, loves the book so much he's decided to be Harry for  Halloween.  In all, this book is one of the most interesting we've read.  I think the Harry Potter series will be a favorite in our home for years to  come.
