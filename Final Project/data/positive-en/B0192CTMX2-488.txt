The Harry Potter series is a fun read for me.  I never read them when they were first published because I had too much adult literature to read. I began reading them when my great grandson, with whom I read over Skype  or the phone every night, decided he wanted to read them. The series changed my reading buddy  from a reluctant reader into one who often reads ahead of where we stopped the night before.<br />The series works for readers from about 10 years old to any age who enjoys the fantasy production of a brillant writer.
