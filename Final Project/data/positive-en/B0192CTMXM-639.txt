I was happily anticipating the release of Book 5, being a fan of the series but not one of the die-hard ones who go into B&N at midnight to pick up a copy.  Figured I'd read it on the train, give myself a couple of weeks.  HA.  I ended up finishing it during a short car trip, squinting and trying to use the streetlamps to illuminate the page, as it was after dark.  SO much for making a good thing last.  This is probably my favorite one, yet, though it is difficult to say that as each book relies so heavily on the stories of the past - I can only safely say that the story itself has reached impressive new heights in the fifth installment.  The story, as everyone swears, is much darker - I was worried after the first 200 pages that we'd be tortured without relief for 900 pages, but Ms. Rowling did a superb job, lightening the mood when we needed it most.  My highest praise goes to the author's work on her minor characters.  I was positively delighted with the development of so many characters, including Neville, McGonagall, Sirius, Lupin and Snape.  I do have to include one disappointment - I laughed, sighed, and gasped aloud, but when the book should have been at its saddest, I didn't find myself crying.  Something about the unfolding of the story didn't strike me severely enough - and I cry quite easily.  I'm sure there will be more opportunities for that in the future.
