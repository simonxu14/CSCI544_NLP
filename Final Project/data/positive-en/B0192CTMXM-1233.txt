I know that alot of people may have had problems with Book 5 but there is something intriguing about how it shows a march into darker times.  There is something very haunting about Moody showing Harry a picture of The Order of the Pheonix when his parents were members.  Still it's an excellent installment that I'm sure will lead to a wonderful payoff in the future.
