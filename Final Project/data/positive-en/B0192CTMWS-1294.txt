Great Book!! This is by far the best of the series. It is well written and sums up the series well. i hope Rowling keeps writing it would be ashame if she stops. I would put this book up there with some of the greats of fantasy like Stephen King's "the stand" and C.S. lewis's "Narania" (spelling) series.
