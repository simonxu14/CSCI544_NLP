Though the first 400 pages are a little wordy, they were really a necessary set-up for the second half of the book.  And boy did things really pick up then.  Ms. Rowling (don't know her new married name) has manage to get inside of the mind of Harry and his psyche is now an open window to us- much more open than ever before.  She has developed some really great story lines for the next two books and I really can't wait to purchase those.  I hope the next one doesn't take as long to get written published and distributed although I do understand the writing process is not always easy.  I started reading Saturday evening and once I reached that 400-page benchmark, I was not able to put the book down until nearly 4am Monday morning knowing I had to be to work at 8:30am!  Great book!  Good Job Ms. Rowling!  Keep in mind though, that there are some heavy subjects in this book, more than in the 4th one w/ Cedric's death so please use parental discretion.
