Stunning doesn't begin to cover it. This book is BIG and BEAUTIFUL. It's much larger than I expected, very much a storybook. I am an avid Harry Potter fan and own around 60 copies of the books, this one outshines them all, by MILES. I love Mary GrandPr&eacute;'s renderings, but what Jim Kay has done here is, for lack of a better word, magical.<br /><br />I have gone through this book about 10 times in the 24 hours I've owned it. It has made me smile, giggle, and a little teary. Jim Kay has cast a spell and the result is perfection.<br /><br />If you are a Potter fan, buy this book. Today. You will NOT regret it.<br /><br />If you have small children, buy this book. Today. It is a gorgeous way to introduce children to the series.<br /><br />If you have never read Potter before, buy this book. Today. The story will draw you in, but these illustrations make it shine.<br /><br />Buy this book. Today.<br /><br />Also, Jim's dedication at the front of the book has charmed me and left me wanting to know more. &lt;3
