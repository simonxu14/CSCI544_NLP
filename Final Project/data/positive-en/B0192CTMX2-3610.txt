Sorry to see it happen but the Potter saga comes to an end.  While at time the final book seemed to drag on a bit over all it is a very fitting conclusion for Harry, Hermione, Ron and all of the rest of the vast cast that has kept us enchanted for the last several years.  I just wish the movies could be as good as the books but until we go to 6 hour movies I don't see that happening.  Well done and an excellan read.
