This was the best Potter book yet, but I said that after reading the second book, as well as the rest of them! I thought Professor Umbridge was horrible!! She made Professor Snape look like Harry's best friend! Reading should be fun, for all ages, and this was definitely a fun read. Can't wait for the next one.
