I decided to read the book to determine what all the Christian agitation was about. I am a Christian and I believe I have the gift of discernment. I found this book a GREAT read! Family values are upheld, like Ron's family,  who does not have to be rich to be happy, and abusive family systems are  ridiculed, like Harry's relatives. Good and evil are distinct in the muggle  world and in the magic world. A very entertaining series!
