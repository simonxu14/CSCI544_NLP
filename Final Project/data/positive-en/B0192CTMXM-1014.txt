As with all of Rowling's books, you are able to sit back and let out your inner child.  Simultaneously, the adult in you is satisfied by the exploration of some adult themes.  Rowling is not afraid to kill off some of the Potterites' favorite characters to add depth and reality to a world that is anythung but. This reader, however, is still sad that at this end of the Potter era. Although the book's epilogue gives snippets into the characters' futures, you are left wanting and hopeful that she or others in her style, will one day write stories flushing out the teasers at the end of the "last" book.
