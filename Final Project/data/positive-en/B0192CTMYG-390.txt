This is the beginning of the epic story of Harry Potter. It is engrossing the whole way through. I found that I did not want to put this book down. J.K. Rowling has the imagination of a 4 year old, meaning as a compliment. Her creation of characters from other worlds, items from other worlds, is astonishing. I can't wait to read the next one. Thank you for such a wonderful contribution to the literary world, J.K.
