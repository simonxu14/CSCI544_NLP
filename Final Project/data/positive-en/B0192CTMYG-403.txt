My 9 year old daughter Caitlin says, &quot;When my mom read this book to me I wasn't sure I would like it, but by the time we were finished, I was hoping for a sequel.  My favorite part was when Prof. Dumbledor ate the  yucky &quot;jelly bean&quot;.  Too funny.  Mom and I can't wait for the  next Harry book to be available on Amazon.com.  We love to read together!
