It's the whole book plus stunning illustrations by an amazing artist!  As an artist and a writer it was so worth it for me to buy this version of The Sorcerer's Stone.  It's very inspiring.  Jim Kay didn't just create images based off the movies, he used Rowling's vivid descriptions and created his own interpretations of the Harry Potter universe.  It makes reading the book that much more exciting!
