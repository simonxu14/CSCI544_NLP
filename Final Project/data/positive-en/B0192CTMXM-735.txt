The fifth book in the Harry Potter series, Order of the Phoenix, is a much darker peek into the life of our boy Wizard. Harry is a teenager now, filled to the brim with the hormones and angst common to all teenagers. Dealing with Lord Voldermort on top of all that makes him quite surly and unhappy for much of the book. I found myself not liking Harry much for long stretches of the story. That was the point, though, I think, to portray the true upheaval of puberty, the sturm and drang that is only natural to a boy of 15. It makes Harry not only a wizard and a hero, but a true-to-life portait of a misunderstood teenager.<br />The novel is fast-paced and intense. You'll find the answers to lots of questions, and as many more questions are raised. I can't honestly recommend this book for younger readers, though. The dark undercurrent running through the story may be too much for them. I did like the book very much, though. I only wish Harry had been a more likable and sympathetic character instead of wallowing in self-pity so much of the time. A solid entry in the series that makes me impatient for the next book.
