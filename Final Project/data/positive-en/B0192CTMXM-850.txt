This is one of the best series I've read in a long time about coming of age, good vs evil and what it truly means to be a friend.  It says life isn't all sweetness and light, but you don't give up or give in when things are bleak.<br /><br />If you lose someone you love, mourn them, remember them, and then get on with life.  Honor their memories but don't become a terminal victim.<br /><br />JKR did an incredible job of writing and teaching lessons without preaching, and to be able to kill off characters that were good as well as those that were bad is a mark of her character and resilience.  She also did a good job of tying together all of the threads without taking any of the edge off of the story.  I believe these books will stand the test of time.<br /><br />I have read each book at least 6 times and Deathly Hallows twice so far.  They have pride of place on my bookshelf and will for years to come.
