i absolutely loved the 7th book, but as expected somethings did not add up in retrospect.  if you can over look minor details that sway/change from one book to another, it's a great book.  i don't know how someone can write 7 books in a series and not get info mixed up more than it was.  but mistakes are minor.  i've read it 3 times now just to make things sink in better and i loved it the 3rd time just as much as i did the 1st time.<br /><br />the most disappointing part had nothing to do with the book itself.  i almost gave the book 1 star but my disappointment in Amazon is not Rowlings fault.  Amazon said they would offer the best price, which i took to mean the absolute lowest price even with shipping and handling inclueded, otherwise you're getting gypped.  i pre-ordered my book because of that.  my local wal-mart had the book cheaper, and then i would not have had to pay $2 shipping and handling, and i could have picked it up a midnight, and my wal-mart was giving away rubber, hogwarts wristbands/bracellets.  i thought, "oh, wow, this must mean Amazon is going to do the same just to keep up with the competition."  nope.  for somethings Amazon is great and i could swear by it, but i don't believe in swearing.  sometimes it's just better to shop ebay or wal-mart, and Harry Potter 7 is just one of those cases for now.
