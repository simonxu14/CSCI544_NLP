While people were standing in unbearably long lines to purchase the first copies of the newest and final "Harry Potter", a UPS truck was making its way to my Granddaughter's home with a copy that came in really cute packaging and arrived in the early morning hours before most of those people in long lines even got back home to crack open their own copies!<br />Thanks Amazon for coming through once again!!
