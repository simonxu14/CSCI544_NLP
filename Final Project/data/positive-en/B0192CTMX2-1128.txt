Book 5 was worth the wait!  It's darker, scarier, frustrating, and creepy but wonderful.  The characters are all developed more deeply and you see Harry's flaws more in this book, he's not the perfect little hero.  The return of old characters like Lupin and Rita Skeeter are welcome, and the real Mad-Eye is back too.  Don't worry, there are still enough loose ends at the end of the book to leave you hoping JKR doesn't take so long to put out Book 6!
