When we were planning our wedding, I asked my husband what he would like for a gift from me and he asked for this audio book.  He was living in Kansas City and I was living in Oklahoma City.  It is a 5.5 hour drive one way and he was coming to see me every weekend before our wedding.  I gave it to him early.
