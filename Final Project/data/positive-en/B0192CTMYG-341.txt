If you've got an imagination, these CDs are better than the movies.  You can listen to them to and from work.  Makes commuting a lot less stressful and a lot more interesting.  The Harry Potter series itself is absolutely awesome.  Struggling through good and evil, Harry Potter enchants the imagination and leaves you wondering at the mystery.  When the book is done, you'll be looking forward to the next.  I personally look forward to the opportunities I have to sit down and listen.  All of the story CDs are read by the same narrator and he does voices for the different charectors.  The CDs are done very well.  Definitely worth the extra money to get them in this format.  Even if I'd read all the books, I'd say this format is a worth while purchase.
