This book (as well as all the Harry Potter Books) has 3 things that I truly love. (1) They are very well written so that both adults and kids will enjoy.  JK Rowlings' character development is fabulous. The details of each and every setting and all actions in the plot are the best.  (2) These books have gotten some kids that NEVER would pick up a book to read, READING! Not just reading some small book so they can get a grade in school. But books that take a little time, energy, and thought into reading them. It seemed that for a while there, everywhere you turned you would find a kid with their nose in a Harry Potter Book. (3)This series of books created a community of people both kids and adults discussing books together. Reading became the popular thing to do.  When kids see and hear adults reading and talking about books, they see the importance of reading.  That is more valuable that the books themselves.
