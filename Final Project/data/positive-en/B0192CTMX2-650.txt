I did indeed enjoy this book, the fifth in the Harry Potter series. I was pleased to see a bit more character development in Harry, as mounting school and peer pressures make him both more worrisome and a bit snappish at times. He does seem a bit more introverted and questioning than in the earlier books in the series, an attitude assisted by an increasingly distant relationship with Dumbledore, clashes with Sirius, and much doubt over how to handle his blossoming relationship with Cho. This book spend less time on the Quiddich field and more time in Harry's head, making it slightly less of a fairy-tale romp into potions and spells, and more of a chronicle of a boy making his transition into adulthood.<br />I was also happy to see that this book finally shed some light into exactly why Harry was targeted by Voldemort as an infant--that's been held out as a teaser for a while, and I was starting to wonder if we were going to have to wait for the last book in the series to find out. Of course, J.K. Rowling poses as many questions as she answers in this book, and we must all now wait for several months before we get more insight into exactly how much knowledge Aunt Petunia has of the magical world, and whether or not Harry's unthinkingly reflexive use of an "unforgivable" crucio curse gives us a hint into how the plot of book six might unfold.
