Although this book was perhaps a little darker than the other three, it is a must read!  I do question whether some of this matieral is suited for young readers, but I feel that it is appropriate for teenagers and young adults.  I cannot wait to get Roland's next book, but it will be a long, long wait.<br />For those who want an idea of what this book is about.... It starts out with the World Cup Quidditch match where the sky is lit by the Dark Lord's sign.  Then, when Harry and group do to school, they find that all Quidditch matched are cancelled at Hogwarts this year because of a cometetion between three school of magic.  Harry is entered and chosen as one of the competitors (who didn't see that coming?!).  The rest of the book contains Harry and the other competitors facing thier challenges.  Harry also has personal challenges from not only Malfoy &amp; company, but also from Ron and Hermione.  I am looking forward to seeing Harry 5th year at Hogwart's.  What's next on Harry's agenda of adventures?  Roland, please hurry!  I cannot wait for Book 5, 6, and 7 to be published!!!
