J.K. Rowling didn't just finish the story of Harry Potter by simply carrying us to the end with all the secrets we longed to read.  She added new and interesting concepts to the ongoing story, as well as wonderfully intense mystery elements for a combination that makes the book more pleasing than the rest.<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the perfect ending to one of the greatest stories of our time.<br /><br />This book is magnificent because of all the solid work that went into every story, every character and every line of all seven books.  J.K. Rowling is an amazing storyteller, and I hope she continues to turn out great books in the future.
