I did not get into the Harry Potter books until recently.  I can now see why the books and movies are so popular with both teens and adults alike.  The magic world that J.K. Rowling has invented is both intoxicating and fun to be in.  I will read the rest of them up to the release of the 7th and last book.  Thank you Amazon for being able to purchase this at such a great price.
