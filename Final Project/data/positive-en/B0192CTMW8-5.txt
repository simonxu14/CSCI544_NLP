Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the second novel in the Harry Potter series. I grew up reading this series and fell in love with it. I lost a few books out of my set, and ordered the ones I was missing off amazon. My book arrived in good condition; it was a paperback copy. I purchased it used, and I was happy with the condition of the book. In this book The Chamber of Secrets gets opened and attacks start happening on the students in school. Harry, Ron, and Hermione spend the book trying to find out who is behind these attacks while attending their second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I enjoyed this book as a young adult and I enjoy it still. I don't want to give away any spoilers so I won't so too much into the summary of the book. The book is very well written, and being only 251 pages it didn't take long for me to finish. Once I started I didn't want to put it down, and thoroughly enjoyed the twists and surprises in this book. JKR is an amazing, author and person, too.
