As the mother of a precocious 9yo girl, I was amused to read in the news about parents wanting this series of books banned in schools. Being the mother that I am, that was pretty much enough to make me run right out and  buy all three books for my daughter.  I don't agree with the  parents/readers that commented that the books are much to 'violent' for  children to read. I would much rather my child read this book than watch  the evening news anyday of the week. As her parent, I thought it was my job  to discuss the world around us with her, not sheild her from it and have  her be shocked by it when she reaches adulthood.<br />I'll continue to read  each book before her to ensure that it's something I am comfortable with  her reading, because really, it should be MY choice, not the choice of a  bunch of closed-minded people.
