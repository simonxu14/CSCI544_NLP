... and if I don't give it five stars, it's mostly for that reason.<br />My Amazon copy arrived at 1:30 pm, and I finsihed reading at 1 am, having forgotten to stop for dinner until I had been reading for eight hours  straight. If the previous books hypnotized you as they did me, be sure you  have nothing on your schedule at the point you pick this one up!<br />And yet,  of course, it's not as good as the hype, but how could it be? The character  who gets killed isn't quite as significant as many had thought. All the  previous Potters had plotholes but this one's holes were major enough that  I noticed them *before* I finished reading ...<br />That being the case, so  what? If you're going to be subjected to the kind of crazed hype that  Potter is attracting, at least let it be for books as well-written as  these.
