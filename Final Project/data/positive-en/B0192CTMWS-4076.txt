On Saturday morning at 9:32 am I arose out of bed, walked down the hallway, and opened my front door.  The postman was there with my copy of Deathly Hallows.  This was an unexceptional event except for one small detail:  he had not rung the buzzer yet, and I usually sleep late on Saturdays.  On Sunday afternoon at 4:07 pm I finished reading all but the epilogue.  Tears were streaming down my face as I tried not to make any noise so that anyone would hear me.  However, these were tears of joy mingled with sorrow:  a eucatastrophe.  This is the hallmark of some of the best written works:  that joy and sorrow have become so closely joined together that they cannot be separated.  They have become one.  I'm still astonished today as I write this brief tribute.  Her completed work is a gift at any price.  I can only say "Thank you, J.K. Rowling."
