My husband and I are listening the the books together.  We both enjoy them.  The author created such a magical world and it's fun getting lost in it.  Jim Dale does a great job of bringing each character to life and giving them their own voice.  This book specifically was one of my favorite because we got to know more about Harry's parents and his bond with Professor Lupin really seems to give it a warm feel.  We Highly Recommend the whole series.
