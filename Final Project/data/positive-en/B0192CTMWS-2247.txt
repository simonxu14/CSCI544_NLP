Great series with a great ending!<br />Ms Rowling has the rare ability create a universe and characters that totally engulf the reader. Each book was an addictive personality's nightmare.<br /><br />Every time a new book came out I sat down with it in great anticipation. I would save it and savor it, clearing the everyday clutter away and snuggling into the book.<br /><br />Please tell us, Ms Rowling, that you aren't just going to rest on your bags of money (which you deserve). Tell us that there will be more books to come. I am not talking about the Harry Potter, but something! Another series, something more....please?
