j.k. rowling has brought the potter saga to a wonderful conclusion. though the story at time lumbers slowly, it does pick up steam . the characters that we have followed and lived with are given more depth and feeling and as you near the last few chapters you begin to dread the finish because you really don't want to know who will die, and you just don't want the book to end. a very satisfying epilouge that also leaves an opening for a return to the wizarding world, should rowling ever feel so inclined. this is a series that can be reread over and over, and will take it's place as a literary classic!
