At 51, and in 2009, I am a very late comer to the Harry Potter series. This is the first book of the series, and one of the best. It's a great story with the appropriate amounts of humor, mysticism, and adventure to awaken the spirits of a mature man or woman and perhaps even put some wonder back into our lives.  It was a great break from the overly serious stuff that I usually read.  I was not too happy about making J.K. Rowling even richer when I purchased the book (used), but she did create a great series. There are plenty of used copies around these days and I am sure the book is also readily available in the library.
