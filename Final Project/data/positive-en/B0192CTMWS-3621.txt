The entire purchasing process went smoothly with this seller. The book was shipped quickly and the seller communicated well. The book itself was in very good condition and was worth the purchase price. I gave it 4 stars because the book jacket was torn in a few places, but again I want to stress that the book itself was in the condition described by seller. I would purchase from this seller again.
