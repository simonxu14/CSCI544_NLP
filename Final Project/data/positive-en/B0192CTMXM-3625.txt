Ah I got this right after it came out (yet now I review it!)<br />This is no doubt a great series with great characters. I definitely enjoyed it. I stayed up till 7 am reading the last parts of it (notice I say last parts, I'm a slow reader). I read all the previous ones at libraries but decided to buy the other 6 since I've been into them since grade school. I'll probably want to read'm again.
