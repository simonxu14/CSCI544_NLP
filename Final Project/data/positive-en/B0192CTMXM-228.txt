Sometimes, I'll go in2 Mc and create a world, where I build something that looks really, really nice and took a lot of time and effort in2 building it. Then, I do something either irrational or stupid or both and then I end up leaving the world. When I return hrs, days, weeks, or even MONTHS later, I'm like: " what was the point of my life in this world again?!?!?" And then hrs l8er I'm like: "oh yea... THAT was the point of my life." And then I get killed by a horde of zombies. LOL sad right? I mean, y is it ALWAYS zombies?
