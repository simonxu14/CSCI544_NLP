Not much to say besides this is a great book. All of the Harry Potter books are incredible, Goblet of Fire is the turning point, in my opinion, of the whole series. It's when we get to dive deeper into the darkness of the wizarding world. Everyone needs to read these books, if you love the movies the books will blow your mind!
