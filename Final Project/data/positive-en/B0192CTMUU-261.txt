In her latest volume of this exceptional series, J.K. Rowling has once again delivered a book to delight both children and adults. While very long, not a word could be cut. Like each of the others, this continued tale  of the adventures of a fledgling wizard is a fun-filled, humor-filled,  adventure-filled page turner that will hold any reader's attention through  to the end. Harry continues his battle against the evil of Lord Voldemort,  and continues to uphold the values of loyalty, integrity, honesty, and  fairplay well enough to make any morally-minded parent more than happy.
