My nine year old Grandaughter and I have listened to all three books on audio cassette while on the way to her school. She attends a private school in the US and knows the difference as Mr. Roger's says between a threat and  make believe.  She has been glued to the cassette as I was in radio's  &quot;Let's Pretend&quot;.  This is a first.  The book is enjoyable,  interesting, and exciting.  It would have to in order to hold her interest  in a lost art...listening.  It has increased our quality time as we listen  together and our imaginations soar.  Get in audio and welcome back exciting  radio.
