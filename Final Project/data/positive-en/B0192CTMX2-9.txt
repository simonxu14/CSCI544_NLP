The best thing to me about the Harry Potter books is the heart. The fantastic and magical world, the wizardry and the colorful characters and the exciting and mysterious plots are all amazingly written, but the love Harry has for his parents and their love for him, the love and bravery  between the three best friends Harry, Ron and Hermione who would die for  each other makes this a most magical series of books.  The writing does get  better and more mature as Harry gets older and J.K. Rowling is very  skillful and subtle at accomplishing this.  Harry has already become a very  memorable character in storytelling history. I can't wait to read the  fourth book and feel sad that J.K. Rowling has decided to stop at seven  -  I hope she changes her mind and we can follow Harry into adulthood!
