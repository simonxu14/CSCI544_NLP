I will forgo the usual plot outline in deference to the wealth of information from other reviewers.  Yes the book is popular with younger readers - but this is not just a kid's book.  As an adult reader, I was surprised and pleased to be as drawn into the J.K. Rowling's world.  What an imagination!  And what a marverlous cast of characters.  Little wonder so many are so taken with the story and that they are so wildly popular.  A wonderful mental vacation - I highly recommend it.  Enjoy!
