Beautiful. Equisite. Just what the Harry Potter books needed. I love the movies, but really don't want Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe in my head when I think of Harry Potter. I've been hoping for a long time illustrated versions of the books would come out creating imagined characters for my mind. The graphics are amazing. Jim Kay's work is brilliant and magical and feels completely in alignment with the book. Very well done!
