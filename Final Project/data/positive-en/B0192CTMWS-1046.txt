I could not put this book down.  Harry is frequently moody and angry in this book (sometimes with good reason, sometimes not), but no less loveable for it.  Rowling writes so well it was easy to feel Harry's frustration and sympathize, even coming from an adult perspective.  I dont' want to give anything away and ruin any of the plot, but it is definitely an outstanding read.  The only problem was that, as I neared the end, I started thinking about the wait for Year 6!  That says something when the only complaint about a book is that it has an end.
