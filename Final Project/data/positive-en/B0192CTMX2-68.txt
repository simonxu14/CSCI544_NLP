I devoured all the Harry Potter books and liked them all thoroughly, but I liked this one less thoroughly. I agree with the reviewer who said that the school of wizardry is itself an important character in all the Harry Potter stories and that, without the school, the time in the woods becomes, not exactly dreary, but less of the page-turner we expect in the Harry Potter books.<br />I have another caveat. I agree with the insight offered by Sander Gilman and Rachel DuPlesis, among others, that &#34;stereotypes can be (and regularly have been) freely associated, even when their association demands a suspension of common sense&#34; (Preface to &#34;Difference and Pathology: Stereotypes of Sexuality, Race,  and Madness&#34; (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1985, page 12).<br />In this final Harry Potter volume, the classic stereotypical (but falsely attributed) characteristics of black slaves are attributed to Dobby and the other elves, who all (except Dobby) are depicted as cherishing their slave status.<br />Another example: the goblins are depicted with the negative stereotype of greed which Europeans and Englishmen have long falsely projected onto Jews. To make this worse, Harry Potter actually proclaims that he dislikes the main goblin in the story. This proclamation, combined with the &#34;explanation&#34; of the nature of &#34;goblin&#34; characteristics, comes across as an implicit acknowledgement of these stereotypical characteristics. (In fact, statistics show that Jews donate to charity, for example, more generously than the national average.) In an apparent attempt to escape criticism for this negative depiction, the author includes among Harry's followers one student with a Jewish name--which means nothing, as the boy is not a leader, while many other minorities ARE included among the leaders of the book's &#34;good guys&#34;. (It would have been best if the book had omitted both kinds of &#34;Jewish&#34; references altogether, just as it abstains from references to believing Christians.) But anyone who has read the series must read this volume too. You will want to know what has happened to Dumbledore, and why Dumbledore trusted Snape, and why &#34;He Who Must Not Be Named&#34; has never found a wand that works against Harry Potter, and.... You will also want to know the application of the legend of the three brothers who encountered Death. So I cannot advise against reading the book. I can only suggest, inadequately, that, in reading the book, the reader be consciously aware of the stereotypes and make a conscious effort to disregard them.
