What can I say about all the Harry Potter books?  Wonderful!  Started out thinking the Potter fad was nonsense and now am one of the biggest fans despite being a senior citizen.  Loved the book but was sad that Jo didn't define the paths the main characters chose for their adult lives.  A bit sparse on some of the details but still wonderful.
