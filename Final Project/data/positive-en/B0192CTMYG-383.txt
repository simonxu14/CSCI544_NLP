I am not sure how the condition of the book was described, but I was a little to surprised to see that the book was bent and a little crumpled at the bottom. Not a huge deal, and it must be stated that I got the book for next to nothing, which was great.<br /><br />I also chose the cheapest shipping option but was a little surprised that book did not arrive for over two weeks and then some.<br /><br />Anyway we got it now and for cheap. I am hoping my 10-year old grand son will get lost in the book. He loves the movies!<br /><br />Cliff Phillips<br />Lawrence, Kansas
