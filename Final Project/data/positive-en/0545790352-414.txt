Beautiful hardcover, I purchased one for myself a few weeks ago and have since decided to buy another copy for my little sister. The illustrated edition opens the series up to a younger audience so that they can take it a chapter at a time. I'm very impressed with Kay's work. This makes a great gift or addition to any Potterhead's collection.
