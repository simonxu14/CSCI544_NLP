Even as an adult, I love the Harry Potter books.  Because of my love of them, I have been purchasing them for my friend's son to read when he gets a little bit older.  This book is when they start to get a bit scary for a young child, but the pre-teen to adult age will love them.<br /><br />I received this in perfect condition in just a few days, too!
