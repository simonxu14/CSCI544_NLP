My name is Jennifer, I'm almost 25, I read technical papers for a living, but I still run to the mailbox when I get home so I can see if the second book came!  The first few chapters I wondered if Rowling had simply edited  a Dahl book.  But after that the book was simply fabulous.  The details  were very original and showed an imagination that is almost non-exisitant  in a generation of television watchers.  Yes, I am proud of my weakness for  Harry Potter books!
