This is a delightful edition of the classic Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  I didn't expect it to be as great as it is!  It's a large coffee table size book with a beautiful dust jacket and an extremely generous amount of illustrations on the inside.  I expected maybe an illustration or two with each chapter but almost every page is gorgeously done by Jim Kay.  Even the pages without images look like journal pages with splotches and aging paper.  I really hope there are intentions to release all the Harry Potter books in this manner because I will definitely get them!
