This book exceeded my expectations!  It was very enjoyable to get all of the answers along with Harry and to finish out this long story with such a bang.  This whole series is morally and grammatically superior to most of the other literature that is published in the US for young readers. Kudos to J.K. Rowling... The end was worth the wait.
