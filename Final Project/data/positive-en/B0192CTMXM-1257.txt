Rowling did a wonderful job with this book, especially with expanding Harry's emotions--he's much more angry in this book, but she captures him very well.  After spending all day reading the book until I was done, I'm hoping she finishes the other two books quicker then this last one, but as she has a new baby, I can understand if it takes a while!
