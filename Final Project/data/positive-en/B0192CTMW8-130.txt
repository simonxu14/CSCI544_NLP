Harry Potter anxiuosly awaits the opening of Hogwarts as the summer vacation progresses. His vacation with his aunt and uncle is anything but pleasant. However,when it is time to return to school, Dobby, an unlikely  ally, tries to keep Harry from doing so because he knows that Harry's life  will be in danger.  Harry, however, disregards the warnings and soon finds  himself enmeshed in the mysterious events occuring at Hogwarts.  Harry  carries us along with his magic through doors of imagination that only J.K.  Rowling could devise.  In the process Harry discovers the Chamber of  Secrets and unravels the mystery surrounding the recent events. This story  revives the child in all of us and helps us escape the world of dark  characters when we put our faith in Harry.  The only saddness comes when  the last page is turned and we are brought back to reality.  I look forward  to Harry's next year at Hogwarts.
