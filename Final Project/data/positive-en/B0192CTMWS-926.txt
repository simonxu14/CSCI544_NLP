I just finished reading the book not an hour ago, and all I have to say is "Wow". Having moved a little beyond being a kid's book, the latest in the series strings you along a plot that is very twisting, most of it not making sense until the very end, which places you right along with Harry: Frustrated, confused, and snappish at those around you. You can almost understand why he is constantly losing his temper not just with Snape and the Slytherins, but also at his best friends, and the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. And, lurking in the background, the Dark Lord is planning something...<br />An excellent read, you'll find it hard to put down, as I did...finished it in 5 days, the last day being the one in which I killed the last 400 pages.
