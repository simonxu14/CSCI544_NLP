I LOVE the Harry Potter books with all of my being. When I purchase this years ago, I LOVED the packaging it came with: &#34;Muggles: do not open until July 21st!&#34; with the owl post on it and such. I still have the original packaging. I never get tired of reading this series and I believe the final book is masterful. Rowling did a beautiful job of wrapping the story up and giving us an era we will never forget.
