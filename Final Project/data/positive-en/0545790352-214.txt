INCREDIBLE!! This is the first sumptuously illustrated volume in what looks like it will be classic edition of the HP series. Jim Kay's illustrations are beautiful and thoughtful and playful. I started reading the series to my daughters when the youngest was six; since then they have become total Potter-philes. My eight-year-old read the whole series to herself in a few months, we've listened to all the audiobooks, and seen the movies numerous times. But this edition is truly magical! BUY IT and treasure it.
