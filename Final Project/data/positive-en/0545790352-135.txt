I can't even begin to say enough good things about this product! First and foremost I am a huge Harry Potter fan, so take that into account. I have small children and tried to start reading the original chapter books to them but the attention span was not working in my favor. The pictures in this book are great and really give my kids something to focus on, a nice picture to go along with the story. Money well spent!
