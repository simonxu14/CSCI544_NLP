The latest installment in the Potter series deals with many teen and adult issues and how they interact with each other. the underlying theme of good verus evil in all of us is very dominant in this book, i feel.<br />The lessons learned for everyone in these books is superbly done and entertains as well with imagination and humor. I do not understand how anyone would say these books were works of the "devil".<br />Read them enjoy them and let your kids roam the imaginary world. it is far safer than this real one!
