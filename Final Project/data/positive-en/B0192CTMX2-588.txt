Harry and the gang return for their 5th year at Hogwarts. With the Ministry getting involved at Hogwarts you know everything will be messed up. Harry gets to fave Voldermort again, but not without a great loss. I enjoyed this book and am glad I waited until the entire series was out before starting it.
