If you're a fan of Harry Potter or trying to get someone else to be a fan, you need to check out this Illustrated Edition. It's a beautiful large format edition (11&#34; tall), with illustrations all throughout the book. Some are just pictures and some are backgrounds and some spread across two pages. If you're a fan you have to check this out.<br /><br />As of the time I'm writing this none of the other volumes have been released but I assume they plan to do them all, book 2 is due soon...
