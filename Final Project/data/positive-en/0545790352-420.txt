Wow!!! This is absolutely beautiful!!! I ordered 2 of these. One for myself and one for my sister. I found this at an AMAZING deal. It was selling for 9.45 after tax and I had prime so it arrived in 2 days. Absolutely worth it. The illustrations are gorgeous. My sister was so excited she stayed up until 7 am reading the whole thing. This is definitely something to have in your HP collection
