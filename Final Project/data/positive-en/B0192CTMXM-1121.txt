I thought this book was great from the start, catching your attention right away, a great continuation of the sixth book, "The Half Blood Prince"I thought it was the best book with the great ending. The deaths of some characters were perfect to leave you sad but motivated to read how the villians loose in end. To find out who was the Half Blood Prince and to see Harry finally live a life in peace with his friends. I can't wait to see how the movie will come out.
