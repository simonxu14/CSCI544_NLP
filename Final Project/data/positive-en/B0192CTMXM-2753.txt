I loved this book.  She answered so many questions.  Once you start reading it is hard to put down, it just never stops.  I wish this was not the end of Harry, but she did an excellent job ending it, and did right by Harry and her faithful readers.  I give it 10 thumbs up, 10 Stars, and 100% LOVED IT!!!!
