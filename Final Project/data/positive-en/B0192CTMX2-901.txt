From my experience, the bulk of people disappointed with Rowling's final book are the hardcore fanshippers.  Some people will be disappointed if they've held on tightly to their dearly loved and yearned for (though perhaps a bit impractical) romantic pairings.<br /><br />I, on the other hand, felt Rowling offered plenty of closure to the series in the way she's always viewed it.  The final book explains all of the reader's unanswered questions, so fear not!<br /><br />I loved this book.  It is not my favorite of the series, but I am very happy with the outcome.  Such a pity that it's all over now...
