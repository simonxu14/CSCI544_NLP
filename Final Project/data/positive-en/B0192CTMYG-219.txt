I jumped onto the Harry Potter bandwagon just before the last book came out and I don't regret it one bit!  Although this one is slightly more kiddish than the later books, it is a great start to the series and is superior in every way to the movie (in my opinion).<br /><br />If you haven't read this book yet, pick it up and read it!  But, be warned, once you read this one, you will have to read the rest of them.  So, plan your time accordingly!
