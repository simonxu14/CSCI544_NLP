As every other reviewer has stated, this book has exceeded my expectations in every way!  The thing that needs to be recognized is that besides changing the title, this book is the original British edition.  While I view this as a plus, having always wanted a copy of the U.K. Editions, some may feel differently.  I just want everyone to be aware of this fact before purchasing.  I was not, but I was pleasantly surprised when I started to read it today!
