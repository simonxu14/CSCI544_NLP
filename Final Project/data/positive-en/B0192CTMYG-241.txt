And it was great! A little on the 'child' side I must say, but hey, it WAS written for kids of 10 years of age. For a children's book, it kept me turning the pages wanting more. Just finished the 2nd book in the series and now on the 3rd. TRUST ME, the story gets BETTER beyond the first book! But you have to read this one first. It sets up the whole story throughout the series.
