Ive been a Harry Potter fan for quite sometime, after reading The Sorcerers Stone I was hooked, excellent plot great for even kids to read, as time went on I picked up the next book as they became available in paperback, well needless to say that I waited over a year for the last book "The Deathly Hallows" and I must say that it was worth the wait, normally I can devour a book in no time but this book was savored, read slowly and totally enjoyed, the story does start off quite formatable but then in no time it just takes off, one event after another happening and the quest behind Harry and his companions Hermoine and Ron leave nothing to chance, the story is very well thought and written, the amazing things in this last book will leave you crying for the chapters to never end, every emotion will be felt in this last book, the triumphs, the sorrows and pain....it will keep you quite occupied and hungry for more, I know it did for me, every last detail in this book was brilliant...like I said very well thought and written, if your a Harry Potter fan then this book is a must have and it must be read not once but dozens of times, Ive read it 3 time already and love each time more than the last.
