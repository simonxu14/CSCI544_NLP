I knew that I will like this book, but still it was great to actually read it!  When I saw the poster, I did not like the illustration, but it looked great on book cover. The story is combined with two things, a story of the teenagers, and the story of the adults. The best part was, the  author did not separate the two of them. So the book was very well written,  and had a lot of things to read between lines. It was a little bit heavy to  read (my arms are aching) but it was worth to spend my weekend with it. The  characters were developed quite a lot in this book too. I could see they  are actually GROWing. Overall, this book was as satisfying as the other  three volumes.
