The book was in wonderful condition, looking shiny and new. However, It doesn't include the #s of the pokemon. They are listed in alphabetical order, so it doesn't go by when the pokemon was released/discovered. I grew up with that being kind of a big thing, but since it isn't for me its fine, my nanny kiddo can't set it down.
