Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a fitting end to the series that J K Rowling introduced us to the young orphan who discovers that he is the son of wizards.  The pace of Book 7 is much faster than the previous 2 installments and makes it hard to put the book down.  Although a much darker book with death and violence every other page, it truly does let Harry "grow up" with his friends and ties a lot of the loose ends back together. But, Ms. Rowling, although she has said this is the last Harry Potter book, certainly has left herself an out to leverage this series into another possible series or even a follow-up to this book.  A great read and a fitting conclusion (if it is the end!!)
