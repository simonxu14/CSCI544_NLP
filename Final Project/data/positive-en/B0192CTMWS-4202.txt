I won't ruin the book for anyone who hasn't read it yet.  I got my copy in yesterday and ended up reading it all in one day.  All I can say, without ruining any surprises, is that the book does not disappoint.  If you've been a reader of all the Harry Potter books (and not just someone who has watched the movies) this book is the payoff for all your patience.  All the plotpoints are resolved and everything is explained.  Great series!  Kudos to J.K. Rowling!
