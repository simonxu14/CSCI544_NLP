I was a skeptic for a long time about the Harry Potter phenomenon.  I tried reading &quot;Philosopher's Stone&quot; (Sorcerer's Stone to all  numbskull Americans) about three times but never got beyond the first two  chapters.  Finally, at my nephew's urging, I read everything through  &quot;Azkaban&quot;...and I was hooked.  And now, with this terrific fourth  book, JK Rowling has made a believer out of me, the person who thought no  one else could touch the works of JRR Tolkien, E. Nesbit, Susan Cooper and  Edward Eager.  But she's up there with the masters now!  &quot;Goblet&quot;  has all the requisite passion, suspense, thrills and wonder of the best of  fantasy, magic and mystery books.  But as in all the fine books that have  come before this series (The Lord of the Rings, The Dark Is Rising  sequence, etc.), the main character would be nothing without the help,  faithfulness and bravery of his friends. As much as I love Harry, I also  love Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Sirius, the Weasleys, and, in this  last book, poor doomed Diggory.  I alternately bit my nails, screamed out  loud, and cried through the last 100 pages.  I'm spent.  Thank you, Ms.  Rowling -- you've made my summer.
