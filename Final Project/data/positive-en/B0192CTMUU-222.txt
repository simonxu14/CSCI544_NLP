I must admit that after I saw the size (734 pps) of the new book, I was quite concerned that J.K. Rowling must have been in need of a good editor.  But, true to form, she wastes not a word or description.  My only reason to  skip text would be to get to the next part, but I couldn't because the  world she created is so rich and deep, I would miss something.<br />Then, as  I started reading the book, I thought she must be getting sloppy in her  surprises.  In Book 1 she surprised me, in Book 2 she surprised me, so in  Book 3 I didn't bother to guess and just let her drive the sleigh.  In this  book, I quickly caught her attempts to trick me and KNEW. Imagine my  surprise and delight when she fooled me again!<br />Now, to wait for year 5  at Hogwarts, and for my son to finish it so we can laugh about it.
