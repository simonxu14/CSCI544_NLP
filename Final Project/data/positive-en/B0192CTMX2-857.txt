Ok, since I got the book, I have read nonstop. I, like a gazzilion others, have waited soooooo long, couldn't help myself.<br />I was waiting for the happy mystical adventure the other books held, but it's much darker than the others. Harry is in the midst of teenage years and it seems constant PMS - One of the charms of the other books has been the chemistry between HP and Dumbledore, and Hagrid, and others - Yes, a major character dies, and that is a turning point - this book answers many of the questions we have asked ourselves - from why Harry has to stay at the Dursley's to what is truly going on in regard to the 'legend' of the return of Voldemort and the battle to defeat the evil forces - it is fascinating and worth wading thru the angst and angst and angst...<br />For charm, go back to HP and the Prisoner of Azkaban - for answers to your questions, read this one -
