Our order finally arrived just before Christmas.  For the most part, the book was as described.  Packaging left much to be desired.  The book was swimming in an exceptionally large padded envelope.  I appreciated the padded parcel, though.  In terms of the final HP story; we haven't finished to book.  Will update this post later.
