I thought this last volume very well done, although I noticed a number of details that got overlooked. For example...  What are the prinicipal characters doing in their later lives?  Who is the new headmaster of Hogwarts?  the book contains both drama and pathos, tragedy and heroism.  It also clearly borrows a bit from modern culture, as noted in some of the dialogue; see the clever reference to the movie "Aliens" near the end of the book.  The center section dragged a bit, but all in all,it is a masterful work.
