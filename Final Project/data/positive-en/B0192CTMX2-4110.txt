Rowling has again weaved a tale that is worth the hype and the wait. The characters - new and old - do not disappoint and every page is waiting to be turned. The next book can not come out soon enough -with some old questions from the previous books being answered and new questions being raised. With shockers, humor, laughter, and tears- Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix has it all.
