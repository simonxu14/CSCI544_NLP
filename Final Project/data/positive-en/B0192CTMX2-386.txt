I did not plan on reading the Harry Potter books put by accident I came<br />across J.K.Rowling bio on dvd and I was so taken by her imagination as<br />a child and through her adult life I decided to check it out and I could not<br />get enough of these books I would read the book and then watch the<br />movies which are fantastic! I have watch the movies over and over,and<br />now I am on book 7 and will read it as slow as possible because I just<br />hate the series to end . If you don't have time to read the books get<br />the dvd's the production is outstanding and who ever did the casting<br />for that movie really bought the books to life. Danial,Rubert, and Emma<br />are great little actors and they are the kids in that book. My favorate was<br />the first book and the first movie those kid are so cute. Please check<br />these books out they are not just for children. Gabi
