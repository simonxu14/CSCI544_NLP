I became a fan of HP before they got popular in the US and have the orIginla books. I love this illustrated verison. It is beautiful. I bought it for my kids so I can start reading them the story (oldest is 5). I love it so much, I'll be getting 2 more for niece and nephew to have and I'll be buying the rest of the books when they come out as illustrations! If you are a fan or know someone who is, you won't be disappointed with this!
