Just a few comments.  Rowling is one of the finest story tellers, ever.  I have to admit seeing all of the films except the last - and thinking why not read the books first.  The best decision I could have made.  There are layers and layers of details, texture, character devlopment and plot details that never made it into the film.  If you want to understand things like emotions, motivation, and really understand why things unfold the way they do in later books and movies..read this book.  And I do agree (so far) with other readers.  This has one of the most engaging, well-paced stories of the series.  Highly recommend.<br /><br />Plus, there's a whole Quiddich tournament in here that isn't in the movie.
