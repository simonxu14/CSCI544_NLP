This book is stunning. My husband says its a way to rip people out of money since they plan on doing it for all 7 books. Though tons of money will be made, I'll never regret buying this or any of the future ones I am sure. The illustrations bring the book to life and make it ideal for parents who want to read Harry Potter aloud to their younger children. I know I will one day and am thrilled with my purchase.
