I have never felt the Harry Potter books are really childrens' books. As an adult tuned in to these books by another adult, I was amazed at how delightful, imaginative, funny and well-written they all are.  And, with  #4, they just keep getting better.  The tone changes with Goblet of Fire,  and the ending is not necessarily as upbeat as the first three, but it does  not diminish Rowling's accomplishments.  There are so many layers to this  book, so many things adults can delve into, that it has the distinction of  being a book series that almost anyone can enjoy.  Bravo to J.K. Rowling!
