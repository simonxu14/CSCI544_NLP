The Harry Potter books are my favorite new reading find, and I can't say enough good things about them.  This latest in the Harry Potter saga is better than the second in the series (Harry Potter and the Chamber of  Secrets) and almost as good as the wonderful first (Harry Potter and the  Sorcerer's Stone).  It's somehow not quite as dark as the second book,  although parts of it are still too scary for bedtime reading to a six year  old.  It's perfect for 9-12 year olds, or for 41 year olds. Harry is back  at Hogwarts, beset by his old adversaries Professor Snape and Draco Malfoy,  and the wonderful returning cast of his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione  Granger.  There are some delightful cheer out loud moments in the book--the  appointment new Care of Magical Creatures professor and the climactic  quiddich (sp?) matches.  J.K. Rowling continues her wonderful comic touches  with minor characters (the Divinations professor Trewlaney), her charming  offbeat world (the Knight Bus) and the emotionally powerful theme of Harry  learning more about his parents and their final struggle to save his life  by giving theirs.  There are new dangerous creatures, the menacing  Dementors, and the delightful mystery of Sirius Black and the mysterious  Grim--are they the sinister characters they seem, or does J.K. Rowling have  another plot twist and secret villain in mind, like in the first book?  You'll have to read this new one to find out, and it's a delightful read.
