I got this book for my 8 year old son and he loved it.  He loved book number one as well.  I would highly recommend this book to children of that age group, either for them to read themselves (if they are up to it) or to have read to them.  Starting with book three, though, there is a pretty jarring shift in terms of linguistic complexity, pace, and content.  In my experience, the first two books are the best for young children, and then book 3 and 4 seem to be better for kids who are a couple years older.  My son powered through those, but was noticeably less interested. There is another pretty jarring shift in content and complexity in book 5, and at that point we decided to set aside the series until he is a bit older.  All the books are great, but i just seems that they appeal to kids at different ages.  This makes sense since the books are about children growing up, but still it makes it kind of tricky to know when to introduce the series to your child.  Book one is cute and funny, and by book 7 it has become pretty dark and death-obsessed.
