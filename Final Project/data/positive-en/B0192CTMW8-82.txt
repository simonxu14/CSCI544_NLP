Harry Potter has never been accused of being a Nobel Prize contender, but I firmly believe that not every book has to be. Harry Potter is quite entertaining, however. I downed the entire book in one day because I couldn't stop turning the pages.<br /><br />In Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets, something at Hogwarts has been turning those closest to Harry into stone. There is an addictive quality to Harry Potter that just sucks the reader in. I kept turning the page, trying desperately to put the pieces together to figure out just who was turning people into stone.<br /><br />Pacing is Rowling's ultimate gift because she gives the reader pieces of the story puzzle, but not enough where the reader finds the ending tired and predictable. Can't wait to read more!
