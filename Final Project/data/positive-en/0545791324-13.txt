I have the read the Harry Potter series numerous times, but this is such a wonderful new way to explore the books. I am re-reading the books to my 7 and 5 year old who are just as enchanted as I am by these illustrations. It's a perfect companion to my ever-growing HP collection. I will definitely be buying the whole collection of illustrated books as they come out!
