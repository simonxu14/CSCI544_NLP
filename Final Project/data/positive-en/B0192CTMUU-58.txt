The only reason that this is not a 5 star review is that the cassettes they use are incredibly cheaply made and tend to stick, break, snag, or otherwise malfunction.  (The CDs obviously do not have this issue.)  In terms of performance and content, this whole series is spectacular...something akin to old time radio.  You can see everything unfold in your head just as the author intended, without missing anything like the movies leave out.  Jim Dale is a rock star of the spoken word...unique voices for all the characters and flawless diction...you can understand every word he utters.
