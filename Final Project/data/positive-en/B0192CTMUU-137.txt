After misplacing my first copy of Harry Potter & the Goblet of Fire in junior high, I decided to purchase this copy as a replacement. I'm so glad I did! Even though it is a used book, it is still in very good condition, although the binding does seem like it's seen better days. All in all, this book is a very good copy for the money.
