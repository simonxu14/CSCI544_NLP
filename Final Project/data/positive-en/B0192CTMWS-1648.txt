If you liked Order of the Phoenix than you will probably enjoy the entire book HP#7.  If you don't like a LOT of self doubt and introspection you will not enjoy the first half of this story.  It reminded me of Frodo in the swamp.  But stick with it.  From the point were the kids are captured it starts to become a good story with all the adventure, action and characture development you could wish for.  I'm glad that Ms. Rowling included the last chapter to "tell us what happened to everyone later in life."  It was a great way to finish the story and the series.<br /><br />Ms. Rowling really explores what makes a person a certain way.  Are any of us really all good or all "bad"?  Heroes can be full of self doubt and take some missteps along the way.  But being able to accept who they really are and take the action they know in their heart is correct, is what will make this a great book and ultimately make a hero a hero.
