I enjoyed this book very much, I knew there would be an ending and I wouldn't have to wait two or three years to find out the rest of the story.  The characters are believable and the story moves in an orderly fashion if you believe in a wizarding world.  A really good, enjoyable book always leaves you wondering what else happened to the characters.  This was a very, very enjoyable book.
