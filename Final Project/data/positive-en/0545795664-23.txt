My kids havenâ€™t put this book down since we got it.  My kids are still young and were not the generation that grew up watching Pok&eacute;mon so they are not as familiar with the characters.  They do however love Pok&eacute;mon-go and this book tells them all they need to know about each Pok&eacute;mon.  Its illustration is great, its in alphabetical order and gives all the information my children want, but not too much to be overwhelming.
