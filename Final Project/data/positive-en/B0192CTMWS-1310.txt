Given that there are over 3000 reviews of this book as I type this, I had to read the 1 Star reviews to see what people had problems with in regards to Phoenix.<br />Ok let�s cover what I feel were positives about the book:<br />1. Harry grows up.  What do people expect that he will be the naive 11 year old of Sorcerer's Stone forever?  Harry delves into emotions he has never experienced before.  Harry pops off and shares his emotions (he's always done that, it's just before now they've mostly been happy ones).  Guess what 15 year olds are moody, don�t know how to handle emotions well and some times make bad choices.  Harry is a normal teen (wizard), even if he is special.<br />2. JK makes 870 pages fly by.  There is no doubt that it is long; however, I am equally confident that in some ways the book is too short.  My one complaint is that she failed on some of the details that we have come to love (like the House Cup, Dumbledore's end of term speech, etc).  Sure you could have cut out some parts and sure she could have expanded others, but the bottom line is the story is still great and JK had a lot of explaining to do and she did it.  Basically she wrapped up most of the questions asked in the first four books, even if she left the "little details" of book 5 unfinished.<br />3. Book 5 is all about answering questions.  It is almost as if the first three books detailed the life of wizards with a weak and non-"alive" Voldemort and book four and five deal with a "live" Voldemort and the damage he is capable of inflicting.  This means six and seven must be about the conclusion and the completion of the prophecy.  Not quite three trilogies (shout out to star wars fans) but close enough and more than enough books to sufficiently cover the subject.<br />4. The character to die was in fact the most likely character to do.  His sense of bravado, ego, and love for Harry were all mixed into his recklessness and risk taking which lead to his death.  Could the scene have been written better, probably, but in the end, JK did just fine and I will cut her some slack on this one because killing him was hard.<br />5.  We learn more about the future.  O.W.L.�s and possible careers are discussed even though we full well know what Harry�s future career will be (if he survives I assume), however there are many sociological facts and features in the book as well which give us a closer look to this special community.<br />I mentioned earlier my only negative and I did catch one error, Hermoine and Harry have their wands confiscated by Malfoy before they march in the forest, yet they have them in the Ministry and JK never explains how they got them back.  Hmm.<br />I loved this book and look forward to re-reading it soon.  It�s worth it�s price in gold because it will be read again by my kids someday, as a part of the one of the most fantastic tales ever.
