I got this item for my daughter and she loves it. It is a really well put together book and the pictures are gorgeous. I would definitely recommend this for anyone that likes pokemon. It is very cool to see all the information able the specific pokemon that you would see in the pokedex and more. Occasionally they pick pokemon for full page pictures and they look really cool.
