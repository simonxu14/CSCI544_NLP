Upon receiving Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, J.K. Rowling's latest brilliant creation, I plunged right into it and could scarcely put it down until the end.  Now that it's over, I can't help but feel a twinge of sadness upon leaving Rowling's beautifully constructed magical world.<br />Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is evidence of the continued evolution of Rowling's imagination.  Harry's world is painted as vividly as it has been before, and Rowling reveals more details of Harry's past that fit together like pieces of an intricate puzzle.  Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix is a great deal darker than its four predecessors.  Harry is angrier in book 5, and much of the story deals with his realization that the heroes that he has idealized in the past are, in fact, as human and fallible as he is.  Harry has grown into an adolescent, and Rowling shows an incredible ability to write accordingly.<br />It is very difficult to compare this book with any of the previous Harry Potter books, as Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix relies on its predecessors much more than the others have done.  Taken as an individual work, this book is wonderful, but the Harry Potter series is richest when seen as a cohesive whole.  Rowling's latest creation is another incredibly imaginative, fun, and thoughtful part of the Harry Potter series.  My only regret is that I finished it so quickly and am now forced to wait for book six.
