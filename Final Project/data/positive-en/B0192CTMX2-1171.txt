This is by far the best book ever. Along with its extra artwork and full size chapter imagines in the back it makes reading the last Harry Potter book a delightful experience. The book is in such great quality made you can read it, reread it, and pass it along friends without having to worry about its spine coming apart. I definitely recommend this edition of the book, it makes the experience much much better.
