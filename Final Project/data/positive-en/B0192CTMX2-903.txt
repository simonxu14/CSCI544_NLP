I like the Harry Potter books, though I only recently got in to them after seeing the two movies.  While the first few books are fairly innocent, it's obvious the novels are growing up with Harry himself.  This one was much darker than the previous books and scared me quite a bit!<br />The story was interesting, once I started reading it I couldn't put it down.  I wanted to know what crazy rule Dolores Umbridge was going to instill upon Hogwarts next.  Once Harry starts taking private lessons from Professor Snape, the book gets extremely good.  After that, I REALLY couldn't put it down!  I was slightly disappointed in the ending, it just didn't seem right to me.  Overall, great book.  While not as great as some of the others, it was definitely a fantastic read.  I can't wait for #6!
