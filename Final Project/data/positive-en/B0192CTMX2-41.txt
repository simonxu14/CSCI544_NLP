Highly enjoyed this final book to this series. While I disliked one statement by Dumbledore in the second to last book, this final book seemed to hit the mark.  I particularly enjoyed the family building uplifting message that love can see us through difficult times.  The example of Harry being the kind of man that was brave, clever and masculine enough to be a guide, protector and provider for those that depended upon him is a good role model for boys in a world that otherwise mocks men as stooges and incompetents.  Thank you J.K. Rowling for providing good role models for both sexes in these books.
