Harry Potter and friends are all grown up and leaving Hogwarts.  I will really miss them and their adventures.  Please don't abandon Harry Ms. Rowland, write about his family or heirs.  I so enjoyed this series even though I am a grandmother and great grandmother.  Rowland's writing spans generations.
