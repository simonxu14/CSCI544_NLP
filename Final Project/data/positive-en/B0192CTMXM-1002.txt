This book is one you probably won't enjoy if you haven't read the previous books (though I can't imagine someone picking it up if they hadn't -- maybe in years to come), but it is exceptional in a variety of ways.<br /><br />Rowlings descriptions are, as always, beautiful and exacting.  The book is an excellent example of a hero's quest (though mostly the end), and the human emotions are well captured -- even in situations the reader may not be able to fully understand or relate.<br /><br />Well written, a fantastic ride, fabulous addition to the series.
