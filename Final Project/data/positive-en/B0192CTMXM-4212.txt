Brilliant! Amazing! Fantastic! Perfectly satisfying! I loved it! As so many have said more eloquently than I will, JK Rowling hit the jackpot with this last book, and tied all the threads from previous books together in such a satisfying way! I laughed and cried, I read it all in one go - I couldn't put it down. Now I just have to NOT tell my son who's reading it anything, so I won't spoil it for him. Shame on anyone who would do that!
