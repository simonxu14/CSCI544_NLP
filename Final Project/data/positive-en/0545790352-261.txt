This has been a favorite book of mine and of two of my daughters for many years.  Our previous copy was falling apart because it was purchased in the year 2000 and had been read by all of us many times.  We are starting a new collection of the picture books as they come out.  The illustrations in this volume are beautiful, and really capture the spirit of the story and characters.  This will become a treasured family book among all of us.
