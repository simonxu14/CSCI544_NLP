I got my book on the release date (Sat. 7/21/07), and could not WAIT to delve in. However, being it was my husband's birthday and we had dinner reservations, I could not begin as soon as I had wished!<br /><br />It took me a total of 12 hours to read the entire book between Saturday 7/21 & Sunday 7/22 - I have not read that fast since High School (mind you, I got up to use the facilities, stretch, and enliven my numb bum every few hours!) and have not enjoyed a book so much as the other 6 HP books.<br /><br />If you are an adult that thinks Harry Potter is silly, boring, not your thing, a waste of time - THINK AGAIN! I am 38 years old and do NOT have any children. I did not start reading the HP books until I found #6 in the bargain bin at the grocery store while on vacation. As soon as I got home from vacation, I read the other 5 volumes and then re-read #6. I then put myself on the pre-order list for #7.<br /><br />Book #7 is the coup de gras - AMAZING!! Others say there's something missing, or she didn't keep her word (about revealing things she promised to from the other books) - BUT I DISAGREE TOTALLY.<br /><br />From the first page until the last page of the Epilogue I could NOT put it down. The twists, the turns, the decisions, the emotions, the losses, the gains, the friends, the enemies. WHEW!! It still confounds me how JKR transmuted all those things from the pages to me - I actually felt all of it in my own body and mind like I was actually looking thru a window witnessing the environment first hand.<br /><br />Yes, I am sad to see the series come to an end.<br /><br />No, I will NOT beg for more - well, OK, I DO hope JKR publishes a companion book (like a dictionary) of spells, terminology, creatures (with pics I hope!), etc.<br /><br />I, as a muggle, can't seem to remember when, where, and which page I read about certain charms, etc. I think a companion book to the series would be most celebrated and invited.<br /><br />To all nay-sayers I offer this tidbit of advice: Love this series and finale for what JKR gave us. Her creativity and imagination brought me into a world I could have never fathomed. What a wonderful gift - to bestow someone with their imagination again!<br /><br />Long live JKR and Harry Potter!
