First of all - I really liked the book.  It was exciting, scary, funny, sad, and ... wow... it's over.  It sucked me in, and didn't let go until I turned the last page of the epilogue.<br /><br />Do I think there are some flaws? As in the other books, absolutely.  The biggest flaw is that it left me with some big questions - I wanted to know a bit more about the outcome of the battle of Hogwarts.  How did it shake up the wizarding world?  What the heck happened to Umbridge? What about the death eaters?  I'd like to know more about the main characters, other than answers about who ended up with whom.  Some folks like the loose ends, but for a book that's supposed to END the series, I'm was slightly disappointed in that.<br /><br />But, all in all, a worthy way to end the series. Now, I hope JKR DOES publish the encyclopedia she's suggested she might do.
