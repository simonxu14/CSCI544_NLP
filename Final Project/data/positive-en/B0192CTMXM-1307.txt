There are spoilers below so please stop reading is you don't want to know what happens.<br /><br />I first read this final book in the Harry Potter saga the day it came out.  Read it in one sitting.  Needless to say, I don't remember much.  It was a late night of reading.  So I've read it again.  I remember Rowling stating that 3 main characters would die in this book.  However, I felt there were more.  Death hits right of the bat with Hedwig, this was very sad, poor owl.  Then Mad-Eye, Fred Weasly, Tonks, Lupin, Snape, Voldermort, Dobby, and Harry.  The Horcruxes were much more understandable and Albus' black hand was explained as well.  I recommend you read the books one right after the other.  All the Horcruxes and other little things from the previous books come together in this book.  It's a very moving book as Harry has to face his own death.  Once the story of Snape is revealed, it's hard to hate him completely.  Everything he did for love of a woman.  Rowling did a great job with Snape; nasty as he was he turns out to be a bit of a hero.<br /><br />Once Voldermort is killed, the book then shifts into the Epilogue which takes place 19 years later.  I wish there was more to this.  Draco and his family survived and he and Harry meet each other on platform 9 Â¾ when sending off their children.  However, all that is exchanged is a nod between them.  I'd like to have seen more, after all, a big part of the last book and this book revolved around him appointed to killing Dumbledore.  It would have been nice to know what exactly Ron and Harry do now that they are adults.  Who's the new headmaster of Hogwarts, and what of Luna?<br /><br />I've read on the net Rowling is going to write another book in the series, but it could be 10 years from now.  I'm eager for another book on Harry Potter as I do truly love these books.  Movies are pretty good too, although the books are better (but that's normal for movies made from books).
