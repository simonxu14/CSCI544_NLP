Deathly Hallows is an excellent end to the wonderful Harry Potter Series.  I shall not however waste my time recommending this book to others to read because frankly by the time you've read book 6 you've long been hooked.  Rowling's world is truly an amazing and well thought out place.<br />There is only one weak point to this book is that I personally found the hiding in the forest part a little tiresome.  However, the ending is amazing and I truly loved how Rowling pulled off such a satisfactory conclusion.  This is my second favorite Book series I've read and my only regret when I finished the epilogue is this was the last book, but all good things must come to an end.<br /><br />Enjoy this book, it is quite the journey!!
