OotP is not disappointing but could use the help of an editor.  It's long and drags in places; there are also a few minor errors.  My biggest complaint is the death scene.  J. K. feigns so many deaths throughout the book that when the "big one" comes, it's anti-climatic.  In fact, the near-death scene at the middle of the book was more emotional for me.<br />Don't expect any plot twists or much clever new material.  It seems J. K. becoming bored with the story or perhaps she is too occupied now with movies, fame, kids and a husband.  Having to pay the rent seemed to force more/better creativity from her!<br />Still, I would rate the book a "must read."
