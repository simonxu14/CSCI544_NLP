The Order of the Pheonix is the longest, and funniest, harry potter book yet, Harry is going into his fifth year at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry, a year since the Dark Lord Voldemort (gasp!) came back from the grave, the ministry of magic doesn't believe that he's come back, so they are trying to discredit everyone who's telling them that he has.  They also try to take full control of the school, creating a "high inquisitor" who trys to fully take control of the school, however, the "High Inquisitor" is prevented by the rather amusing heroics of the weasleys.  it is the best Harry Potter book yet, though they will eventually have to be published in several volumes if the length trend continues...
