I am a huge Harry Potter fan and have been in love with the franchise since I read the first book in 1999, this is a MUST for any fan, particularly those who want to introduce their younger children to the magic of Harry Potter.  My six year old absolutely LOVES the beautiful illustrations and is very excited to be reading it. It's even encouraging her to try reading several passages herself.<br /><br />As for the pictures, I was expecting just a few basic illustrations, but I was blown away by how intricate and beautiful each and every one of the many illustrations are.  It is clear that a lot of time and effort was put in to get them just right.  I could not be more pleased!
