Dear Ms. Rowling:<br /><br />I just finished reading DEATHLY HALLOWS on the day it was released. Thank you, thank you, thank you for the wonderful world that is Harry Potter! I absolutely loved DEATHLY HALLOWS ... you wrapped and closed everything up very neatly. I even felt sad saying goodbye to Privet Drive at the very start of the book.<br /><br />I was certain that (1) Dumbledore would come back; and (2) Harry would die. I've never been more glad to have been more wrong about a book in my life.  :-)<br /><br />I loved your use of humor throughout the book, and cried every time someone died. As I read DEATHLY HALLOWS, I often found myself wondering how much your experiences in creating the earlier books impacted your later books. I especially enjoyed your teasing take on sensationalistic media through the quill of Rita Skeeter.<br /><br />Wonderful, wonderful! You have truly created a magical masterpiece that will stand for years to come. My daughter grew up reading books 4, 5 and 6, and tonight she just asked me if I would read her books 1,2, and 3 for bedtime stories! (This from a young lady who just last week told me she was "old enough" to read her own bedtime stories!). I very much look forward to reading the books to my daughter ... and to my grandchildren, whenever that day should come.<br /><br />You have done great things, Ms. Rowling. Celebrate your masterpiece!
