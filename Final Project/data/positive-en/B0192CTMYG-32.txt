What is NOT-TO-LOVE about any of the Harry Potter books or films?<br /><br />Author J.K. Rowling NAILS IT in every way. Her portrayal of a young wizard and all that surrounds him is wondrously fantastic as high fantasies go.<br /><br />I LOVE LOVE LOVE the stories, and her ability to capture the pure essence of growing up amongst the many peers of our times.<br /><br />This story as well all of her Harry Potter stories are absolutely well worth the read and see. See the films too. I have all of them, and enjoy reading the novel and then seeing the film that followed. It's a great look into how the novels were transpired...blended into films. From white... to sight!<br /><br />*Cheers* always NIS<br /><br />And besides... &#34;Potter&#34; happens to be a family name of mine. So there! :--)
