Let me start off first by saying that I enjoyed the book, though it seems to me that Rowling has simply chosen to use this book as a filler and a means to an end.  From what I can discern, only three major issues are brought out, and character development is largely squashed by Harry's temper.  Ron and Hermione come no closer to realizing what they mean to each other, and though Harry teaches his talents to others, he doesn't display a large improvement himself.<br />Though I was sad to see a main character die, their involvement in this book is minimal and Rowling shows no effort to make the reader more fond of the character during this book.  I think overall the book draws on the reader's emotional attachment in past books rather than developing a further empathy.<br />I still love the Potter series, and anxiously await more novels, but Rowling seems to have held back in the Order of Phoenix.  I only hope she has a reason for this (maybe the next books will be that much better for it?).
