Best book so far in the series. Mystery, comedy, suspense, joy & sorrow. Intricate story lines that twist and turn and finally join together in the end. This book is for old and young alike - I'm in my mid 30's and am absolutely loving this series. Now on to Order of the Phoenix! (Warning, the movie version of Harry's 4th year is a GIGANTIC let down!)
