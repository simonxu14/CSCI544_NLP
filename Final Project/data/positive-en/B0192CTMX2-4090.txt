Having finished the book as quickly as my reading pace would allow, I have two big comments: I bet I would have liked this more if it were 200 pages shorter; and I really wish Harry would step back and "think" a bit more.  But, after the long wait for this text, I guess the length is a reward -- there is a lot of information for reading and rereading as we wait for number six.  And, of course, I realize that Harry is just 15 and that at times 15-year olds are confused and rebellious.  It's just that Harry is "special," and I expect him to come through everying (even puberty) with intelligence and courage.
