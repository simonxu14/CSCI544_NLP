The fifth book is every bit as captivating as the others.  Once again we're drawn in to the magical world to experience Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts.  After witnessing Voldemort's return to power at the completion of the Triwizard Tournament, Harry returns to the Dudley's house on Privet Drive.  He's frustrated by the lack of information given to him from his friends in the wizarding world and spends much of his time alone.  When he does return to Hogwarts, he has to deal with not only the disbelief of the Ministry of Magic (that Voldemort has risen again) but that of his peers as well.  Harry finds himself struggling with his anger about being kept in the dark about the Order of Phoenix and about the how terribly the year appears to be progressing at Hogwarts.  As the plot thickens the chapters near the end start to get very fast paced and you're hanging off the edge of your seat until it's finally over and you regret that this installment has come to an end.  It was disappointing that Harry didn't find Sirus' mirror until it was to late, but I loved the book and I can't wait for the next.
