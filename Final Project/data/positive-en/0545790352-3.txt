The numerous illustrations are a wonderful addition to a brilliant book and will bring the story to life for young readers just growing into the series.  Be aware, however, that books in this new illustrated series are quite substantial in size and weight, with pages so wide that column format is used for the text.  I imagine that later books in the series will rival encyclopedias.  Prepare your bookshelf accordingly.
