This was the most enchanting and thoroughly engrossing book I have read in a very long time. Harry Potter is a hero who appeals, not just to children, but to anyone who has ever dreamed of stepping out of their mundane lives  and into the realm of magical adventure.  Though written for children, I  feel this book has a lot to say to adults as well, about their kids, and  about themselves.  I most enjoyed the mythical elements of the story - like  the Star Wars movies - it plays on our most cherished archetypes.  I think,  were mythology scholar Joesph Campbell still alive he would have loved this  book.  I know I did.  I will be giving it to everyone I know - nieces and  nephews, friends and my parents. J.K. Rowling has given children's  literature a new classic, on par with the Narnia Chronicles and A Wrinkle  in Time.
