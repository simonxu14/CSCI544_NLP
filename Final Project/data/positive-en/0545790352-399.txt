I gave this to my girlfriend for Valentine's Day because she is an avid Harry Potter fan and didn't get this for Christmas because of availability.  The illustrations are so vivid and are very well done.  The thickness of the pages and jacket/cover are substantial and overall, the book is well made.  For the very reasonable price and quality, this is an easy choice for new and old HP fans.
