J.K. Rowling's fifth installment is very well written - As usual, Jim Dale does another fine job of portraying the characters all within this book.  This story is sadder and darker than any of J.K. Rowling's previous Harry Potter books - and is a much better story than the Hollywood movie.<br /><br />I recommend the entire series. Because they are expensive, piece the audio books in over time. Every so often, my wife and I start at book one and continue through book seven. If you enjoy wonderfully read fantasy, you will not be disappointed.
