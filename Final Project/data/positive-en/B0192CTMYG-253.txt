For my dad who's retired and likes to spend time reading, is a fanatic of the series and watches the films over and over. It was time to get the books, I ordered this one first, just to give it a shot. it arrived perfectly fine, and the translation to spanish is perfect. He read it entirely and now he wants the rest of the books. Hardcover is fine, the prints are low sized for an old man but he didn't have a problem, reading with glasses.<br /><br />Overall very satisfied!
