Come on . . . only 5 stars!?!?  Just had to add my WOW to pretty much the rest of the world.  I read Book 5 in TWO days!! My 13-year-old daughter has read them all right through and my 9-year-old is impatient to start Book 1 this summer!  I can't say enough good stuff about this whole series and we're ALL waiting impatiently for the next SOMETHING ~ book, movie, whatever!
