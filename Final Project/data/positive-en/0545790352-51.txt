The illustrations are stunning. This is a must have for any Harry Potter fan! I can't wait to read this to my daughter and let her imagination run away with her when she sees the drawings.<br /><br />When I first read the series, I loved the drawings as the start of each chapter, and I often found myself turning back to the jacket to look at the interpretation of a particular character or scene. I love that there are now so many more images to look at and help paint a mental picture while reading the books. Can't wait for the rest of the series to come out!
