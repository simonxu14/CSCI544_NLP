The Goblet of Fire is about as long as the previous three Harry Potter books put together.  I was worried going into this that the magic would run out - that Rowling might have been caving under the pressure of having to produce a Harry Potter book each year.  Some of the reviews I had read suggested as much.<br />Well, the magic is still going strong.  True, this is a long book (we do not arrive at Hogwarts until around page 200), but, like Harry, I want to spend as much time at Hogwarts as possible.  The story is just as engrossing here as in the previous novels.  This, in fact, may be my favorite so far.<br />The story concerns a contest amongst several schools of wizardry.  The book begins with Lord Voldemort so I don't think I'm giving too much away by saying he has something interesting planned for Harry in the tournament.<br />This is darker than the previous two books.  The similarity with Lord of the Rings becomes more apparent.  As Harry grows up, circumstances become more and more dire.  I have not yet read Order of the Phoenix, but I am looking forward to it.
