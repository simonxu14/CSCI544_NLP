If you're only interested in the story, this might not be the book for you. This is actually a collector's item. The book is overly big and heavy and each individual page is of excellent high-quality heavy weight paper. The illustrations are beautifully done and do add to the reading experience. An attached ribbon makes tracking your progress easy. Originally, when I bought my first Harry Potter - Sorcerer's Stone book, I could only find it in paperback while all of the other books were easily available in hardback. This makes my collection feel more complete.
