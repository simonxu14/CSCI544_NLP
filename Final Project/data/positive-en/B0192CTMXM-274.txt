The final book in an amazing series.  What can I say that has not already been said...<br /><br />Let me tell you a story about a small, 11 year old boy.  I loved to read and loved fantasy books the most.  My school would occasionally hand out pamphlets full of age appropriate books for kids to order.  I looked through and came upon a bundle of three books, the first three in the Harry Potter series.  Something about the picture or the little blurb about i must have piqued my interest because I promptly ordered them, and devoured them when they arrived.  I immediately fell in love with the series and simply could not wait for the next to arrive. As every book came out I quickly re-read all the previous books and the latest (I believe i'm at about 15+ reads on the first).  In between every release I eagerly waited and waited for the next.  I would go on the website, visit the forums, read through fan theories, talk about them with my sister, who also dearly loved the series.  With every wait my brain would go crazy with anticipation for the next.<br /><br />Finally the last book.  So many good memories, so many questions.  It felt like a very fulfilling resolution.  I was sad it was over, that there was no more to this world that I would every find out about again.  But while that did sadden me, I still felt good having read it, having experienced it growing up.  Luckily there were those small books about Fantastical Beast, Quidditch, and childrens' tales, which are small but nice and I would highly recommend them.<br /><br />Pssst - there's also going to be another book in the wizarding universe, just a different time period, can't wait!  I'm going to go crazy!
