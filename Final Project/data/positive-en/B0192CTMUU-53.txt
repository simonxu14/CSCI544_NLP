Why are you even reading this review?  You either love or loathe Harry Potter--there's no in between.  This series of books (GOF being #4 in the series) will suck you into it's clutches if you let it and never let go.  I think all of the books are absolutely amazing (and I'm 23 years old, so they're are NOT just for kids--there are plenty of adults that read them too).<br /><br />As for this particular book, I think this is when the series takes a turning point and really starts to get interesting.  In the first and second books, there's a lot of what I'll call "happy fun magic tricks" going on--the characters are kids just learning their abilities and playing around.  The third book starts to dive deeper into the storyline and you start to learn a lot about Harry, but the fourth book is when the real adventure begins.  The war between good and evil truly begins again with the climax of this book and Harry learns just how much danger he is in.  It's a must read---just buy it you know you want to.
