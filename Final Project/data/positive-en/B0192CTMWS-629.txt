12 hours. That's how long it was between the time I found the Amazon package this morning, as though left by an owl, and the time I turned the last page in this incredible book. If you've read the first four Harry Potter books, I don't need to sell you on this. If you're just looking for a little more info before you order, consider this:<br />There is more action and surprise in just the first three chapters of this book than in the first three books in this series combined.<br />By the end you're left feeling that you know more than ever before, but that there are still mysteries to be solved.<br />Incidental characters become increasingly important, with one in particular earning a degree of honor and respect you'd never have imagined.<br />It's almost impossible to discuss this book, because I would never want to ruin even a bit of it for someone who hasn't read it yet. It's clear why this book took three years to write. There's so much going on, so much meat... snippets of humor dovetailing into pure terror, high fantasy mixed with in-depth social structure, characters rising to become heroes and others falling to darkness or ignorance. This is a book that will require multiple readings to take it all in. Which is fortunate, because it may be some time before we discover what lies next. Your heart will, in turns, soar, break and be filled with resolve.<br />I can't even fathom what comes next.
