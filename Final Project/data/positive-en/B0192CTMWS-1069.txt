My 9 year old dove into this complex plot full of detail and twists and riddles and could not put it down.  I was the same way.  We passed it back and forth over the course of a week or so.  This was my favorite, though we loved the whole series.<br /><br />THANK YOU Ms. Rowling for not copping out with an ambiguous ending.  The biggest fans are kids, and you were so good to your readers in putting such great work into forming an action packed, satisfying, ending that made sense, even though it was not predictable.<br /><br />Awesome read!
