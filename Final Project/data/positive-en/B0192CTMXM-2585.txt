I wanted to put in a word on this little known book ; ) What hasn't been said? Probably nothing, but all I can say, as a father and teacher is that Joanne Rowling is a wonderful storyteller. She has woven her tale beautifully and this adult loves to read these books as much as any kid. So does my wife. I think re-reading is in order this summer! Keep 'em coming Ms. Rowling please, we just hope we don't have to wait too long...
