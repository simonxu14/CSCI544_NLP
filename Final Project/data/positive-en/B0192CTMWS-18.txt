I was so excited to get my book, I had to put aside my 15 page term paper to read #5.  I finished it in 3 days and was thoroughly pleased.  I have to agree it was dark, but to see Harry and the gang have normal teenagers problems was refreshing.  I love seeing Ginny Weasley having more of a character, too.  You must read the previous four to be able to read this, though.  Can't wait fot the next book!!
