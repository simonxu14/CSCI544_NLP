The latest Harry Potter book was fabulous, as expected.  I find myself constantly surprised at how involved I feel in Rowling's books... what a great author, to be able to please children, as well as their parents.  This book would most likely prove scary and confusing to smaller children, as it deals quite a bit with corruption in government and realistically menacing characters, but older kids will love it and will enjoy the suspense.  A hefty book at 870 pages,I found myself torn between wanting to read it as fast as I could (and did) and wishing I'd gone more slowly so that the magic would last just a little bit longer...a few less days in between finishing this book and beginning the next one.
