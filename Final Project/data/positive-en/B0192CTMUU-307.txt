I found this to be a wonderful transitional book.  The doors are now open with lots of intricate plot threads hanging for future novels.  There is no denying that this is an intense book that deals with difficult issues.  I  believe the young readers will be better for the exposure and the skillful  handling of these issues.<br />This book has wide appeal....even to 32 year  old Muggles.
