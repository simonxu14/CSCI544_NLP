Harry Potter and the deathly Hallows has one of the greatest endings to one of the most famed books in our time. Keeps you wanting more but alas this ending to this wonderful story is the perfect to end my fantasy land of Harry Potter. Like so many others who have fallen in love with these series I also have slipped and fallen into its magical world every time I read them. DO NOT read this if you have not read the others, it will completely defeat its purpose. No, if you are a newcomer then you must encounter the journey we fellow fans have gone through. This book is fantastic and it is so much more than a story.
