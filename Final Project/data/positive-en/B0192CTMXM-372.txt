There was no doubt in my mind that this book would be amazing from beginning to end. Needless to say I was not wrong in the least. I love how the book came shipped in a muggles do not open before package and was full of great surprises. As most Harry Potter fans I could not keep my nose out of this delightful book. Who wants to leave the house? J. K. Rowling is an amazing author who dreamed something up and turned it into something that many will remember for years.<br /><br />I guarantee you will love this book almost as much as you love your 2007 Ferrari :)
