That's the best word I can come up with the describe the book.<br /><br />I resisted, see.  My wife always wanted me to read the books... I preferred to stick to more 'mature' books, such as Goodkind's Sword of Truth series, Tolkein of course, Jordan's Wheel of Time, the many story arcs of Fiest's Midkemian crew, and some of Brook's and Farland's books.<br /><br />I resisted.  I watched the first 3 movies, with my wife of course... I mean, I wouldn't want her to go to the movies alone, right?<br /><br />And then, in secret, I read the Goblet of Fire.  Incredible book.  One of the better ones I've ever read.  Intersting.  It seems I wasn't giving the author enough credit.  She can spin a tale, yes?<br /><br />Then I read the order of the Phoenix.  Decent book, felt a bit unfocused to me... I attributed it to the fact that I was just glimpsing into the world, not truly a rabid fan.  Over a year passed.  I bought my wife the next book, and she read it, but I wasn't really interested... so time passes until... last Friday, I went out to see the movie, Order of the Phoenix.  It really was a good adaptation, I felt.. for being as compressed as it was, it presented the story quite well, with a few(troubling) differences that I didn't really understand.<br /><br />I came home, and the next day our preorder of the final book came from Amazon.  I opened it up and looked at the cover... but I couldn't really read them out of order, really..  The Half Blood Prince was staring at me on the bookshelf.  So I  read it.  In one setting.  Took about 7 hours.  Great read.  I then took a moment for a bite to eat, and started The Deathly Hallows.<br /><br />I lost consciousness about halfway through, and just finished it today, while 'sort of' watching the British Open.<br /><br />Brilliant read.  The books has everything in it.  I won't breathe a word of the plot, but I have to say, hat's off to you, Rowling.  Good show.  Thanks very much.
