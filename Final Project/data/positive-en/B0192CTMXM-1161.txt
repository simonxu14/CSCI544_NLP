Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a nonstop page turner. It enthralls you from page one and takes you right back into the story of Harry and his friends going up against Lord Voldemort. I would suggest this book to anyone who has read the series and I would suggest the series to anyone who has not read any of the books. Even if you have seen the movies the books are worth reading.
