Another installment of adventure and fantasy, delightful characters,  rivetting battles between good and evil. While I find it difficult to believe those who think HP &quot;promotes&quot; witchcraft and deviltry have actually read the books, I would note a word of warning for parents of the young or sensitive readers of any age that the verbally graphic depiction of one character cutting off his own hand to make a blood sacrifice to resurrect another is truly a tense and frightening passage that may well produce nightmares.  Please note this is an evil character doing what is clearly presented as an evil thing,and bravery and goodness do prevail.<br />These are not simple books.  Adults read them for your own enjoyment - and to guide your children.
