I was itching to get this after I finished book 6 and I wasn't disappointed.  Since reading the book and watching the movies, the books are so much better. The first part of the movie for this book was pretty good, am hoping they don't mess up the 2nd part.<br /><br />The book wrapped up very nicely to end the series, I was happy with it.
