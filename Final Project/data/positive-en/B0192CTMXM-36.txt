Two months ago if you asked me which Harry Potter book I liked best, I would have to have said book 1.  Now, though, without a doubt, it's book 5.  I was a bit disappointed in book 4, and had a hard time staying interested in it.  Indeed, I began to feel as if the "magic" was wearing off.  Therefore, I was a little concerned about how good book 5 would be.  I shouldn't have worried. I, personally, found the 5th installment of Harry Potter to be far more interesting, engaging, and intense than book 4.  Yes, Harry is more self-involved than before, and comes off as a petulant, grumpy teen at times...but I chalk that up to teenage angst and think it only serves to make him seem more "realistic."  Up to now Harry has basically been a pretty happy kid, despite all the bad things in his life, but in this book we see him struggle with deeper and more negative emotions.  I, for one, appreciated seeing this more "human" side of Harry.  Also, I must compliment Ms. Rawlings on her choice of character names in this book.  The house elf "Kreacher" (I assume meaning creature), and especially Professor "Umbridge" (who literally takes umbrage at everything Harry says or does).  Clever play on words!  As lengthy as this book is, I still was disappointed to reach the end.  I thoroughly enjoyed every moment I spent reading it, and only hope it isn't another 3 years before the next one comes out!
