ATTN: SPOILERS…. First of all – who is this Harry Potter?!  This was recommended to me once I finished reading Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.  I didn’t know until half way through that this was the second book in the series.  That would have filled in a lot of the blanks for me, but nonetheless…mind blown.  I haven’t felt this way since Apple removed the head phone jack from the iphone 7. Like what?!  A hidden school for witches and wizards to train! Dark Lords! Ghosts! Snake language! Elves! Owls that deliver mail (warning, doesn’t work in real life #disappointed #feathers everywhere)! What more can someone ask for… This is like Alice in Wonderland meets Hocus Pocus meets Twilight meets Mean Girls (Crabe, Goyle, and Malfoy). I cannot wait to read the first one and come to find out there are several more!  What’s going to happen to Harry Potter and his friends?!  The anticipation is killing me!  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a page turner, edge of your seat adventure.
