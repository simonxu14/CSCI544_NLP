5 stars because lets face it, who doesn't like Harry Potter. I bought this book for my 6 year old who is currently very into wizards and magic. It arrived a day late but that was due to Hurricane Mathew. The package was not damaged and the book was in perfect shape! We did finish this book and have moved on to book 2.
