This book is gorgeous! I love seeing the illustrations and it's fun for my 4 and 6 year olds to have something to look at while I'm reading to them. The pictures are beautiful, and the book is really good sized, I was surprised when the UPS man delivered the box - it was heavy!! I cant wait for the other books to come out illustrated.
