This was just as good as any of the Harry Potter series. I got it on Saturday, when it was released, and didn't put it down until i finished it.  It took me less than 2 days to read all 700+ pages. It is just as  captivating and as magical as the first three novels. I can't wait for the  next one!  It is a little sad and a little scary, but it is great! If  you have not read the Harry Potter series, I sugest you start, but start  with the first one. Reading them out of order would be confusing. I don't  care how old you are, I am nearly 17, and love them, and both of my  parents, 47 and 48, love them as well. They are NOT just children's books!
