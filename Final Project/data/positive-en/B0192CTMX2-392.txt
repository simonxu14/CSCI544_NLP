I've read twice, cover to cover, and I expect that from time to time, I'll go back and pick it up.  Loved the entire Potter series, having shared it with my daughter from ages 8 to 18, and look forward to sharing it with my grandchildren.  No matter what JK does in the future, nothing will ever take away her genius in this series.  One of the best stories, 1 to 7, ever written!
