This was DEFINITELY the BEST Harry Potter book!  I'm 16 w/ a college reading level and i absolutely LOVE Harry Potter!  There's a type of intriguing air about the books.  WARNING: once you start reading it you'll never be able to stop!  There's plenty of mystery, adventure, and humor.  Even if you didn't really like the first three you should LOVE this!
