this book is fantastic everyone i know who has read them loves them and everyone else should read them. the author is very talented in the way she sculpts the stories, adding seemingly unimportant details that late rpop up in future books (memebr sorcerers stone? remember how hagrid showed up to drop off harry on a motor bike, and he siad he'd borrowed it from &quot;young sirius black&quot;? i'd forgotten that, but come book 3...) my school is not allowed to read them because some parents think they're evil, so now NO ONE can read them at school. which is seriously unfair, as they're all about FIGHTING evil, not promoting it. anyway they rock.
