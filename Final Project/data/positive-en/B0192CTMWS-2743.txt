I am a passionate fan of J.K. Rowling's, and like most of her readers, I waited with bated breath for this final installment of her wonderful series!  I knew early on that Rowling was writing Christian allegory, so a few of the surprises were expected.  Without ruining these twists and turns for others who haven't had the pleasure yet, I'll just say that Rowling remains consistent with her allegory, and yet she wisely chooses not to perfect it, allowing her characters to retain their humanity.  The writing has a little bit of a hurried quality, as if, having worked so hard to reach this point, Rowling really wanted to just have it over with.  And I was a bit disappointed with the ending for a few of the characters I'd become attached to, as they didn't get quite the attention that I wanted to give them.  But she gives us a solid conclusion to all of the major storylines, and wraps everything off nicely.  I highly recommend this book and the whole series - it definitely deserves a place beside the Chronicles of Narnia and the Lord of the Rings Trilogy in the annals of classic Christian writing.  Those who have demonized Rowling were completely off the mark.  I do think that there are some legitimate concerns that young kids reading these books might be attracted to some of the occult arts talked about in the books, which are forbidden in the Bible.  But I also think that Rowling is, ultimately, speaking Parseltongue, using the language of serpents to speak to those who would never listen to doves.  I commend her, and hope that her efforts bear fruit!
