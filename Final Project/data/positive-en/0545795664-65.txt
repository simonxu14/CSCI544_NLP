Got this for my little guy. He is pretty obsessed with pokemon right now and loves to read so its a great bridge between the video game that he loves and reading. I am sure I will know every fact about every pokemon in the very near future. The book itself has great pictures and facts about each pokemon. It is also organized by type of pokemon, so you can easily reference it while you are playing the game.
