This book is beautiful! It is the first book in the Harry Potter Series ! A must for every Harry Potter Fan! The illustrations are by Jim Kay, and they are spectacular! The actual book is also inside, it's not all pics! These will come out every year until the whole series is done, I can't wait! What a beautiful edition to anyone's bookshelf!
