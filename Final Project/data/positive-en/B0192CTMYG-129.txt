There has been a lot of fuss about &quot;satanic&quot; elements in the Harry Potter novels, so I was careful to read this book before passing it along to my nephew as a Christmas gift.  Frankly, I didn't find any reason for concern: the book is very much in the tradition of such children's classics as Baum's Oz novels, which have featured witches, sorcerers, goblins and the like without ever once being accused of satanic overtones.<br />The major difference between such as the Oz books and Harry Potter is that Oz--and others like it--are set in a completely imaginary world, while Harry Potter is not.  While this is probably the very thing that its detractors find most upsetting, it is actually the very thing that makes the book so much fun to read, for its fantasy elements take on a literal quality that allow for the willing suspension of disbelief in a way not previously seen in books written for children.  It is a very sophisticated bit of writing, and I look forward to reading the other books in the series myself.<br />These are not, by the way, books written for young children.  Most six and seven year olds will be completely out of their depth.  They are more appropriate to the ten-year-old and over crowd, who will have less difficulty reading them on their own.
