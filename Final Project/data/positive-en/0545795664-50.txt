My 3 boys have never been into Pokemon very  much.  Now with the Pokemon Go craze they have increased interest.  This book is great.  They are able to look through the very colorful pages and find the Pokemon characters that they are capturing and they are able to learn more about each one.  They have even started a wish list of who they want to capture.  My boys are ages 7 to 10 and they even help their little 4 year old sister reading from the book.  This keeps their interest and encourages them to read.
