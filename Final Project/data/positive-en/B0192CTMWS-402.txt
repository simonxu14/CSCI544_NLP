Once again J.K. Rowling wove her spell and produced the final chapter in Harry's life.  Harry learns valuable lessons of friendship and trusting in yourself and your destiny to over come the biggest obsticle we all face, death.  The book held my interest throughout and was hard to put down (even though my son was anxiously waiting for me to finish reading it so that he could read it also).  This book is a definite "must read" for all readers.
