The Seventh (dare we say 'the last'?) Harry Potter novel is a triumphant conclusion to what everyone has to admit is a colossal undertaking. I read it with excitement and wonder, for in this story Rowling completes the cycle of the six archetypes that she sets up for Harry in book one. He moves, in these books, through all six archetypes of personal growth - the same ones that recur in all the great books of the Western Canon over the last 3000 years.<br />  What does this mean?  Well, in book 1 Harry starts off as an Innocent (stage 1), and it is this quality that helps him survive Voldemort's attack.  When we meet him he's truly an Orphan (stage 2) at the Dursleys'.  He is then taken off to Hogwarts where he goes to the next stage (stage 3) as a Pilgrim-after-Truth (remember, he's a Seeker in quidditch, which is a neat echo). Working his way through the mystery he has to be both a Pilgrim and show his courage for what he believes in - a real Warrior in fact(stage 4).  He shows his true value when he retrieves the Philosopher's stone even though he has no desire for it himself, which is the mark of the Monarch (stage 5) - working for others without being dominated by selfish ego needs. And, remember, it's this essential unselfishness that makes him the only person who can hold the stone - a true Magician (stage 6).<br />  If you've followed this so far, you'll see that Harry completes a trajectory through all six archetypes, but at a low level - a bit like Ordinary Wizarding Level exams, they're the highest he can attain at that time.  But Rowling shows him going through the same sequence EACH year, and each time at a slightly higher level. Each year the struggle against Voldemort gets a little harder. Finally, In volume 7 he learns to unite the Magician with the Innocent (stages 1 and 7) which will make him truly a complete Magician - wise and humble, powerful and modest.<br />  I know of no other writer who even comes close to attempting this, and in doing so Rowling has placed this cycle of novels on a par with the Odyssey, the Oresteia, and the works of Shakespeare in terms of what she can tell us about the growth of the psyche.<br />  If you want more details of this theory take a look at "Stories We Need to Know; Redaing Your Life Path in Literature"<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Stories-We-Need-to-Know-Reading-Your-Life-Path-in-Literature/dp/1844091236/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Stories We Need to Know: Reading Your Life Path in Literature</a>&nbsp;You can also take a look at my webpage [...]
