One thing that annoyed me about the early HP series was the run-on sentences and odd punctuation. The books got deeper and more clever as the series went on. I think that Book 7 just exemplifies how J.K. Rowling has flourished. This book isn't completely predictable and the thought patterns are just amazing. I was really impressed that a novel that has thus far been geared toward young adults could take such a giant intellectual leap in the last book.<br /><br />In short, it's not as simplistic as the other books (while I do celebrate the entire collection). Very engaging read for all ages.
