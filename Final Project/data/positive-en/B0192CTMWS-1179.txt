Like the other 6 I loved this book, it does a pretty fantastic job rapping up the series in a satisfying way.  Having said that, what I really loved about the other books, especially 1-4, was that the kids were investigating mysteries and taking classes and competing in quidditch matches - and fighting Voldemort of course.  This book lacks those types of charming moments, but is fantastic in other ways.
