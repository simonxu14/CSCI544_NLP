the book is full of fun, mystery, and adventure. I would recommed this book, and the other three, to people of all ages. It was so exiting I could hardly put it down. Even if you have a little kid you could read aloud some  of the book every night. I'm sure both of you would  enjoy it. J.K.Rowling  has to be one of the most talented authors in the world. I can't wait till  the next book comes out.
