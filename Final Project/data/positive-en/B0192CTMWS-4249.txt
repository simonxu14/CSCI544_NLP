Fast read, good pacing, exciting at times, sad at times, but I think JK caved in to pressures from publishers to do this ending the way she did.  The Epilogue was superfluous and left me rolling my eyes.  Majority of kids' Brit. lit is always dark and leaves you with lots of questions and the majority of the main characters gone to the Grey Havens or Overland with Aslan).  I would have rather the series stayed dark than turn light.  Great book, but not the best in the series.
