The only problem that I see after finishing this book, is the possibility that Harry Potter will no longer exist in print. As anxious as I was to finish the book, I'm saddened to realize that this might be an end to the fabulous run J. K. Rowling has had with this series. It was phenomenal, even for this 55-year-old! Bravo and best wishes. Read, read, read and please give us more!
