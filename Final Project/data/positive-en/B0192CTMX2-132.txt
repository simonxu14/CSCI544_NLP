This may be my favorite of the Harry Potter early books because of the depth of the character development and the backstory.  If I had to pick three of the books, for anyone to read, it would be this, HP and the Half Blood Prince, and HP and the Deathly Hallows.<br /><br />All of her books are well written, but this shows so much heart, and illuminates so much of the histories of her characters.  Don't miss it.
