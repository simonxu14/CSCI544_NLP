I am a 34 year old woman, normally like classics and don't find most modern books worth glancing at.  For that matter, I never read kids books, certainly, except a few years ago I picked up Harry Potter 1 just to see why the big commotion.  I was impressed.<br /><br />I've since read Book 2 and recently I read Book 3, Prisoner of Azkaban.  I would say that Azkaban is the best yet, although one can certainly argue how can one be more perfect than perfectipn?<br /><br />The superiority of the Azkaban lies in:<br /><br />1.  superior imagination - a magical bus that runs wildly but never hits things because the things "jump" away automatically; the boggart that assumes the form of one's worst fear; the map that shows every secret path and the location of everybody at any time.<br /><br />2.  watertight plot.  Even Ron's worthless rat that nobody would ever give a thought of carries unexpected weight in this story; every odd incident is explained naturally smoothly, and every explanation makes perfect sense.<br /><br />3.  well-arranged mysteries gradually introduced and explained at the proper time.<br /><br />4.  amazing character development.  Professor Lupin is such a lovable teacher, whereas the dementors can chill even the reader's bones, not only Harry's!<br /><br />As always, the book is so well-written (albeit simple) that the language alone makes it a joy to read.  I find it inconceivable that any one human being can write as perfect a book as this, but Rowling has written quite a few.  In comparison to the C.S. Lewis's Narnia series, for example, I think Harry Potter is  better in that the stories are more complex (yet perfectly lucid for even children).  The more complex a story is, the harder it is to make the storyline watertight, but Azkaban not only fit into itself perfectly, it fits the previous books seamlessly as well.<br /><br />Rowling is a genius compared to geniuses.
