So well done, I broked down and got the rest of the audio books.  What a wonderful treasure for long trips and just sitting back and enjoying the magic.  Some great tidbits that weren't covered in the movie, it still conjures of many of the wonderful images from the movie.  I have listened to all of them twice since I bought this first one.
