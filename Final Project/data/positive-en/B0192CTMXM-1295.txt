I think Harry Potter, Order of the Phoenix was very informative, but not as exciting as Book 3 or 4.  It started kind of slowly, and some of the side storylines were not that interested.  However, we learned a lot about Harry's past, and he grew up a lot.  I also think Hermione and Neville grew up a lot.
