The story seems to wend its way slowly through plot points (or lack thereof--I did agree with Ron at one point in the story, and after reading you'll know what I mean), and the slow-ish plot can sometimes be a bit tiring.  It didn't provide me with a lot of excitement when big plot points occurred, but maybe that was just me.<br /><br />I won't say anything as to the deaths alluded to before the book's release except that I was sad at most of them; also I thought there would be only two, but there were way more deaths of good characters than that.<br /><br />I also enjoyed how JK Rowling brought in a lot of details and people from the previous six books--it was like a farewell tv show where they look back on the best times, people who were on over the years, and things like that.  JKR always did a good job of that, but I think it's much more prominent in this book than in any, and I think that was stylistically intentional.<br /><br />Overall, the book was, I felt, enjoyable and interesting, engaging even when the plot seemed slow or a little directionally challenged, and I was very satisfied with the ending.<br /><br />Parents should be warned:  the death toll racks up quickly, and the language also is ramped up a bit.  There is use of a couple of "B" words and perhaps a couple of other curse words, so be warned.  I think other than that, language is relatively tame.
