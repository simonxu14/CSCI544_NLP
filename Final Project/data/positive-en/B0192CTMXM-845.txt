This was the first of the Harry Potter books I have ever read.  I am deployed over seas, saw it in the library, liked the movies and knew this one was coming out to the theaters soon so I read it.  Great book.  I was sorry to see the movie did it little justice and left so much out.  Mrs Rowling really does a great job transporting us into her imagination and the story and this was a fantastic read.  I certainly recommend it to any potter fans.  If you have never seen the movies before or read the books preceeding this one, then I would start at the beginning.  It is a good place to start.  Since reading this I have burned through Half Blood Prince and am about to finish the Deathly Hallows.  I have not been this addicted to a series since the Dragonlance Chronicles and Blood of Kerensky Trilogy and highly recommend it to anybody who enjoys fantasy, fiction, and certainly the Potter saga.
