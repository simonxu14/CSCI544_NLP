Such a delightful tale. I can see why people are enamored by it. Magic, witches, dragons, evil doer's and even little dragons. Having seen the movies already, some of the book felt repetitive, but the books gave you so much more than the movie ever could. While the writing is juvenile for this middle aged woman, it was still a delightful and fun read. I hope I get my letter to Hogwart's soon, as I am officially a Potterhead.
