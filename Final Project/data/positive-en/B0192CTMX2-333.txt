I can't believe I'm reading these books at all....a co-worker convinced me to buy the first book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  This isn't my type of book, I'm more into murder mysteries.  So I bought the book, but it took me awhile to pick it up and start reading.  I was dreading it, actually.  I thought it would just drag on and on, and it would take forever to get through it.  Well, that isn't the case at all....I got hooked on the first book!  I ordered the next three, and I'm now in the middle of Goblet of Fire.  I'm about 15 years late, but I guess better late than never.....I'm 59 years young!  By the way, I just ordered the last three!
