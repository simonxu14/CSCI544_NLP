As a crossword/Scrabble junkie, I really enjoy the way Rowling uses language.  We meet Sirius and Professor Lupin in book 3, see if you can figure out what their names tell the reader about their true natures.  I couldn't wait to read the book, and become enveloped in another adventure at Hogwarts.  Rowling hasn't disappointed this 37-year-old teenager yet.
