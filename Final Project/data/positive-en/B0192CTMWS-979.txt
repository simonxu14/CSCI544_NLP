In short: read the book!<br />It's hard to give a good review of the book without spoiling it. The book has a rather gloomy feel to it, as if Dementors are nearby as you read. Things feel hopeless for Harry and everyone else at Hogwarts, even. "Poisoned honey" does not even BEGIN to describe the new DADA teacher, she's just pure evil. Ashcroft has nothing on this woman.<br />Dumbledore does answer many of the questions that Harry and his fans have had about why He-Who-Must-Not-Named is after Harry to begin with, but I was left with many more questions instead. Hopefully, some of those will be answered in the next two books, which I am now eagerly awaiting.
