As soon as I started Book 7, I could not put it down. Sure, it's a little long, and as in her other books, Rowling could stand to tighten up her writing a little..but the plot line is still compelling and there are enough plausible twists and turns to keep the reader interested and unable to stop reading. There will be no plot spoilers here, however, in my opinion, Mrs. Weasley becomes the unsung heroine of the book, especially when she utters her memorable quote in the 2nd to last chapter...a quote not necessarily meant for the young. For those who are upset with the more adult themes in this book, Rowling's writing, themes, characters, and plotlines have all matured along with the readers who have stuck through the entire series since it's beginning. Nice job!
