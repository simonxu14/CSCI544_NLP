This book is, in my opinion, much better than the previous book (book 4), but still pales to the first book and is probably comparable to the others.  Everything seems so black and white in these books, but the author is starting to play too much upon this type of theme (good versus evil) instead of what made the series interesting in the first place (anticipation, the unknown, reasoning and solving skills, characters who felt that they were real people in real relationships - not unrealistic ones, as well as all the nifty creative ideas that makes this story much more unique than that of other series).  Many of us can identify with some of these characters.  Hagrid - the big caring brother for example (I sort of miss him, wished he was in here more).  Peeves, the jokester.  In these recent books, however, the character interactions are becoming too simple and too linear (and in my opinion, too unrealistic).  Some of these characters, unlike the previous book, also get on your nerves sometimes (Harry with his temper tantrums, Hermione with her know-it-all I'm always right attitude, Ms Weasley the control freak).  I wouldn't have minded this, however, if the relationships were real.  But people aren't reacting to them in a realistic manner.<br />Also Hogwarts felt like a fun place to be in some of the previous books, but in this book it felt like you were going to well -school.  Instead of escaping to a place a wonder and discovery from a dull home - now you're going to school from a dull home.  Luckily the pace picks up at the end, and it turns out into the book it was meant to be.  If she had gotten rid of the slow parts of the book and made the book shorter, then it would have been a better book.
