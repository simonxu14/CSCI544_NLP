I loved this book! It is perfect for a blossoming Pokemon fan like me. It has all Pokemon I can think of inside - even Sylveon, Eevee's new evolution form. All the pictures are really great, except for a view of a Larvitus, or rather, the top of its head. Sort of annoying. But everything else is nice, especially a cool pic of Glaceon. This book has all the facts I'd want to know about the Pokemon inside.<br />Everything is perfect, except that there is a picture of a Fearow in place of a Spearow. That's okay, though, because Spearow are so common I know them like the back of my hand. :) And this book doesn't have all the Legendary Pokemon listed in the back like the first one, but that's okay too.<br />I am very happy and pleased!<br /><br />-An eleven-year-old girl
