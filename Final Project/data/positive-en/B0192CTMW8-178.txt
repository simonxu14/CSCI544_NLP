The first book was good.  BUT, this one was even better.  Whatmore can happen to Harry Potter?  I laughed out loud; I say &quot;OhNo&quot; several times.  This is wonderful writing.  I like how the author refreshes people on things from the first book by very briefly describing again what they are. Can't wait for #3.
