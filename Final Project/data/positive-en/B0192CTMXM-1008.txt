I read the book over 15 days. A few parts brought tears to my eyes, not because of a character's death, but due to the discovery of certain emotional truths. Love and respect is shown to another character or someone discovers a great piece of wisdom. An important aspect of the story is good versus evil, and the proper fighting tactics that decent people use that show they are morally superior to the others.<br /><br />Harry barely escapes capture or death many times. A lot of characters are killed off, including good and bad wizards and witches and also several muggles. There is a focus on the life of Albus Dumbledore.
