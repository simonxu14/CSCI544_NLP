If you haven't read the first two books in the Harry Potter series, don't consider this until then.<br />This book was awesome! The details are really creative and the plot is put together superbly. I really enjoyed this book. I had to read it in like three days and I was up till like 2-3am each night (I had to force myself to sleep). This is a book fun for even adults. If you have the slightest interest in magic and/or fantasy, this is for you. The book is clever enough to surprise the brightest of adults. If you're even considering it (as you are by reading this review), I know you'll enjoy it.
