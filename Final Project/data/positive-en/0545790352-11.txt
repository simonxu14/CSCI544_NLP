As a huge Harry Potter fan, I was a little worried I was going to be disappointed by the artwork and would not live up to my expectations, however I was happily surprised. The quality of the artwork is incredible. An extra bonus to me, the characters are not based off of the movie, and instead is more along the lines of what I originally imagined. I would highly recommend to any Harry Potter fan.<br /><br />There are pictures every few pages, and the photos I uploaded do not do them justice.<br /><br />Plus, my three year old is now enamored with Harry Potter, and that's always a plus :)
