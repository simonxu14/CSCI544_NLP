Wow, what a great book!  I have read all of the HP books and this is by far the best.  This is one of those books you just can't put down.  The language in this book is a little more difficult than the previous 4, but there is so much action it just keeps moving.  As a teacher, I would say the reading level of this book is about 6th grade.  It is definitely not as scary and bloody as the 4th book.  Younger students could read it but may have difficulty with some vocabulary.  I hope JK does not wait 2 years for the next book...I might go crazy.<br />John Kashka
