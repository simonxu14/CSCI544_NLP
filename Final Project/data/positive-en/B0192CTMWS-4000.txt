Having pored for hours over the last 6 books and having spent so much time reading the theories on Mugglenet, there were still enough twists in the last book to keep me enthralled. Some of the theories came close to the truth, only because JKR had given us several clues in the previous books, and some fans guessed better than the rest of us.<br /><br />This book more than others showed us clearly that everyone has shades of gray in them given their motivations and the circumstances that surround them. That is what I like about this final book, it is clear in this book more than before that none of her heroes or villains are perfect, they are given to doubts and misgivings just like the rest of us. The outcome is determined through the choices her characters make at each point and through the trust they choose to place in others. JKR does not condescend to her younger tween audience to show a black and white world of good and evil, instead she gives them a glimpse of the murky grayness that lives in every character and  demonstrates how our choices finally make us who we are. Books that I read before I was high school age helped shape my thougt and morality, and I applaud the philosophy JKR puts forth in her books as a parent.
