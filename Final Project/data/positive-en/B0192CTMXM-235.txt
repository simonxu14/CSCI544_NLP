Without giving to much away, this book was not at all what I expected. I loved it!! Although it didn't end as I thought.. the ending was a perfect way to end the series. The book takes you through the lives of many of the characters that Rowling has been writing about all along and it all ties together. I Highly recommend the whole Harry Potter series to anyone. I'm going to miss the Harry Potter stories, and I am really sad it all had to come to an end.
