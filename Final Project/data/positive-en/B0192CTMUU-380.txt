My 12 and 14 year-old children loved it.  My husband and I loved it.  Readers all over the world loved it.  But I firmly believe our recent 10 year-old will appreciate it more if he waits a year or two.  Will I stop  him from trying?  No.  He will enjoy much of the book and wants to keep up  with his siblings.  But this fourth book is much more complicated and  disturbing, more frightening and grotesque, more gory and eerie than  anything my 10 year-old has experienced on screen or between the pages.  I  am an English teacher and believe in challenging children's limits for  reading levels and experiences.  My son will not be harmed if he finishes  the book, but he will probably be quite perplexed and more than a little  scared.  He will probably work on reading it, but we won't press him, and  he may be daunted by the page length.  SO, if you're a mom wondering  whether to get this for a 10 year old or younger, you might hold off.  There's always next year.
