Overall, a very solid book.  As with the other books in the series, it starts off slow, with vivid descriptions of Harry's vacation away from Hogwarts.  But, soon enough, he is off having brand new adventures, and misadventures with his friends, and foes.  A much darker tone to this book.  It will be hard for Mrs. Rowling to cram together the last two years of Harry's ordeals at Hogwarts, into only two books!!  Best of luck to you J.K.!
