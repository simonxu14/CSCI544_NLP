I've been eagerly looking forward to this book and dreading it at the same time.  The Harry Potter universe is fascinating and I hope that JKR recuperates from this book soon and starts the Wizarding Encyclopedia.  There was a lot of action in this book, and a lot of loss of beloved characters. Some of the losses were dealt with so quickly, that the impact wasn't immediately felt.  Perhaps this is because they were still in danger at that point.  I don't want to spoil the book for those who haven't read it yet, but I really loved how some of the "fuzzier" witches and wizards stepped up to the plate.  I'm talking to you Neville, Molly Weasley and Professor Trelawney.  I also hope the next 2 movies include Bill and Fleur.  As for the epilogue, it answered some questions, but left a lot of others unanswered.  I saw an interview with JKR where she said she had trimmed it down, but she still has all her notes.  Hopefully, her encyclopedia will let us know who's running Hogwarts, where all our favorite Gryffindors ended up (besides our heroic trio) and how the Wizarding World is faring in this century.
