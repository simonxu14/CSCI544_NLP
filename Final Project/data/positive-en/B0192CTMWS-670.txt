"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" culminates Rowling's wonderful series, but I wish it didn't.  I have loved every book in this series; and it makes me sad that no more about Harry Potter will be coming to us from Rowling's genius.  The books in this series have been growing darker and scarier with each installment.  This last installment continues the trend.  It made me sad to lose so many beloved characters to death in the Harry Potter series; but the fact that some of our favorite characters must die in the war against Voldemort does lend reality and credibility to the story.  I would like it if Rowling now ventured further into the back-stories of some of the other characters in Harry Potter's world -- like maybe Dumbledore.  We get glimpses of Dumbledore's youth in "Deathly Hallows" -- enough to pique my curiosity and whet my appetite for more.<br /><br />I have only one slight criticism of this novel:  The epilogue rubbed me a little bit the wrong way.  Rather than telling us that Harry and his surviving friends lived happily ever after, I wish Rowling had ended this episode with the victory over Voldemort, and would now go on to tell us about Harry's further adventures with magic in future episodes.  But I suppose all authors get tired of their characters -- even if the rest of us don't!
