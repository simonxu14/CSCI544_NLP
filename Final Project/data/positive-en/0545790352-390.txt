This book looks and feels amazing. The detail in all of the illustrations is fantastic and the pages feel very durable and high quality. The price was also an amazing deal, saw this a Target for $32 and got it here on Amazon for $24. If you are a Harry Potter fan this book will be a great addition to your bookshelf, I kind of want to get a second one just to keep on my shelf and use the other to read from.
