My hubby loves to read but being a truck driver he does not have the time. So I purchased the books on CD for him and he says that it helps him get hundreds of miles down the road. He has seen the movies but did not realize how much more was in the books and now can see how the all add up. He loves the product. I ordered the Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix for his birthday.
