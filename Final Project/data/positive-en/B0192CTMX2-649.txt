It's been a couple of years since I last read "Harry," and I'd forgotten a few things.  I should have re-read "The Goblet of Fire" before starting this new book, since I drew a few blanks every now and again when the author reminded the reader of events that had taken place in the last installment.  I had even forgotten several (minor) characters names and had to look 'em up at some point.  Having mentioned that, I must say that this book was quite good, but pretty sinister.  I got tired of the bickering amongst Harry, Hermione and Ron, but really enjoyed the Fred and George Weasley exploits.  I really think I like those two characters best of all.  I plowed through this newest epic in one weekend because I got caught up in the narration.  There's an awful lot of "stuff" crammed into these pages, and the pace is often hectic.  Oddly enough, I was left somewhat detached and not affected by the one character's death, though I was surprised at which one did die.  I've since gone back to re-read parts, just for fun.  I just get the feeling that there was an awful lot of hype about this book and I wonder if it was all worth it.  I'm also not sure if this is the best book yet, but it was good reading, anyway.  I hope Harry doesn't turn into a more obnoxious teenager than he is right now.  A little more respect for his elders might be a good thing.
