What a wonderful book!  I ordered it simply because I needed to see what the phenonomen was about.  (I understood it less than even Pokemon!)  And much to my suprise, I could not put the book down for two straight days.  It is a marvelous fairy tale, filled with contagious characters and  Rowling's exquisite details!  I recommend this book for anyone of any age.  It's a keeper--and a classic.
