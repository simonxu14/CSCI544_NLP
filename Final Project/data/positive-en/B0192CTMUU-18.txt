I'm reading through the Harry Potter books for the first time (I'm slow, I know!). I'm enjoying them, immensely! I think I have a particular advantage, because after many years of reading aloud to my son (age 18), he's now reading this series aloud to me. It's a ton of fun, as he puts different voices with the different characters, etc.
