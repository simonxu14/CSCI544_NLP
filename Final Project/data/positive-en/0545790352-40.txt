Mine came today and I'm so happy!  It's incredibly beautiful illustrations and there are so many!  I was expecting maybe 1-2 illustrations per chapter but there's an illustration on almost every single page!  It's like seeing the Harry Potter series again for the very first time.  *tear*  I purchased 2 more to build sets for my nieces for down the road when they are old enough to appreciate the books.
