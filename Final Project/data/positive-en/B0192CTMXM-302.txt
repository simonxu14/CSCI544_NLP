I have loved all of the Harry Potter books, but this has been my favorite.  Yes, it has been darker than the earlier books, but it pulled everything together in a complete and compelling way.  I now understand so much more about many of the characters and the situation that Harry has been in since the initial attack by Voldemort.  I was moved to tears at times, and felt the odds against Harry and his friends were so insurmountable that I was overwhelmed for them.  Yet there were unknown helpers along the way, and Harry's close but effective escapes that stemmed from Harry's luck and perserverance, as well as his faithful friends' talents and loyalty.  Yet, in the end, it really was Harry against Voldermort.  Harry's goodness shines through in his actions, particularly with the noblest of sacrifices.  I have read the book twice, and plan to read the books 1 -7 to savor the entire story.  A must read for everyone.  BUT, first read the first 6 books of the series or you'll miss out!
