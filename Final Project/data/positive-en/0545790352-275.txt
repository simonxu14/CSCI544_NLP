As a long time fan of Harry Potter, I was thrilled to see the series finally being produced as a colorful illustrated version.  My kids are on the younger end of the elementary school, and while they can enjoy chapter books devoid of pictures, having illustrations included are a big plus, and it helps them understand a little more of what's going on/what certain characters and scenes could look like.  The story is included in its entirety, and the illustrations are absolutely gorgeous.  This is definitely a great book to include on the bookshelf of any Harry Potter fan.
