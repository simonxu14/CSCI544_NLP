LOVE J.K. Rowling and all the Harry Potter books. I was so excited to see this version come out and I really love it. The artwork is great and I think it will help to inspire a whole new generation of Potterheads! Look forward to the eventual release of all 7 books so I can enjoy re-reading each story and one day share them with my kids.
