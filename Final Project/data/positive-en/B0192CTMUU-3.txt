As an adult who grew up on JRR Tolkein and other Sci-Fi and fantasy greats, I am thrilled that the Harry Potter series has become so popular. My 11 year son waits just as eagerly for the next release as I do, and even though the books have gotten amazingly lengthy, we both rip through them as quickly as we can.<br />When Goblet of Fire came out, he read through the entire book in 2 days, handed it over to me, and I stayed up until 5am so I could finish it as well. Since then we have lent it out to numerous friends and relatives who were equally in love with it.<br />It has all the classic elements - good against evil, bullies, unfair situations, misunderstandings, the magic that can help you win even when all seems lost. If nothing else, it is encouraging millions of youngsters to read in an age that tv and computers are replacing books. I applaud J.K. Rowling and wish her all the success in the world.
