Spoiler Free: My feelings on The Hallows are some what inexpressible, other then to say, I was completely floored, Rowling opened the flood gates on her talent and let it pure out. In an interview with The Today Show JKR. said that she was determined to write the best book possible. I think that she succeeded by a landslide. In all the months of waiting and wading through all my personal speculation, I couldn't have imagined a better ending. Even had the series gone on for another seven books.<br /><br />So.. Do I Think book 7 holds the answers to all the burning questions we've been asking? in the main yes, in as far as they were relevant to the plot, and to Rowling's overall vision. Did 7 fulfill everything I expected? Not everything no, there were somthings left out that JK. said would be included. but to be fair a lot was probably lost or changed during the editing process, I'm curious about certain things of course, but given the finshed product, I can't complain. It is I think my favorite of the series, followed by POA. and GOF. Jo really gave us and Harry her whole heart in this one. The result is not only one of the bust series closers I've ever read, but bar non one of the best books period.<br /><br />Saying goodbye to Harry was very difficult to say the least, I read extra slow jut to hold on a little longer, I even got the Deluxe Edition in part because of the expanded page count cotaining full page chapter illustrations, which in a  small way extended the experience, and made the book into somthing of a keepsake.<br /><br />Like many millions of potter fans, I will miss the nail biting wait, wild speculation, and finally the ultimate satisfaction of holding that next novel in my hands. And I sort of pity the coming generations of Potter Fans that they won't really get to feel what it was like.<br /><br />My Potter sits proudly with my Tolkein, Dickens, Austen, and Bronte just waiting to be reread, and I will, so really it's not goodbye but rather hello again and again.
