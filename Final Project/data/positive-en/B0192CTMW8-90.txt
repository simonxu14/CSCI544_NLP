I actually read the Harry Potter Series to see what they left out of the movies. If you have seen the movies but haven't read the books, I highly recommend reading them. Geared toward a young audience the books can get a bit tedious, but the overall story is well thought out and the main characters are very multi-dimensional.<br />This particular book was purchased on Amazon and arrived on time and in great condition. I would buy from this retailer again.
