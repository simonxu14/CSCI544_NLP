She has the responsibility to write blockbuster sequels to books that broke all previous records. Not only does she carry the weight of not wanting to disappoint fans around the globe, Bloomsbury and Scolastic have tied their financial futures to her continued success.<br />The Order of the Pheonix is worth the wait.  Rowling's style is as good as ever; the flow is even, the action is compelling, and the surprises are unexpected.
