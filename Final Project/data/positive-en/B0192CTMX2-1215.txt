I'm replacing all my old HP audio cassette books with the CD version.  I have no intention of paying full price, especially the later audio books, so when I saw this on sale from a third party, I snagged it.  I love the story line and Jim Dale is the BEST.  All I need is #6 and I've got the whole thing.<br /><br />This really helps pass the time while commuting to work every day.
