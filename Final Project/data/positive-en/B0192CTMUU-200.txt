If you are a Harry Potter fan this book definately does not disappoint- if you can bring yourself to look past the dust jacket.  Of all four of the  books thus far, this is not only the best and thickest, it is also THE MOST  HIDEOUS LOOKING!  For a book that took so long to write and one that is  grossing so much  money, the publisher should SERIOUSLY taking another look  at  the art that is provided to sell this book.  They say you should never  judge a book by it's cover and it DEFINATELY holds true in this instance.  The story is well told and more in depth than any of the three previous  books.  As most readers know, each book has Harry growing a year older and  moving through another year at Hogwarts.  With the increase in age comes  darker themes in the story.  An excellent and very quick read even at 700+  pages!  I give this my highest recommendation, just discard the dust jacket  or leave it on the shelf!
