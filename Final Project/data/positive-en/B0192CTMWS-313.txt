It's amazing to see so many, presumably adult, reviewers complaining about Harry's behavior in this book.  Adults whining about teenage angst is not very convincing.  It seems like these people have never outgrown their own teenage angst.  If someone can't understand why Harry might be a little cranky while reading this incredibly well written story, he or she must be lacking in both imagination and emotional depth.<br />I wish that the reviews for the audio book were seperated from those for the hardcover book.  Jim Dale's performance is remarkable.  It brings the story to life in a way that even the most vivid imagination couldn't.  His rendition of Dolores Umbridge is particularly effective.  Just reading the book can give you an idea just how creepy this character is, but hearing her brought to life by Mr. Dale in this audio book will make your skin crawl.  He is just as effective in bringing the other characters in the book to life.  His performance clearly demonstrates just how brilliant a stroryteller that Ms. Rowling is.<br />The book is outstanding.  The audio book is truly amazing!
