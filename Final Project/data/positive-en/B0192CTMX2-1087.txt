Knowing the series would have to end, I always wondered if J.K. Rowling would go for a shock ending or just sweetly wrap up the story with all the bad guys dead and everyone else living happily ever after.<br /><br />Instead she showed the loss and heartache that such a victory would entail, the cost to families and friends, and how even the bad guys can survive and go on with their lives.<br /><br />Well done and farewell to a great series. I hope to see newer and equally fine books from this most favorite of my authors.
