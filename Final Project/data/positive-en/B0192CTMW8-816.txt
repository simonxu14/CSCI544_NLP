Harry Potter's first summer back with his wicked relatives and the stinking fatso of Durlsey is much WORSE than ever before. In fact, the poor boy was made a PRISONER in his very own room on his twelfth birthday!<br />Fortunately, his best friend, Ron Weasley helps Harry make a daring  escape in the very dead of night and thus he gets to live with Ron's wizard  family! There is one problem, however. Dobby, the slave elf has suddenly  appeared to stop Harry from going off to the Hogwarts boarding school, but  our clever young heroes somehow makes it - only to GET IN MORE TROUBLE THAN  EVER BEFORE! And the dark castle corridors are far more dangerous than ever  before, especially with a very narcissistic new teacher, a celebrity  stalker, and...something DEADLY on Harry Potter's very tail. What's  more...many victims - even a ghost included, are getting frozen right on  their very spots! But the answer itself lies somewhere in the very latrine  where a young girl mysteriously died fifty years ago as well as an ancient  diary that suddenly turns up there. So Harry Potter must find it quickly  before some evil Heir of Slytherin finally turns up TO TAKE OVER THE WHOLE  HOGWARTS SCHOOL!<br />Cleverly crafted, well-paced, and marvelously timed! In  fact, there's even a few times when I thought J.K. Rowling was slipping a  bit when suddenly, she leaps up TO GIVE ME THE BIG SLIP! Whew...I'm now  getting JEALOUS of her rich imagination and her truly IMMENSE writing  talents that WILL snare even the most disgruntled fantasy fans NO MATTER  HOW OLD HE OR SHE IS! Oh, just wait until you get to the part where Ron  Weasley THROWS UP great barrels of slimy garden slugs!
