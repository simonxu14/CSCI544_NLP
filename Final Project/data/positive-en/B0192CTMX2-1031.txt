As promised, this new outing to Harry Potter's wizard-Britain is darker than the previous books in this series.  Harry is having to deal with grief and loss and guilt, far more than he ever has before.<br />Quite a few new characters are introduced, and we say goodbye to a very much-liked-in-the-fandom character.  Some of the new people are likable (including a very original girl from Ravenclaw House) but the most prominent new character has a personality like Nurse Ratched in _One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest._<br />A worthy return to the Wizard World, overall.
