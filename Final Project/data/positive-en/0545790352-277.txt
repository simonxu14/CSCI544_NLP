I am one of the biggest Harry Potter fans out there, so any time something new from this world appears, I have to have it.  I was so excited to hear that an illustrated version was being released and now that it's finally in my hands, it does not disappoint!  It's beautiful!  The illustrations are gorgeous and add an entirely new dimension and delight when reading the story.  This is the perfect addition to any HP collection out there and a truly great gift for all Potterheads.  I really hope they continue to illustrate the rest of the series.
