This book is fantastic for any Harry Potter fan - I can imagine myself reading this book aloud to future children, and have already stopped to enjoy the illustrations several times. The book is well sized for the illustrations and is printed beautifully. I can't wait for the rest of the books to come out with illustrations - we collect various editions and printings of the Harry Potter books and can't wait to have the full set.
