The Harry Potter series is a charming collection of novels and Chamber of Secrets is no exception.  Chamber is a novel with appeal to all ages, much outside the 9-12 market in the book description.  For young adults, Chamber will be a challenging and exciting read (and reread).  For adults, Chamber is fun.  It'll take you back to your youth.  One thing I find striking about J.K. Rowling is her extraordinary knack of being able to capture the essence of young adulthood.  Harry, for all his wizardness, is special and unique in the way all 12 year olds are.  His friends are great and his adventures are entertaining.  A fun read all around.
