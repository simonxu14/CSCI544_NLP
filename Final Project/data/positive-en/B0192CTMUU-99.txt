Five Stars is not enough...<br />The eloquent and gracious tale of young Master Potter's education (as a wizard and as a person) continues in this LARGE reader of further adventures at HogWartz!<br />If you are new to Ms. Rowling's tales, back out to the search screen and get yourself a copy of the first volume [try to locate the UK release if possible but forget locating a copy at a re-sale shop] and try this seminal coming of age work in a slightly "lighter" variety.<br />If you couldn't wait [but have waited for some reason] then Your Time Is Now... order immediately and get ready to have to avoid any unsympathetic associates as you are swept away yet again by Harry, Ron, Albus, Hermoine, Hedwig, Hargid, Snape, He Who Must Not Be Named, Peeves and all the rest during the continuing advenures of our boy Harry....
