Unless you have lived under a rock for the past five years, you know who Harry Potter is.  You know that he is a young wizard who attends a magic school called Hogwarts.  You also know that Harry wears black horned rimmed glasses and has a lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead.  In the five years since it was published, the book has become a phenomenon as wide spread as Star Wars or Star Trek.  But with any series that is popular, there is a chance that the book is mediocre and is popular due to a huge advertising campaign.  However, after having read it, I have concluded that the series is popular for one very good reason: it is good.<br />Harry Potter is able to live the dreams of people everywhere.  He is able to escape the dullness and the pain of the real world and journey to a world where witches, wizards, dragons, and magic exist.  Who hasn't wished that he or she could use magic or fly?  Reading about magic and dragons causes the reader to have a sense of wonder that never disappears throughout the book.<br />The characters are good as well.  Harry is a believeable character, as are his friends Ron and Hermonie.  They are likeable people and you actually root for them.  The descriptions of magic are good as well and never lose the sense of wonder.<br />All in all, this is a very good book and I definitely recommend you read it.
