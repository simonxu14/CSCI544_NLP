My son's teacher was reading this series to him.  He loved these books, so, we bought the set for him.  Well, once my husband and I started reading, we could not stop!  These books are excellent for people of all  ages!  The spectacular fantasy storyline combined with the many realities  that we face growing up, is so appealing!  We can relate to Harry's  problems of growing up, yet, we can fantasize about having special powers  and a magical destiny!  I can't wait until the next books are out, and  neither can my son!  I haven't read such fun and exciting books in ages!
