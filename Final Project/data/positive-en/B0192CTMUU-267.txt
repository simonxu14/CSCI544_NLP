Harry Potter is back and is more interesting than ever.  The older he gets, the less I feel guilty about reading a &quot;children's&quot; book.  My favorite character by far is &quot;Mad-Eye&quot; Moody.  What an amazing  addition to the cast of characters.  There is love, danger, action,  everything a muggle could want in a book.  The much publicized death is  upsetting, but it goes with the flow of the story.  I was pleased with the  length of the book because I didn't read it all in one night.  It meant two  night of reveling in Harry Potter's adventures.
