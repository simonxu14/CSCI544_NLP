Loved it for the seventh time! As always a joy to read and impressive to move through plots, counter plots and characterization.  I recommend this for all youngsters aged 8 - 80 .This book is worth all five stars and probably more...can't wait to read the next installment coming July 31st. Not to mention the new film this December. The adventure continues!
