(This is a spoiler-free review.) Rowling's done it again--another standout book in the Harry Potter series. The fifth book--The Order of the Phoenix--lives up to the reputation of its predecessors and then some. In by far the darkest of the five tales, Harry faces more than just his nemesis Voldemort. Harry must face his own inner demons while coping with some more typically teenage issues.<br />To be honest, I thought Harry a bit too angry for parts of the book--I kept wanting him to snap out of it and think more rationally. But when I think back to when I was fifteen--I don't know how much more logical my own thought would have been. So in that sense, Rowling does capture the turmoil of the teenage years brilliantly. I did enjoy Neville having a larger role in this book--I hope we continue to see more of him. I was a bit confused by the Luna character--not quite sure what we're meant to make of her. The villainous Dolores Umbridge (I do love Rowling's play-on-words) is wonderful and Snape continues to the be the most fantastic character you love to hate. Of course there is the one character who dies...very sad, I will miss that character greatly. The club set up by Harry and pals is really quite good and Draco Malfoy's continued annoying presence is always good for a laugh.  It was indeed great to see the staff all pulling together to support one another and Hogwarts when it was truly needed. And needless to say--Dumbledore is amazing!<br />I read the book through in less than two days (and enjoyed every page, it was just so good!)--and now of course I am sorry I did so, seeing as it is over!  Perhaps I will just have to go back and re-read them all...hurry up with the next book!
