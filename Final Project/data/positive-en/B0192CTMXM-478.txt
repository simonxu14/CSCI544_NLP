Just finished 're-reading the third of the seven books. I think this is the second best book of the series, book 7 being the best. It is a nice change of pace from the constant threat of Voldermort in the first two books while still tying back to this main theme. I had to laugh when I got to the part about Harry and the accident with his aunt. Also, the Knight bus was a brilliant addition to the magical world of Harry Potter.
