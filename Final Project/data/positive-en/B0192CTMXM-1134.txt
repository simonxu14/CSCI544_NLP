Kudos to J.K. Rowling for a fascinating look at Harry's coming-of-age.  I didn't expect such a fantastic and realistic look at teen angst - Harry's growing up!  The wide-eyed innocence is gone and Harry looks at his future in sober judgement while learning what his priorities are, dealing with the past and preparing for his future.  The plot is intricate and revealing, and leaves me praying that it won't be three more years until we have book 6!
