I mean, after all, what's not to love!  I usually shy away from reading "what everyone's reading", but am I glad I made an exception to pick up the first HP book--and have not stoped reading and rereading them yet!  Well written for adults and older shildren alike (I fight with my 11 and 13 year olds for reading rights) its great reading, period!
