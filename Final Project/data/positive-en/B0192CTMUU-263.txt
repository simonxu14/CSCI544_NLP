This book does not diappoint.  Like the others in the series it is a roller coaster ride with a thrilling climax and many plot twists and turns.  I would caution those with younger kids (my Harry fan is 8) that there are  some dark and disturbing images in this one.  Muggles being tormented for  sport and the callous murder of a character are not for the very young.  I  read Harry aloud to my son and I would advise other parents who do the same  to read a chapter or so ahead in case they need to soften the imagery or at  least not read the scariest chapters right before bed!
