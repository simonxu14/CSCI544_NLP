My 4.5 year old son became obsessed with Pokemon so naturally I had to buy him a book with every Pokemon in it.<br />The book lists the Pokemon alphabetically - gives some basic stats like the type and features and then gives a cute little bio about the pokemon.  My son has already memorized many Pokemon and is teaching himself to read by trying to sound out the names of Pokemon he doesn't know<br /><br />Only downside: he uses the book so much that some pages are already falling out - so the spine glue is not perfect
