In reviewing the cassette edition earlier, I neglected to mention the incredible performance of Mr. Dale - which is what prompted me to review the edition in the first place!<br />While encouraging kids to read is, of  course, hugely important, the performance by Mr. Dale is so entertaining  that it warrants purchasing BOTH the book and the cassette editions for  your children. The many characters are easily identifiable with Mr. Dale's  wide range of British/Scottish accents, and they are brought to life by his  treatment. As well, Americans will appreciate hearing the proper  pronounciation of &quot;Her-MY-oh-nee&quot; (not &quot;Hermy-WON&quot;) and  other British names. I'm very impressed with the quality of the performance  and am anxious to purchase other cassette editions of the series.
