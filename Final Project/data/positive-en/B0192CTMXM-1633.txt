I'm one of those people who has been with Harry from the beginning.  I started reading the books when I had just turned 12 and now at 20 I'm sad to see the series come to an end but so pleased with how it all turned out.  When I had just finished the 7th book my mom knowing how much I had anticipated the final resolution asked how it was, to which I replied, "perfect, just simply perfect".  It was everything I had hoped it would be.  J.K. Rowling you are amazing, thank you so much.
