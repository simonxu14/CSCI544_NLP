I'd say the writing style is adequate without being impressive, but then these are children's books.  But the creativity of the whole Harry Potter series is astounding.  J. K. Rowling created a whole world with distinct personalities, magic spells, mythical creatures, and ongoing adventures that totally rocked my world.  I had always maintained that I wasn't fond of fantasy fiction, yet liked fairy tales, and that's still pretty much true.  These  books are more reminiscent of fairy tales, the deep dark ones typical of central Europe.<br /><br />This volume is my favorite of the series for several reasons.  The youth of the protogonists, Harry's excitement on discovering this other world, perhaps the milder nature of the threat to this world.  But that didn't stop me from devouring the others.  I downloaded all the books to my Kindle, and by the fifth book I was so addicted, that no other book seemed remotely as satisfying.  I subsequently scoured the internet for some hope that Rowling would go on to write about the same characters and their adult lives and adventures.  Please, J. K. Rowling, pretty please.
