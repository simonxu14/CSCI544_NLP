I just received my copy in the mail and I couldn't be more pleased! There are BEAUTIFUL illustrations on nearly every page. It's quite a bit bigger than the original book, but it makes for the perfect size for story time with young ones (or just by yourself). It's a pretty good deal on amazon as well because the inside jacket says that it usually retails for $39.99. I would HIGHLY recommend this book to everyone interested in Harry Potter- whether they are long-time fans or muggles just starting out with the series.
