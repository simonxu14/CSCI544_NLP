With each new book, I keep thinking to myself &quot;it just can't get any better&quot;, and they do!  They become more engrossing and mesmerising and you keep wanting to know more and more about Harry Potter and his gang of  friends.<br />I believe the true strength of this series is in how well JK  Rowling is aging her characters.  We started seeing them at age 11 and now  they are age 14 and with each book you feel that they are another year  older and you can see their newfound maturaty and insecurities coming out  of them and it is just masterful.  So often in series what gets dull is  that the main character NEVER changes, but here, you are watching Harry  grow up and you truly feel like you are right there with him.<br />The other  strength of these books is that they aren't made up of cookie cutter plots,  each time you think you know who the bad guy is and how Harry and his  friends will face the dangers and you end up shocked at how wrong you were  about everything.<br />After I closed the back cover, I couldn't help but  thinking &quot;what a shame it is that there will be only 3 more books in  this series&quot;, JK Rowling has once again cast her spell over me and you  can bet that when book 5 gets released, FedEx will once again be making  that special delivery to my doorstep the day of the release.<br />If you  haven't already started with these books, regardless of who you are, you  will love them.  This book is loved by all, young and old, because the  messages that come through them are ageless.  Buy them all and cherish this  treasure.  If you haven't read this one, buy it, I promise you'll only be  left wanting for more.<br />Thank you JK Rowling for giving the world this  gift.
