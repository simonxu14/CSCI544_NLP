Has anyone noticed that those who review this book at three stars or less and REALLY MEAN IT cannot spell, or put a sentence together?<br />To those who think the characters are too simple, I'd just point out that one man's  piece of cardboard is another man's archetype. And I can't see how you can  argue that Snape, in particular, is all good or all bad.<br />To those who  think it's no good because it &quot;isn't any better than&quot; C.S. Lewis,  Madeleine L'Engle, Edward Eager, Lewis Carroll, Norton Juster, Roald Dahl,  or whomever--this is a little strange. If it's only &quot;as good as&quot;  the work of these other writers, that means it's EXCELLENT. And a lot of  the kids who are caught up in the Harry Potter phenomenon are bound to  discover these other writers' books. (This is a good thing.)<br />To those who  feel that Slytherin is an evil house, I really think you're making an  unwarranted inference. Harry didn't want to go into Slytherin because he'd  heard too many dark wizards came out of it, but he is sensitive to this  because of his parents' deaths. So far we've had 3-4 unsympathetic  Slytherin characters, out of the 200 or so in that house. I'd be willing to  bet that Rowling will eventually give us a sympathetic Slytherin  character!<br />And to those who are afraid of its &quot;un-Christian&quot;  overtones: I think rather than keep this book from your kids you'd do  better to teach them the difference between fantasy and reality.
