I was so excited to see this, as I'd been waiting impatiently for my four-year-old to gain enough patience to sit through a book as long as Sorcerer's Stone with no pictures. This is the perfect way to introduce him to the world of Harry Potter! We're about a third of the way through and he loves it, and the pictures are definitely part of what keeps his interest. When a new character is introduced he wants to find their picture, and when we come to a big scene like the two-page spread of the Hogwarts Express scene shown on the cover, he loves to look at it and identify everything he recognizes. Some pictures are nothing like my mental image, some are better than the movies - but all of them are a detailed and beautiful interpretation of the text.<br /><br />No, there aren't pictures on every page - but if you've felt how heavy this book is already, you must realize that adding even more pictures would make it unwieldy. I know they're going to release one more illustrated edition, but I can't imagine they'll keep it up through the longer books. Hopefully my son will be old enough to sit through without the pictures by then!
