I have to take away at least one star for Jim Dale's reading of this story.  His inflections were strange and poorly timed.  On more than one occasion there was a passage that he read flat or pensive that ended in &quot;she exclaimed&quot;!  Oh well, as long as you can make the mental  adjustments for how the text OUGHT to read, you'll do fine.  I spend 2-3  hours in my car daily, so this was a great way to be a part of the Potter  craze.
