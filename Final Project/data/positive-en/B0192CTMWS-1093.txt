As Harry and friends go on a search for the Horcruxes, they are introduced to something they would never have believed, had Harry's Invisibility Cloak not been there. The new something, or shall I say these, are the Deathly Hallows. Harry suddenly becomes obsessed with them and becoming the Master of Death. All the while, Voldemort is slowly becoming stronger and the angst is greater than ever before. One of her best in the series, I'd say (or would my daughter...) Great, in general! Buy it!
