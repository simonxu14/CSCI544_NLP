I bought several books for an orphanage in Ethiopia - the kids speak 3 languages, including English and are ravenous readers.  They loved this book and all the others I sent!  I sent mostly books about science and inventors, but this was one I thought could spark imagination - apparently they LOVED it!  Go JK!
