Overall:<br />--------<br />4 stars - A fairly satisfying ending to the Dark Lord / Harry Potter saga -- the ending is a bit weak, slightly cliched and a lot of dead cool characters.<br />Harry controls the final confrontation with the Dark Lord yet gives the Dark Lord a way out (why?).  The Dark Lord's insanity combined with meglomania is his downfall not Harry Potter.  It is a cheapening of what one expected from Harry Potter.<br /><br />The search for the Horcruxes is only really possible due to Hermiene's knowledge of magic and magical skills.  Harry does show much character and pushes for understanding the Deathly Hallows but really it is more a plot device than anything else.  The Dark Lord is blinded by power (searching for the Elder Wand) when he should be finishing off the opposition with the ruthlessness of hardened, paranoid war lord.<br /><br />The great losses by the forces of good seem to be trivialized by the epilogue.  I was looking for some type of memorial / recognition of the sacrifices made.  The life as usual with the references of respect by naming of the various children is touching but not enough.<br /><br />Characters:<br />-----------<br />The deaths of main characters "off-screen" is disappointing and cheapens their loss.  Frankly, I cared much more about the characters that died off-screen than the potential loss of Harry's life.  It is strange to think the side-characters were more important; I guess the sacrafice they were willing to make for a friend and the side of good is more compelling than Harry's battle with the Dark Lord.<br /><br />The assault on Hogswort showed a tremendous amount of the internal qualities of the side characters than Harry.  Harry raised the you can not do this as I will not have your death on my conscious non-sense again.  Harry is clearly missing the point of friendship, trust, sacrafice and need to fight evil/darkness at all costs.  Why does Ron and Hermiene have to be Harry's conscience all the time?  The characters understand the risk but they also understand what is at stake -- please give them some credit!<br /><br />Mrs. Weasley: She rocks!  It was great to see her step up as it is hinted that she is a formittable witch in the other books.<br /><br />Snape: He is one of the best characters in a very long time for me.  He is very complex and well developed.  I did not like how it was all tied back to silent love of a character that is barely developed.  If you are going to tied up so much of your life for a lost love, the lost love should be developed in more detail.<br /><br />Harry: The sudden rash of logistical ability to get the horcruxes is out of character for him.  The sudden wisdom to appreciate what Dumbledore had setup is out of character and seems forced just to get the story to a conclusion.  It is good that he finally accepts people for being able to think and work as a team (not guided by him).<br /><br />The selflessness of Harry that the ability to turn down the Deathly Hallows is not done well as it conflicts with his selfness internal discussions.  I appreciate that Harry is supposed to be the bright shining light of all that is good but the suddenness of being selfless does not quite work for me; it needed more development as I have found Harry to be very selfish in a lot of ways through out the series.<br /><br />Ginny: She is a good character that deserves more development.<br /><br />Dobbie: A good tie in here and lead up to the final battle.  A way to turn an annoying character from early on into a real character.<br /><br />Plot:<br />-----<br />The plot is pretty straight forward as it needs to resolve the Dark Lord vs. Harry situation...does the evil triumuph over good.  The race between the Dark Lord and Harry's small group is reasonably well done.  However, the Dark Lord would have realized the problem with the Elder Wand before the final showdown.<br /><br />The Deathly Hallows is an interesting plot device but should have been mentioned in the prior books.  It seems like it was added as a way to wrap up the series while the rest of the books show a clear well-developed back story.  Note: this is a minor point given the level of complex back story JKR has developed for the other books.<br /><br />Action:<br />-------<br />The final assault is well done with good pacing.  The "good" guys should really have been wiping out attackers more effectively as they would fight together better than typical one-on-one tactics of the Death Eaters...the concept of surpressing fire, area of effect spells and defensive casting would really have helped the good guys.  Also, it is a war and killing the attackers is ok...war is hell!<br /><br />Prose:<br />------<br />The prose is on par with the other stories.<br /><br />Summary:<br />--------<br />Overall: 4 stars<br />Characters: 3 to 3.5 stars<br />Plot: 3 stars<br />Action: 4 to 4.5 stars -- the assault is well done<br />Prose: 3 stars
