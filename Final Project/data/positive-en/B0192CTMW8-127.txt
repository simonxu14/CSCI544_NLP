On the level of introducing a child to the joys of reading a long novel, this book has succeeded far and beyond my expectations. Ever since I began reading Harry Potter to my six-year old daughter, it has been the main attraction of the day or evening. In addition to the suspense, adventure, fantasy, and mystery that come with a Harry Potter story, the author does a good job in walking a fine line between writing about a magical world in which anything is possible (e.g. preserving a copy of one's self in a magical diary), to addressing that part of life which is governed by laws and rules (e.g. underage wizards cannot practice magic in front of muggles, but how the Ministry of Magic knows when this happens is never explained).<br />For us the excitement of reading Harry Potter is certainly real and magical; and I hope my daughter's enthusiasm carries over when reading other books that are more concerned with the rules and laws governing the lives and relationships of muggles.
