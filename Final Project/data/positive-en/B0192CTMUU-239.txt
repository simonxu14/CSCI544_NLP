I cannot state in this space what hasn't already been said about the absolute brilliance and genre of J.K. Rowlings novel/novels. I'm completely sure, without a doubt, that 100 years from now, these books will find their home on an old, carved mahogany bookshelf next to the likes of A.A.Milne, Beatrix Potter, Frank Baum, Grimm Brothers, Mark Twain, Edgar Allen Poe, the Bronte Sisters, Madeleine L'Engle, John Steinbeck, H.G. Wells, George Orwell, Shakespeare (quite possibly!)etc...As readers we are truly lucky to have been a part of this literary whirlwind and excitement and will remember well, for generations to come, these masterpieces we lovingly call &quot;The Harry Potter Books&quot;.
