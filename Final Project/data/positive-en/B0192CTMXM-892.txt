And it's not an easy road for him even without being the most famous wizard in the world.<br /><br />I love the way J.K. Rowling writes about Harry as a teenager. One moment he's happy, the next, angry and sulky. In this book his attempts to date are clumsy, just like in real life.<br /><br />This book is a great mixture of comedy and drama and has one of the best climaxes ever, which is even better than the scene in book 3.<br /><br />Having read it for the 3rd or 4th time, I see that it is brilliant. I caught all sorts of nuances I didn't catch the first time I devoured it whole.<br /><br />It also has the worse villian. Even more horrible than He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named.<br /><br />So read it for the comical moments, the intense moments and that theme of friendship and sacrifice that makes the Harry Potter series so special.
