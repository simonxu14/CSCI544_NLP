Book 2 is really a replay of book 1 and works to reinforce the basic structure of the series.  The plot, including the finale, is actually better designed than in book 1, but there isn't as much emotion behind it.  The fact that Harry is a wizard isn't new anymore.  We spend the book getting used to life inside Hogwarts alongside Harry.  It is a fun journey, but not quite as exciting as the initial discovery.
