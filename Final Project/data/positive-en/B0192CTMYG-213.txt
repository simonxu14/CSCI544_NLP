If you have even thought about getting this book.....you should!!! You'll only have to decide hard or soft-cover.<br />For anyone who likes or is interested in even the slightest bit of supernatural fiction, YOU WILL LOVE THIS BOOK. The author is brilliantly creative and the story-line is just perfect.<br />I could hardly keep my hands off this book; I read this in two sittings which probably would have been just one if I haden't started late the first night.
