I promised myself that I would go back and review my purchases on Amazon, so here I am having found my first ever order. I remember waiting for my Amazon delivery the day this book was released... I hugged the delivery man when he arrived at our door. Thank you to Amazon for bringing happiness to so many young Harry Potter fans, myself included, as we anxiously waited for the newest and final installment. This is my favorite book of all time. It ties together Harry, Ron, and Hermione's story (the story belongs to all of them, not just to Harry) in such a beautiful, holistic way. I highly recommend this and all Harry Potter books to any reader, young or old.
