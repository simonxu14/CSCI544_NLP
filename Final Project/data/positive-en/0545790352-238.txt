Outstanding Book - Fantastic pictures...there is a SERIOUS attention to detail by Jim Kay, and the fact that JK Rowling herself strongly endorsed this illustrated book insures that this is a collector's item which should be passed down for generations to come. There are some absolutely GREAT reviews of this book on Amazon and I can't recommend to read them enough! The one thing that I would like to point out is the response from my five - 5 - year old daughter. Initially, I was reading to her the actual text hardback book: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and she wanted me to stop reading it in the first few days...for her it was a bit scary and &#34;dark&#34; so she wasn't really thrilled with it. Now that I have this illustrated version I am able to read the EXACT SAME TEXT, but the pictures obviously help her &#34;soften&#34; the storyline. I've already purchased another for her as a keepsake for years to come, inclusive of her ability to read this for years to come, including, maybe her family (but I digress too far into the future.)  Bottom Line...Don't Hesitate - BUY THIS BOOK!!!
