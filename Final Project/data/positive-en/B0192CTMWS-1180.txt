J.K. Rowling has done it again, and the Harry Potter series has evolved brilliantly.  Anyone who has raised a teenager will recognize the moodiness Harry displays throughout.  He is growing up, and finding that it is not so easy.  The book may have started a bit slow, but it picked up steam nicely and answered many questions.  I look forward to the next book and hope to learn more about Harry's parents.
