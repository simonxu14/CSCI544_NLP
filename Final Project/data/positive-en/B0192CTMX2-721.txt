Thanks to having had children of a perfect age when the first Harry Potter was published, I've been a Harry Potter fan since most people never heard of Harry Potter.<br /><br />The 7th and final book in this series was every bit as enthralling as the previous ones, and, as a writer and poet myself, I cannot get over my amazement at the imaginative achievement demonstrated in these books.<br /><br />After reading to page 544 in 10 hours Saturday, I completed the book yesterday evening, and have spent an equal number of hours between readings and since remembering the vast number of characters, developments, personal relationships, magical surprises and well-turned phrases packed into these books.<br /><br />Entirely apart from the delight the books have given to me, and our entire family, I've also found them an encouraging analogy for our troubled times. It is possible to triumph over adversity and evil. And at this particular moment, I can only hope that truth and reality, will for once, mirror art.<br /><br />Yes, art. It's a brilliant series, and it's given some brilliance and immeasurable enjoyment to me in all 10 years since the Potter adventures began.
