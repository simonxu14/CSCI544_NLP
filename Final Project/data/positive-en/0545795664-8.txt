This book is great.  It's got so much info on all these different Pok&eacute;mon. It lets you know which Pok&eacute;mon evolves into which, and has separate entries for the evolved and unevolved forms.  It has phonetic pronunciation guides for all Pok&eacute;mon, it tells you their type, (normal, water, fire, flying, etc.) their height and their weight, and lists their possible moves.  It even tells you what region each Pok&eacute;mon comes from.  The info is well laid out and easy to find, with the Pok&eacute;mon in alphabetical order by name.  My son loves it, and he'll get it out to use as a manual when we're pretending to be Pok&eacute;mon trainers.<br /><br />It contains all the Pok&eacute;mon we've heard of, and many that we haven't heard of.
