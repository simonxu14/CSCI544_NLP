After reading the first book in this series in October 1998, I have been obsessed with Rowling's accounts of Harry Potter and his experiences at Hogwarts, a school for wizards and witches. Each book in the series  develops the characters more fully, and the plots increase in complexity.  The fourth book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, achieves more complex  characterizations of Harry, Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Draco  Malfoy, and, of course, He Who Must Not Be Named.  The tone darkens  somewhat, and the evil ones begin to threaten more forcefully.  As did  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, this novel contains several  sinister adults.  These evil ones continue to present Harry with  increasingly complicated tasks and challenges.  A sense of mystery pervades  the book. Can Harry continue to prevail over Voldemort?  Why does he have  to spend every summer with the Dursleys?  What does Dumbledore see as good  in Snape and Hagrid?  Will Harry develop romantic interests in young  witches at Hogwarts?  Just as Rowling had promised,  these issues are  addressed in this book, and many important questions are answered.  This  terrific author  spins this fourth tale skillfully, including the  delightful details that are characteristic of her wonderful style in the  first three novels.  Without a doubt, this book will please readers of  all ages.  The elements of a fantastic tale reside within the 734 pages of  this novel, and no reader will be disappointed in what Rowling  has crafted  in this book.  Now, how long must we wait for Harry Potter V?
