"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," the final book in the wonderful series by J.K. Rowling is not for the faint of heart.  In fact, it's like none of the other Potter books at all.  Harry has grown up.  There is very little humor, plenty of terror and action, and many, many heartwrenching moments involving the loss of beloved characters, some unexpectedly.  The primary point of this book is for Harry, Ron and Hermione to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes mentioned in earlier books.  This in turn, will hopefully result in the defeat of Voldemort.  Naturally they run into multiple problems that impede their quest.  Can Harry defeat the Dark Lord?  Who will survive in the end?  To find out, you must read "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows."<br /><br />As stated before, this book is both action-packed and terrifying at times.  Younger readers may find it hard to understand or accept the deaths of key characters.  I can honestly say that the death of one particular character hit me very hard.  It almost brought me to tears, and I haven't read a book that has been able to do that to me in a long time.  There is a sinister air about the entire book until the final chapter, where everything, like it or not, is resolved.<br /><br />I don't want to give anything away, so I'll keep this review short.  Just know that Rowling neatly resolves all of the loose ends of the other books and revisits a few (now) obvious hints from earlier books.  I think that the ending isn't so much a shock as it is bittersweet goodbye to a wonderful series of tales.  Highly recommended.
