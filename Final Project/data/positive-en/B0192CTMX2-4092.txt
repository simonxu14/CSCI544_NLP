so many pages we've traveled this journey.  what this few more.<br />It's quite alot.  It's a powerful journey.<br />I won't lie to you, there are a few pacing issues.  There are a few times where it speeds up only to suddenly stop.  But you do have this feeling like there there is a constant threat available, something missing from book six.<br />I really don't need to be reviewing this,  if you've read book six you know you want to read this one.  ya'll are probaly reading this expecting to hear if it's any good, if your a fan yes.  nif your not, why are you reading this review?
