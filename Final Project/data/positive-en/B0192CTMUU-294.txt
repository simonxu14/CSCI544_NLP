The fourth book, Goblet of Fire, although over 700 pages, reads easily and keeps the Harry Potter series alive.  The beginning of the book is a bit slow, but, as with the others, you don't want the story to end!  Harry,  Ron, Hermonione are older and are now teens.  They are like family after  reading books I, II, and III.  These are characters you care about and want  to know more about.  I can't wait for Book V!  Write fast Ms. Rowling.
