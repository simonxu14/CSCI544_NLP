I was pleased with this book.  There are some wonderful twists.  As usual, Rowling's writing is such that it is interesting and easy to follow.  Rowling furthers the plot, while ending the book in the usual tidy fashion, leaving the reading only with the quetion of "Well, what is going to happen next?"  Even though her longest to date in the series, the book was so good it went by in just under a day.  It captivated me.  I leaves me wanting for book 6.  Obviously, it's a must have for those following the series.
