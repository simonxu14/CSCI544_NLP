Recently I purchased the audio book Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Jim Dale, who has narrated all of the audio book series of Harry Potter books delivers another fantastic performance.His has brilliantly captured and projected the persoalities of the characters with his voice. This audio book is as good as reading the novel or watching the movie.
