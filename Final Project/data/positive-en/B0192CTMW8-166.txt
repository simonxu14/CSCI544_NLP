Each time I pick up a new Harry Potter book, I am barely able to put it down.  The same rings true for almost anyone I've met that took the time to sit down and read these fine books.  There are the cynics, but they are the people that haven't read the books, or have only seen the movies. The books are 1000 times better than the movies!!!  Read the book first!  Another great thing about Harry Potter?  It gets kids reading.
