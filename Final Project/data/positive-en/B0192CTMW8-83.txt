The second Harry Potter book while scarier and not quite for my six-year-old yet, amazed me yet again with the depth of character J.K. Rowling brings to children.  I loved the novel and couldn't put it down.  The story inspires loyalty among children and teaches them never to give up  on themselves, even if they do make mistakes.
