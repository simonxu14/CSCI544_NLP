This book was definetly the best book I have ever read. The author dosn't just give a great story, but she describes the characters at such great lengths that you feel like you know them by the end. The following books are equally good, they are a must read for anyone who can understand imagination and who can suspend their disbelief. The moment you open the book, it takes you to a different world, and that's what I love about it. I can't wait until the next book comes out. Take my advice, and read this book. I would also advise buying it, because you probably will want to read it more than once!
