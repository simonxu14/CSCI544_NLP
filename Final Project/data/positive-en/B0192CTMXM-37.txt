I just finished Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheoneix just last night, and the only word I can utter at the moment is "W-O-W!"  This book is filled with so many twists and turns that I couldn't put it down.<br />I do not wish to write a spoiler-filled review, so I'll keep my comments general and spoiler-free... however, there are many published and press-covered rumors that I will touch on, without revealing anything.<br />The book starts with, quite litterally a bang.  It moves us swiftly from place to place and gives us a view of Harry's world that we've never had an opportunity to see before.  New creatures, new characters, and new villians fill the pages.  With rumors flying about a death in the book, and a confirmation from J.K., I was always worried about the slightest thing that happened to any one of the characters at any time.  However, by the end of the book, I admit that I was shocked and surprised by the death that does occur.  Filled with twists and turns I am still trying to figure everything out in my head, as I read it far to  quickly.  This weekend I'll likely be able to start again, this time devouring every word as though it is a slice of my very favorite treat!  This book is not only sure to please all readers, but it moves Harry into the coming of age in his fifteenth year of life, and leaves us all hanging on the end wondering... What's next!?!
