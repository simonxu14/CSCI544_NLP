This book is my favorite of all the series. It was such an escape from reality years ago when my mom bought it for me. Having Type 1 diabetes, I felt different, as no family member has every had it in history. It helped me not feel alone, and that something so heartbreaking makes you stronger. I realized that though I felt alone, having people accept you and love you, depletes it. JK Rowling is inspiring, and just wow. She's helped a lot of people love to read and help depressed human beings.
