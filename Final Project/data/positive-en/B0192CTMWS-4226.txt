my opinion is along the lines of the others, harry potter is an intricate story filled with love friendship honor betrayal the fight againt evil the choice we all have to make between what is right and what is easy and a wonderul world of magic muggles Hogwarts and wizards and witches jsut learned what it is to be so, i read the other books multiple times trying to figure out the mystery and had almost everything figured out before the epilogue was published this last week, even so JK managed to lead me down a path to a conclusion more than even i thought it would be and to be honest i was astounded at myself for not thinking the most obvious point of it all. in this series i laughed i bawled my eyes out i cheered and i booed, and most of all i loved all these wonderful characters, JK tied up all her plot points and hints, what a masterful story this woman had in her head!!!<br />my only disapointed point what how much information of her wonderful characters especially the weasleys with all they risked over the years for Harry and what was right.. were barely touched on when it was all done. THOSE plot points that werent tied up bothered me the most. and like all the other potter fans i am more than disheartened today that its all over.cept the movies.  i highly recommed this series to anybody not just children, but if your children do read it read it WITH them you can get jsut as much out of it as they,  please be aware that the older harry gets the scarier and more REAL the reality that is around harry gets. but its still worth every second. DUMBLEDORES ARMY!<br />ENJOY!
