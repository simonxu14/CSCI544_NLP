My book was delivered ... at 11 AM, and I didn't move off thecouch until 6.  The first 200 pages or so were a little slower moving, filled with descriptions of Quidditch action and wizardly modes of  transportation, but the pace picked after the World Cup, and the last 200  pages were absolutely riveting.  By the last page, battle lines have been  drawn, and the suspense will keep Harry Potter fans on tenterhooks waiting  for the next installment.  Ms. Rowling keeps getting better and better.  It's a marvelous book.  Now I have to go and read it again.
