The 4th Harry Potter book shows the author gaining confidence and developing an increasingly complex realm for fantasy. This is becoming a  tense saga, and is nicely paced and well-executed. Each book is exciting  and interesting on its own merits, and there is a greater payoff when you  read all of them. What a joy to read something like this!
