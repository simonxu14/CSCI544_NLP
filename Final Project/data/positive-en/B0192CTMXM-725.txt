I like just about everyone else waitied on pins and needles until my copy of Harry#5 arrived. I could have finished it the day I was delivered. However I forced myself to take it slow to savor the book, it's anyones guess when Harry#6 will be available.I enjoyed the storyline for the most part. It was good to see that it was not business as usual for the cast of characters. It was also a change to see Harry acting more like a normal teenager for once. As always the author is able to spin a rather outstanding tale and captivate the reader. Now having said all that I would like to touch on why this is not a 5 star review. I would have liked a bit more in terms of surprises or plot twists. The author tried that at the end but it kind of fell flat for me. Also there was alot made of the death of a major character, not sure if I consider this charcter (I will NOT give it away!!!!)a major one. However don't think for a second that I will not pre-order Harry#6 the minute I am able to do so.  The best thing about this fantastic series is that it gets children to want to pick up a book and read. So don't wait,order it and ENJOY!!!!!
