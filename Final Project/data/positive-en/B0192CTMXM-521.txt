If Rowling intended for Harry to go out with a bang and a boom, she succeeded. Both for her plucky character (and perhaps a bit for herself).  She finally breaks the barrier between childish escapism and the harsh realities of evil-perhaps plunging some of her younger fans into waters they are unable to navigate. (Ahoy thair be sharks here)<br /><br />One thing is for certain throughout-Rowling has poured more of herself into this tome as if to inbue the Deathly Hallows with a bit of her own soul-our own Horcrux for the fans. That is how I will always remember it in that first reading, an exhaustively written story, which could not have been created without some serious reflection.<br /><br />The Deathly Hallows is, simply put, a firecracker whose sizzling fuse resonates from chapter to chapter culminating to its bittersweet ending. It rarely lets up, from start to finish.  Questions that have haunted us for years are answered as our resilient Dumbledorians grapple with a wizarding world that has gone truly mad.<br /><br />Hermione finally recognizes who is truly in her heart-Ron stumbles from immaturity to take the lead in some sequences, Neville is finally worthy of his parents Auror legacy, Snapes' astounding and poignant declaration, the remorse of the Dursley's (well at least one of them feels remorse)all of it ends up too dizzying for words.<br /><br />What fans will find most exciting is that the Order of the Phoenix and Dumbledore's Army realize they are not alone, that the wizarding community from the giants, to the trolls, to the house elves, to the goblins will not be put down by insidious Death Eater propaganda. Even a coup d'etat at the Ministry of Magic will not stamp out the hope radiating from the united.<br /><br />Fans will forever remember the scene in the Lord of the Rings when entire Middle Earth banded together against a common foe. So is the same with Harry and his followers as they batten down the hatches. Truly, Hogwarts is a fitting place-the only place for the final battle to unfold, its bastion of chilish innocence coming face-to-face with a war brought to its door.<br /><br />It is these connections that permeate and reinforce the strength of the story, the only elemental allegory that we recognize-that of good and evil. even Harry, as their unwitting leader, and as the sacrificial lamb, learns that painful lesson at King's Cross.<br /><br />Rowling gives us a glorious calvacade that is deadly, vivid, melancholy and bittersweet, but oh so satisfying. Some will be left crying, some wanting more, feeling in wont of a friend, and perhaps some will also be replete, satisfied and are able to push away filled without need for more.<br /><br />It is truly an end of an era. We'll miss you Harry.Copyright(c)Nicola Mattos
