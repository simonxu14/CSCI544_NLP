JK Rowling has once again proved how masterfully she has created the world of Harry Potter.  Those of us who believe in the magic of the everyday have a lot to enjoy in this final installment of the series.<br /><br />Rowling has done a remarkable job of "growing" Harry, Hermione, Ron and the adult characters as well.  I'm re-reading the earlier volumes, partly in result of refreshing myself on some details I'd forgotten when introduced in Deathly Hallows.<br /><br />While some Good may be sacrificed to Evil, believe in what's right.  It's ironic to me that Harry has doubts not unlike Mother Teresa's doubts that have come to light in her letters - it is not our faith that makes us strong so much as faith carrying us through the times when it's most difficult to believe in anything.<br /><br />Buy the series - buy this book.
