Naturally, like many other avid Harry Potter readers, I was very excited for this book. When I got my copy, I did not hestitate to begin reading what would become the end of Harry Potter's story as we know it.<br /><br />This book kept my attention quite well with great imagery and sad, heartful moments all around. The death's experienced in this final tale will have you crying right along with the rest in the Harry Potter universe.<br /><br />The ending was excellent, a book I will return to read over and over again, minus the epilogue, which seemed as if it were a fanfiction and not something from the clever mind of J.K. Rowling herself. I just feel as if it were rushed and not really thought through. Something more for a way younger crowd, than for all readers.
