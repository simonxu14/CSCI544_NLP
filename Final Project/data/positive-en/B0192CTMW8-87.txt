This is where you really start to notice the changes from the movie and the book. I much prefer the book version of Gilderoy Lockheart. He's a total git in the book, but I enjoy it. It's much more interesting to read. You also pick up on more of the dialogue in the movies. For someone like me who isn't British that's a big deal.
